The next game in the franchise, Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location, was scheduled to release this coming Friday, October 7th, but if developer Scott Cawthon is to be believed, the project has been delayed by a few months.', 'According to a post by Cawthon on the Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location Steam page, the game is being delayed because it’s too dark. Cawthon said that some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick, and so he is thinking about delaying the game so that he can rework it entirely ""into something kid-friendly.""', 'Delays happen in the gaming industry all the time, but it’s rare for a game to be delayed mere days before its release. Five Nights at Freddy’s fans are confused and angry about this latest development, as many were looking forward to playing the game on Friday. Something else upsetting fans is Cawthon’s reasoning that the game is too dark to release, as being dark and disturbing are two characteristics that many consumers look for in a horror game.', 'Cawthon’s reason for suddenly delaying Five Nights at Freddy’s Sister Location from its planned October 7th release date doesn’t make much sense. A more likely scenario is that this is just a weird publicity stunt meant to hype the game as being so disturbing that its developer almost didn’t even release it. Alternatively, perhaps Cawthon is delaying the game for technical reasons and decided to concoct this story instead of admitting that the fifth core game in the series has issues.', 'Fans should also consider the possibility that Cawthon is just trolling in an attempt to throw them off the scent of an early release. Cawthon has a habit of surprising fans by releasing Five Nights at Freddy’s games early, and it wouldn’t be all that shocking for Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location to carry on that tradition, despite Cawthon’s post to the contrary.', 'With October 7th just a few days away, fans will learn soon enough whether or not Cawthon is serious about Sister Location‘s delay. If the game is delayed, it will be interesting to see if Cawthon actually does rework it to be more ""kid-friendly,"" or if he goes with a slightly altered version of his original vision.', 'Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location is scheduled to launch on October 7th for PC as well as iOS and Android mobile devices.', 'Source: Scott Cawthon']",Five Nights at Freddy’s Sequel Delayed for Weird Reason,"Five Nights at Freddy's creator Scott Cawthon takes to Steam to tease a possible delay for Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location, the fifth game in the series.",,"['https://gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/five-nights-at-freddys-sister-location-puppets.jpg', 'https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-UeXruRVtZz7w6.gif', 'https://gamerant.com/wp-content/themes/9.0/images/logo-3.png', 'https://gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/five-nights-at-freddys-sister-location-puppets-700x389.jpg', 'https://gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/Five-Nights-at-Freddys-Cover-Art.jpg', 'https://gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/five-nights-at-freddys-sister-location-clown-animatronic-700x389.png', 'https://gamerant.com/wp-content/themes/9.0/images/logo-4.jpg']",https://gamerant.com/five-nights-at-freddys-sequel-delay/?utm_content=inf_124_3412_2&utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=Partner&utm_campaign=SocialEdge&tse_id=INF_e34a10a08b0811e6b6db4d0235f40af5,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': ""They think It's too dark. #StopClickBait"", 'spoilerPublisher': 'Stop Clickbait - Gaming'}",['some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick'],"[[[2, 158], [2, 236]]]",['passage']

PHOENIX — A single word — ""intentionally"" — could transform a court case against Phoenix-area Sheriff Joe Arpaio from civil charges to a criminal prosecution.', 'In finding Arpaio and three of his top commanders in contempt of court on Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow said no fewer than 19 times that the sheriff or his aides had repeatedly and intentionally violated judicial orders to stop profiling Latinos. On May 31, Snow will determine the civil penalties and examine whether Arpaio, the sheriff of Arizona’s Maricopa County, will be referred to Arizona’s U.S. attorney for potential criminal charges.', 'Arpaio has acknowledged violating Snow’s order, but said it was a mistake. In weighing criminal charges, Snow must decide whether Arpaio’s violations of his orders were intentional.', 'In the meantime, the judge had unusually harsh words for Arpaio.', '""The Defendants’ unfair, partial, and inequitable application of discipline disproportionally (sic) damaged members of the Plaintiff class,"" Snow wrote.', 'In a 2011 civil case brought by Latino drivers against Arpaio and his aides, Snow determined that Arpaio had encouraged his deputies to subject Latino drivers to greater scrutiny during traffic stops than white drivers typically received. He ordered the sheriff to put an end to the practice.', 'Two years later, Snow found that Arpaio had continued the practice in violation of the order. At a Houston rally the next year, Arpaio told supporters that he had violated the order ""out of spite"" and had arrested 500 people.', 'He later said in court filings that he had violated the order unknowingly.', 'In Friday’s ruling, Arpaio was held in contempt on three counts. Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was found in contempt on two counts, and retired Chief Brian Sands and Lt. Joe Sousa each were found in contempt on one count.', '""The Court finds that the Defendants have engaged in multiple acts of misconduct, dishonesty, and bad faith,"" Snow wrote. ""In their testimony during the evidentiary hearing, Sheriff Arpaio and Chief Deputy Sheridan made multiple intentional misstatements of fact while under oath.""', 'In hearings last year, Arpaio, the octogenarian who calls himself ""America’s toughest sheriff,"" seemed to wither under questioning, particularly when asked about an effort he had made to investigate the judge.', 'A lawyer for Arpaio had hired a private investigator to look into comments Snow’s wife purportedly made in a restaurant, where an informant claimed she had said the judge didn’t want to see Arpaio reelected.', 'Arpaio apologized to Snow for the investigation, but the sheriff’s attorneys also used the incident to argue that Snow was no longer impartial and should recuse himself from the case. Snow declined.', 'In his contempt ruling, Snow said Arpaio and his aides failed to turn over video evidence to plaintiffs in the civil case, disobeyed orders to gather evidence and continued to profile Latinos.', 'Snow found that Arpaio hid thousands of pieces of evidence from the plaintiffs and deleted relevant digital evidence kept on hard drives.', 'Longtime opponents immediately called for the sheriff to resign.', '""Any public official who has been found guilty of racial profiling and ignores the orders of the court cannot be entrusted with the safety and well-being of the community and should step down in shame,"" the immigrant rights group Puente Arizona said in a statement Friday.', 'The ACLU, which brought the original case against Arpaio, demanded stricter oversight and transparency from the sheriff’s office.', '""Strong remedies are needed to protect the community’s rights, starting with internal investigations that root out and punish misconduct,"" said Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. ""Willing or not, the sheriff will be made to comply with the law.""', 'The ruling Friday was one of Arpaio’s most serious defeats, but it doesn’t bar him from holding office, and he had already announced his intention to run for a seventh term as sheriff in November.']",Why Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s fate could hang on a single word,"<p>A single word — ""intentionally"" — could transform a

cf3cb892-fb30-4210-a525-e5e7aa921082,4l1vka,"you won't believe this stunning ""harry potter"" revelation about professor mcgonagall",reddit,"['From reading J.K. Rowling‘s Harry Potter saga, and watching the films, we know a lot about one of our favorite professors and Head of Gryffindor house, Professor Minerva McGonagall. Stern but fair, McGonagall expected a lot from her students, but she also cared for them deeply, even if she didn’t always outwardly express it. However, what if there was something about Professor McGonagall that we never thought about before? Reddit user Obversa made a stunning revelation about one of the most bad-ass witches in the entire HP saga.', 'Obversa suggests that ""Professor McGonagall was originally hired by Dumbledore to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts (DADA) in 1956. However, not long after, Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) came back to Hogwarts, seeking the DADA position for himself. Dumbledore denied Voldemort’s application and as a result, Voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any DADA professor from ‘lasting more than a year’. Dumbledore then transferred McGonagall to the Transfiguration position before the term’s end, to prevent anything ""bad"" or ""dangerous"" from happening to her. After all, as long as she wasn’t teaching DADA , the jinx technically wouldn’t apply to her."" Obversa says, ""Prior to being Headmaster, Dumbledore served as Transfiguration professor for several decades, teaching Tom Riddle himself as a child. He was also McGonagall’s predecessor, under Headmaster Armando Dippet. Thus, when Dumbledore succeeded Dippet, he would have left a vacancy for the spot of Transfiguration."" We know that Minerva McGonagall filled this vacancy, but what led her there?', 'As a result of Pottermore, we know a bit more about Professor McGonagall’s backstory (which is extremely similar to Lord Voldermort’s background). McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore’s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement. But why would Dumbledore hire a brilliant McGonagall just as his assistant and not to a full teaching position when she first arrived back at Hogwarts? If you recall, one of the reasons why Headmaster Dippet rejected Tom Riddle’s application for the DADA teaching position, at age 17-18 for Tom, was because Tom was ""too young"". However, Dippet encouraged Tom ""to come back a few to several years later to apply again"". At the time, McGonagall was still perhaps too young, to be a Hogwarts professor in her own right.', 'Additionally, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix McGonagall told Dolores Umbridge that she had been teaching at Hogwarts for ""Thirty-nine years this December"". Order of the Phoenix takes place in 1995 and 1996, with this statement coming in approximately September 1995. Therefore, McGonagall’s official hiring would have been in the middle of the school year, very odd timing. But, why would McGonagall who is obviously gifted in Transfiguration initially apply to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor?', 'Take note of Professor McGonagall’s wand. It’s made of Fir with a core of Dragon Heartstring. The Wandmaker Ollivander once called it the, ‘the survivor’s wand,’ because he had sold it to three wizards who subsequently passed through mortal peril unscathed. This means that if the wand chooses the wizard, McGonagall would have been destined for a lot more than Transfiguration.', 'It seems likely then that McGonagall started teaching as Dumbledore’s assistant in December of 1956, and, at some point, applied for (and received) the DADA job. However, Lord Voldemort arrived to Hogwarts shortly thereafter wanting to snag the position for himself. Once Dumbledore refused, Voldy put a hex on the position, so McGonagall had to be transferred to Transfiguration. After all, the Dark Lord was probably, ""angry, vindictive, and jealous of McGonagall, and wanted to take his revenge for what he saw as ""what was rightfully his"". He was also obsessed with the similarities between the amazingly gifted witch. Just as he was continually obsessed with the similarities between Harry Potter and himself throughout the entire saga.']",You Won’t Believe This Stunning ‘Harry Potter’ Revelation About Professor McGonagall,This stunning revelation about Professor McGonagall changes everything we thought we knew about the Harry Potter saga!,,"['http://www.media4.hw-static.com/media/2016/05/maggie-smith-harry-potter-warner-bros-052516-638x425.jpg', 'http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-ef1y0A8erBLUc.gif', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7', 'http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3002265&cv=2.0&cj=1']",http://www.hollywood.com/movies/you-wont-believe-this-stunning-harry-potter-revelation-about-professor-mcgonagall-60584784/,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'She was hired to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, but after Tom Riddle cursed the position, Dumbledore moved her to Transfiguration to protect her.', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}","['McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore’s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement.']","[[[2, 147], [2, 230]]]",['passage']

But what was in the insecticide, and how does it work?', 'The main ingredient of the insecticide, Dibrom, is the chemical naled. It works by killing mosquitoes on contact. Sprayers produce very fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight.', 'Naled does not pose a health risk to either people or pets when sprayed in low concentrations, according to both the Environmental Protection Agency (PDF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.', 'However, in its own review of naled, the European Union came to a different conclusion. Naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the EU scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations. As a result, the EU has banned agricultural use of products containing naled.', 'In Puerto Rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of Zika, recommendations from the CDC and the EPA to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests. Activists organized a June 28 demonstration outside the San Juan CDC and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment.', ""By contrast, in Miami-Dade County, the Department of Solid Waste Management's Mosquito Control Section commonly sprays in response to state Department of Health investigations -- and when residents request the use of insecticide."", 'The Mosquito Control Section has applied naled via an ultra-low-volume spray for many years, officials said in a news release. In fact, Dibrom has been used in the United States over the past 50 years, said Timothy J. Donnelly, vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel of AMVAC Chemical Corp ., which makes the insecticide.', '""It is regularly sprayed in 12 states on over 15 million acres each year,"" Donnelly said.', 'Since the variety of mosquito that carries Zika is most active predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times. Special precautions are not necessary, Miami-Dade County officials advised, though people with allergies may want to remain indoors. During any insecticide operation, it is recommended that beekeepers cover their bees.', ""Aerial spraying, which lasts about an hour, was recommended by the CDC and Florida's Department of Health to reduce the population of adult mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading viruses, including Zika. Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the aerial spraying operation was delayed because of poor weather conditions."", '""When Naled gets sprayed, it knocks out the mosquitoes, but if sprayed over water, it breaks down quickly,"" said Bryn Phillips, a specialist in the University of California, Davis environmental toxicology department.', 'His research indicates that the insecticide breaks down into different chemical versions of Naled. One of these versions, dichlorvos, is quite toxic to aquatic species at the ""low end of the food chain,"" like aquatic insects and frog larvae -- ""basically fish food,"" Phillips said.', 'If the chemicals are rotated and managed properly, an environmental area can recover, Phillips noted.', 'Naled spray droplets stay airborne for an extended period, and the chemical begins to break down once exposed to sunlight or water. Very little of the low-concentration spray settles on the ground. Those who worry that they may have come into contact with the chemicals should wash, county officials advised; any food that may have been exposed should be rinsed before eating. Since concentrations are far below what is harmful to humans, symptoms, such as skin irritation or headache, are unlikely.', ""Miami-Dade County's aerial spraying alternates between naled and an insecticide called BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, a naturally occurring bacterium), which targets mosquito larvae instead of adult mosquitoes. BTI has been registered with the EPA since 1961 as a pesticide."", ""Zika was discovered in 1947 in Uganda. An outbreak that began in Brazil in 2015 has spread throughout the Americas. Florida reported the nation's first local transmission of Zika from an infected mosquito in late July."", 'Zika has been shown to be responsible for an alarming increase in microcephaly, in which babies are born with small brains and heads, as well as other hearing, vision and developmental disorders.', 'Although spraying insecticides raises concerns about toxicity to aquatic life, policy-makers must weigh the potential costs to human health by not spraying and costs to environmental health by spraying, Phillips said.', 'Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.', '""You talk to the mosquito spraying guys, and they\'re all about human health, and they\'re OK with some impacts to the environment,"" he said. Yet some environmentalists are not OK with any effects to land and sea, he said.', '""It\'s a balancing act,"" Phillips said.']",What are mosquito-control workers spraying in Miami?,"Officials sprayed an insecticide containing naled over a 10-square-mile portion in Miami-Dade County.

Well maybe now we’ve sparked your curiosity.', 'They don’t fart—detectably. There’s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn’t seem like anyone has ever truly observed—or more importantly, measured—a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate?', 'As Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don’t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird’s gastrointestinal tract, he’d be concerned something was wrong with the bird.', 'But Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there’s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected.', 'In another blog post, she describes the only written account she’s aware of describing a possible bird fart. It comes from former Cornell student Alan Richard Weisbrod, in his 1965 master’s thesis on blue jays.', 'One of the birds in front of me defecated. A small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. The feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. The gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. Several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas.', 'Weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. (And apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on Weisbrod’s observation.) He also acknowledges that the ""wisp of whitish gas"" could also have simply been water vapor—steam rising from the feces. (Just think of how your dog’s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.)', 'It’s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. According to Mental_Floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. A video by AsapSCIENCE adds that ""the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment"" and break down into its smellier components—namely sulfur. So if birds don’t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn’t smell it.', 'Without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.', 'But even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? That is less clear. According to a Q&A with proctologist Lester Gottesman in VICE, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. A lot of the gas that makes up a fart, Gottesman said, is swallowed air. And a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. But how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air?', 'As far as we could tell, this isn’t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. But the Daily Dot reached out to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for answers nonetheless. According to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab’s good-humored press officer Miyoko Chu, birds definitely swallow air. But he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. He added that he thinks birds do fart ""in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable."" He also said that he’s never personally noticed a bird fart.', 'Lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying ""excuse me"" after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. This is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird’s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed. And without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.']",Do birds fart?,,,"['https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/15c/ce/Screenshot202017-02-2620at2010.41.5720AM-500x250.png', 'https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/dailydot/img/logo_black.png', 'https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/dailydot/img/kernel-logo.png', 'https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/dailydot/img/logo_white.png', 'https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/69e/73/f7e3ca23be3c34b64675b7e636214a25.jpg', 'https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/961/ed/13443e61fc64c27236ad91a76c23c7e2-500x250.jpg', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7', 'http://cdn.relaymedia.com/ping?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailydot.com%2Fparsec%2Fdo-birds-fart%2F', 'https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/1ee/4d/167e61f4ead95121-500x250.jpg']",http://www.dailydot.com/geek/do-birds-fart/?fb=ss&prtnr=mentalfloss,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'No one is sure, but if they do it has no smell. #StopClickBait', 'spoilerPublisher': 'Stop Clickbait - Science'}",['They don’t fart'],"[[[1, 0], [1, 15]]]",['phrase']

""It\'s secreted by the pineal gland, which is at the base of the brain, and regulated by light,"" he says.

Though he does note that if you take too much of the supplement, you may feel drowsy, get a headache , or experience some short-term memory loss.

The problem is connecting to iTunes does nothing, the device is locked and forced reboots only return it the same state.', 'As for the error code itself, according to Apple’s code guide, Error 56 is loosely described as a ""hardware issue"", which doesn’t sound like a credible explanation.', 'Interestingly, from my initial investigations, it seems the newer iPad Pro 9.7 is affected far more often than the iPad Pro 12.7 (the two models have key feature differences). But the good news is there are reports of iPad Pro 9.7 models updating without problems and iPhones and other iPad models appear to be getting through unscathed.', 'So what happens now?

The video is captioned: ""This is why we beg and plead with our visitors to please refrain from touching objects in museums."" Indeed.', 'In the video, an abstract, wooden sculpture clock appeared not to be working, so a male tourist decided to take matters into his own hands, pulling on weights and levers for more than 30 seconds before the clock came flying off the wall and into pieces on the floor.

David Jolly introduced his quixotic plan to ban members of Congress from soliciting campaign contributions, the Florida Republican had only six co-sponsors.', 'Then, three weeks ago, ""60 Minutes"" did a sympathetic piece on Jolly’s idea, giving national attention to the scandal of lawmakers spending 30 or more hours a week dialing for dollars.', 'And now? The number of co-sponsors on Jolly’s bill has jumped from six all the way up to — um, eight. No senator has come forward with similar legislation.', 'Jolly, appearing Monday morning at the National Press Club with his lead Democratic co-sponsor, Rep. Rick Nolan (Minn.), was not surprised. ""We’ve got six more co-sponsors than I thought we might have,"" he said. It’s ""a heartbreaking reflection on what the priorities of the Congress are. . . . A member’s political survival depends on raising money — that’s the reality.""', 'Jolly speaks the truth. Lawmakers know what needs to be done to clean up the corrupt system — but nothing happens.', 'Democrats talk about overturning the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited sums on politics. But that ultimate fix isn’t happening soon. In the House, Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) has recruited 160 co-sponsors for his system of public financing of elections — another good idea — but so far he has only one Republican, gadfly Walter Jones (N.C.). Republicans remain reflexively opposed to reform, including the idea of disclosure, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) once championed.', 'This is why Jolly’s idea deserves a look. He calls it congressional reform, not campaign-finance reform. The goal: to get lawmakers to spend more time lawmaking. ""We’re here three days a week, and half your time is spent raising money,"" he said. ""In the face of growing crises around the globe, you’ve got a part-time Congress."" This, he said, ""is a first-rate scandal.""', 'I’ve argued for other ways to get lawmakers to spend more time working — returning to the five-day week, cutting travel allowances, ending the corrosive practice of members targeting each other for defeat through party committees. Jolly, now a Senate candidate in Florida, offers another tack.', 'The Republican Party is predictably opposed. The National Republican Congressional Committee, in a letter to CBS after the ""60 Minutes"" segment, accused Jolly of peddling ""fiction"" when he said party officials told him he had to raise $18,000 a day.', 'Unfortunately, liberals have piled on. Campaign-finance reformer Fred Wertheimer told me the idea ""is not going to solve the problem,"" because those working for the members could still solicit funds. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, wrote Unfortunately, liberals have piled on. Campaign-finance reformer Fred Wertheimer told me the idea ""is not going to solve the problem,"" because those working for the members could still solicit funds. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, wrote a piece in the Orlando Sentinel calling Jolly’s bill a ""cynical example of fraudulent reform"" because ""all that would change is that congressmen wouldn’t have to do the dirty work.""', 'But while Jolly can be accused of election-year gimmickry, he voluntarily refused to solicit contributions for his Senate run. And though the bill wouldn’t by itself solve the campaign-finance mess, it could help to improve the woeful political culture in other ways.', 'Jolly’s Democratic sidekick, Nolan, said that when he first served in Congress in the 1970s, lawmakers worked full weeks, giving them time to develop respect for one another and to find common ground.', '""If you’ve already consumed 40, 50 hours of the week in travel and fundraising, there’s not a lot of time left over for governing, and we’re seeing the results of that,"" he said. ""We’re looking at the last couple of sessions of the Congress of the United States as being the most unproductive in the history of the country. Why? Well, if everybody’s busy campaigning and raising money, there’s no time for governing.""', 'The little support Jolly has gained for the idea comes largely from Florida, home to three of his eight co-sponsors, including Democrat Alan Grayson, also a Senate candidate. A Democratic congressional candidate in Florida, businessman Randy Perkins, went one step further, announcing he would stop ""soliciting or accepting"" financial contributions.', 'But Jolly, a former lobbyist and longtime staffer to the late congressman C.W. Bill Young, continues to agitate. He said he’s not paying his $400,000 in dues to the NRCC, and he said ""I don’t buy the notion"" that he needs more sponsors before House leadership grants a hearing on his bill.', 'Jolly is a potential ally of Democrats on campaign-finance reform, saying that Citizens United ""could be revisited"" and that ""we can do better."" Until then, surely more lawmakers on both sides can see the virtue of his cause. ""You think you get elected to represent 700,000 people,"" he said. ""But you actually got elected to be one more marble on our side of the aisle to keep the majority, and to do that you’ve got to go raise $2 million — and that makes members angry.""', 'Or at least it should.']",Lawmakers could do this to fight corruption.

What’s more, then and there, despite having no experience of rearing animals, he vowed to nurse the poor baby back to health.', 'This took place in 2013 on the sizzling streets of Tampa. Longo, a Florida native, thought that the little thing didn’t look good, and he knew that the unrelenting sunshine was taking its toll.', 'Indeed, Longo later recounted how the helpless baby was ""half-dead"" when they first met. And so, despite having no clue even as to what the animal was, he decided to take it back to his home in St. Petersburg.', 'Consequently, Longo christened the critter Biscuits and began to hand-rear her himself. Clearly, then, the first order of the day was to give the adorable and tiny creature, which was just over an inch in length, some major TLC.', 'However, without an inkling of even which species Biscuits belonged to, Longo didn’t have the first idea about how best to raise her. So, this being the 21st century and all, he began to research his new-found friend online.', 'First, Longo went to Reddit to ask the website’s online community for help. However, most of the responses were from people telling him, simply, that there was no way he’d manage to raise Biscuits on his own. Undeterred, though, Longo continued his research and eventually discovered the answer he was looking for.', 'It turned out that he was going to be looking after a southern flying squirrel. Naturally, this species of squirrel usually resides in forests and woods, using trees as their habitat. They furthermore survive on a diet of nuts, seeds, fruit and insects as well as eggs and birds.', 'The gliding rodents are nocturnal, and young squirrels tend to stay with their mothers until they are at least two months old. Since Biscuits had somehow become separated from her family, then, it was now down to Longo to fill her mother’s shoes.', 'So, for two months, Longo took Biscuits everywhere with him – even to work. He even bottle-fed her with a mix of puppy formula and heavy cream.', 'As each day passed, Biscuits grew bigger and stronger, until she eventually became a healthy adult squirrel. In addition to getting the gift of life, though, Biscuits had also, again thanks to her encounter with Longo, gained a new family.', 'Indeed, alongside her surrogate mother, Biscuits gained some four-legged family friends – in the shape of Longo’s dogs.

I played on winter leagues, and woke up early for 6 am pickup games. Freshman and sophomore years, I made it onto the junior varsity team — a miracle."", ""By 11th grade, it was time to try out for varsity lacrosse. This is when my history teacher — the varsity coach — pulled me aside and suggested I shouldn't bother. I'd probably be cut, he said (adding that I was getting very good grades)."", 'For me, practice did not make perfect. Lo and behold, I now have scientific validation.', ""A meta-analysis in Perspectives in Psychological Science looked at 33 studies on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement and found that practice just doesn't matter that much."", ""More precisely, the analysis found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success. Put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players, the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one player's average is better than the other."", 'Even more simply: Some people are just better at sports than others, and the difference cannot be made up by practice alone. There was a reason I lagged behind my peers on the lacrosse field. They probably had a natural advantage on me.', '""One important thing — that\'s easy to misunderstand— is that this is looking at variance across people, not within an individual,"" Brooke Macnamara, the lead author of the Perspectives paper, tells me. ""So if a person practices, they will get better. Almost across the board, practice should improve one’s performance.""', 'But it also means that for the same amount of practice, some will end up being better at sports than others. ""Essentially, learning rates vary,"" Macnamara says. ""Some people improve very quickly with less practice, while others require much more practice.""', 'The analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played. Practice accounts for the same difference in performance in bowling as it does field hockey, two completely different activities.', 'Practice also explains fewer differences in ability the further an athlete ascends into higher levels of play. Which suggests ""deliberate practice loses its predictive power beyond a certain level of skill,"" the study reports. The analysis also found that the age when athletes started their sports didn\'t change this figure much either.', 'So what, then, explains the remaining 82 percent?', ""Here's where we should note a limitation of studying practice: Researchers typically ask athletes to recall their schedules and practice hours, and memories can be faulty."", ""But Macnamara doesn't think better measurements of practice would make that 18 percent figure leap up to near 100."", '""There’s probably not one huge contributor that’s accounting for everything else,"" she says.', ""Instead, there's likely a whole constellation of factors — some of which are genetic or biological in nature — that explain why some people are better athletes than others. They include:"", 'Personality and perseverance', 'Propensity to get injured', 'Propensity to choke under pressure', 'Individual differences in maximum oxygen uptake', 'Differences in how we acquire muscle mass', 'Coordination', 'Height', 'Enjoyment of competition', '""We have so many factors within a person that can contribute to [athletic performance] — different genes, different cognitive abilities, different physical attributes,"" she says. ""All of those things are important and interact with each other. Which is why it is so hard to pin down what predicts performance.""', 'Overall, she says the finding is a strike against the popular ""10,000 hour rule,"" which implies anyone can become master at an activity if they were to just devote the time to it. The research in sports, and in other activities such as music, games, and education, just doesn\'t back that hypothesis up.', ""On the other hand, it's not like these findings are an excuse not to try."", '""Eighteen percent is big,"" Macnamara says. ""We\'re trying to argue against these ideas that it\'s so important it accounts for nearly everything."" Practice matters, but it\'s unlikely to bridge the gap between inborn superstars and your average, or perhaps clumsy, kid.', 'For the athletically un-inclined, like myself, it\'s a bit of a relief. It\'s okay if you can\'t make up the difference with practice, or if you\'re just a ""slow learner"" when it comes to sports. It\'s also okay to just enjoy being on a team, trying hard but knowing you\'ll unlikely be the best.', 'Growing up, my dad was on a quest to find ""my sport"" — the activity I\'d finally master. Lacrosse was the closest we came. But it was mostly a parade of failures. Baseball: Throw a ball at me and I\'ll be more likely to bruise than catch it. Soccer: I was much too slow. Basketball: All of the above. Tennis: I was cut from the middle school team.', ""I'm not a well-coordinated person, and that's just fine."", ""These days I stick to activities that don't involve hand-eye coordination: hiking, biking, running, skiing.

0bea20e0-5e8e-46dd-a5fc-f3d955bc164e,745678982037835777,cancer is contagious among clams. what about us?,Twitter,"['""We were always thinking there would be more contagious cancer out there, but we didn’t know where they would be discovered,"" said Elizabeth P. Murchison, a cancer biologist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the new study.', 'In the traditional view of cancer, mutations strike a cell. These mutations have several causes, including toxins and viruses.', 'However they arise, they drive a cell to multiply uncontrollably until the cancer is wiped out by the immune system or kills its victim. Either way, the cancer stays inside the body where it started.', 'A decade ago, scientists discovered two exceptions. In the 1990s Tasmanian devils in Australia began developing deadly face tumors. But DNA in the tumor cells did not match that of the affected animals, studies showed.', 'Tasmanian facial tumor disease, as it was eventually called, appears to have had its start in a single Tasmanian devil that lived in the 1980s. Transmitted by bites, the cancer spread to other Tasmanian devils and acquired mutations along the way that helped make it even more infectious. A second strain of the cancer was identified last year.', 'Dogs, too, can get a type of contagious cancer called canine transmissible venereal tumor, which jumps from host to host during sex. The tumor usually disappears in a few months, however. Scientists have determined that the cancer originated in dogs 11,000 years ago.', 'For years, Tasmanian devils and dogs were the only species known to contract contagious cancer. But last year, Stephen P. Goff, a molecular biologist at Columbia University, and his colleagues found contagious cancer in soft-shell clams.', 'From New York to Prince Edward Island, these clams have suffered from aggressive tumors since the 1970s. Carol Reinisch, a marine biologist at Environment Canada, found that the cancer clustered in populations, as if it was caused by an outbreak of some sort.', 'She suspected a cancer-causing virus moving from host to host. For help, Dr. Reinisch turned to Dr. Goff.', 'The two researchers found no evidence of a virus in the soft-shell clams. But they did discover that DNA in the tumor cells carried a genetic sequence not found in healthy cells in the clams.', 'After examining the DNA, they confirmed that the cancer cells in different clams all came from a single common ancestor.', '""Somehow, this cancer has been spreading from clam to clam up the coast,"" Dr. Goff said.', 'He and his colleagues began to wonder if other species of clams or related animals — known collectively as bivalves — had contagious cancers of their own, and, if so, why. They chose to study cancers in mussels, cockles and golden carpet shell clams.', 'In every case, the researchers reported in the journal Nature, the cancers in the animals were contagious. ""We are now at four for four,"" Dr. Goff said.', 'As it turned out, the cancer in cockles comprises two separate strains. Even stranger, the cancer cells in the golden carpet shell clams did not develop from the species’s own cells.', 'Instead, the scientists matched the cancer’s DNA to pullet shell clams, which live in the same intertidal beds off the coast of Spain. But Dr. Goff and his colleagues could not locate any pullet shell clams with this disease.', 'They concluded that this strain of contagious cancer must have started in pullet shell clams and then jumped species, infecting golden carpet shell clams. It killed all the vulnerable pullet shell clams, leaving only resistant ones behind.', '""That’s really quite incredible,"" Dr. Murchison said, noting that scientists had tried without success to infect foxes and other dog relatives with canine cancer. The new study, she said, shows that contagious cancer can indeed cross the species barrier.', 'With eight contagious cancers now on the books, Dr. Murchison has started to wonder if they are not as peculiar as previously thought. ""They might be emerging fairly often,"" she said.', 'So should people worry about an outbreak of infectious cancer? ""I don’t think we should be starting to panic,"" Dr. Murchison said.', 'There have been rare reports of people transmitting cancer. An estimated 0.04 percent of organ transplant recipients contract cancer from the donor organ, for example. But in these cases, the cancer does not spread like a true parasite from host to host.', 'Yet it’s not inconceivable that a human cancer might gain that power. In 1965, scientists put mosquitoes in a cage with hamsters, one of which had cancer. The mosquito carried the cancer cells to the healthy hamsters.', 'The new research ""does raise the possibility that these types of diseases could arise in humans,"" Dr. Murchison said.', 'Dr. Goff and his colleagues are now trying to turn the contagious cancer in shellfish into a model for human cancers. They hope to find clues to metastasis, the way cancer spreads through the body.', 'The evolution of a contagious cancer in some ways may mirror the evolution of a single tumor in the body. In shellfish, Dr. Murchison said, ""we can see the effect of evolution on their genomes in a more pronounced way.""']",Cancer Is Contagious Among Clams.

He said that previous U.S. military actions like the war in Afghanistan or 1990s air strikes on Bosnia ""didn\'t get the same reaction.""

Today , that number is 21.""', 'Belay says the disease is ""a little bit concerning"" because, unlike mad cow disease and kuru, where infectious prions were concentrated in the brain and nervous system tissue, in an animal with chronic wasting disease, the misfolded prions show up all over the body. They can even be found in saliva, feces and urine, which could explain how the disease is spreading so quickly among wild deer and elk.', 'The CDC is working with public health authorities in Wyoming and Colorado to monitor hunters for signs of prion disease.', '""Unfortunately, because these diseases have long incubation periods, it\'s not easy to monitor transmission,"" says Belay.

The majority of people no longer assume that southpaws are tools of Satan, alight with hellfire. Today’s lefties are surrounded by a far more benevolent glow. We associate left-handedness with intelligence, out-of-the-box thinking, and artistic talent. But are these flattering generalizations backed up by science? Does being left-handed really make you more creative?', 'The answer to that is a definitive ... maybe.', 'Scientists have been chipping away at the peculiarities of left-handedness, which occurs in about 10 percent of the population, for a long time. They’ve looked into the purported links between left-handedness and things like mental illness, faulty immune systems, and criminal behavior. They’ve studied whether lefties are better at problem-solving, and if they’re more likely to die young. From all these studies on left-handedness, we can conclude one thing, and one thing alone: science is complicated.', 'A handful of studies have found a link between left-handedness and creativity, conferred, some think, by the fact that left-handed folks constantly have to adjust to a right-handed world. Other studies found no link at all.', 'Some researchers conclude that lefties are no smarter than righties, while others say that left-handedness comes with a clear intellectual advantage. Is there really a left-handed personality? Are lefties more prone to schizophrenia and learning disabilities? That depends on who you ask.', 'But ""Are lefties different?"" might not even be the right question. Over the last few years, a number of studies have concluded that it’s not which hand is dominant that matters—it’s the degree of dominance. According to researchers, very few people are truly entirely left- or right-handed; it’s more of a spectrum. We use our left hands for some things and our right hands for other tasks.', 'These experiments have found that people toward the middle of the spectrum are more flexible thinkers. They seem to be more empathetic and better able to view things from other people’s perspectives. When considering the risks and benefits of any given decision, inconsistent-handed people (as researchers call them) are more likely to focus on the risks, whereas people at the outer edges of the handedness spectrum pay more attention to potential benefits. They may even sleep differently. It seems we’ve been aiming our stereotypes a little too far to the left.', 'But who knows? This is ever-changing, constantly evolving science.

957d0be7-11dc-4ca4-9b65-bbbf9d151523,53dovb,what it feels like to die,reddit,"['""Do you want to know what will happen as your body starts shutting down?"" My mother and I sat across from the hospice nurse in my parents’ Colorado home. It was 2005, and my mother had reached the end of treatments for metastatic breast cancer. A month or two earlier, she’d been able to take the dog for daily walks in the mountains and travel to Australia with my father. Now, she was weak, exhausted from the disease and chemotherapy and pain medication. My mother had been the one to decide, with her doctor’s blessing, to stop pursuing the dwindling chemo options, and she had been the one to ask her doctor to call hospice. Still, we weren’t prepared for the nurse’s question. My mother and I exchanged glances, a little shocked. But what we felt most was a sense of relief. During six-and-a-half years of treatment, although my mother saw two general practitioners, six oncologists, a cardiologist, several radiation technicians, nurses at two chemotherapy facilities, and surgeons at three different clinics—not once, to my knowledge, had anyone talked to her about what would happen as she died.', 'There’s good reason. ""Roughly from the last two weeks until the last breath, somewhere in that interval, people become too sick, or too drowsy, or too unconscious, to tell us what they’re experiencing,"" says Margaret Campbell, a professor of nursing at Wayne State University who has worked in palliative care for decades. The way death is talked about tends to be based on what family, friends, and medical professionals see, rather than accounts of what dying actually feels like. James Hallenbeck, a palliative-care specialist at Stanford University, often compares dying to black holes. ""We can see the effect of black holes, but it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to look inside them. They exert an increasingly strong gravitational pull the closer one gets to them. As one passes the ‘event horizon,’ apparently the laws of physics begin to change."" What does dying feel like? Despite a growing body of research about death, the actual, physical experience of dying—the last few days or moments—remains shrouded in mystery. Medicine is just beginning to peek beyond the horizon. * * * Until about 100 years ago, almost all dying happened quickly. But modern medicine has radically changed how long the end of life can be stretched. Now, Americans who have access to medical care often die gradually, of lingering diseases like most terminal cancers or complications from diabetes or dementia, rather than quickly from, say, a farm accident or the flu. According to the Centers for Disease Control’s most recent figures, Americans are most likely to die of heart disease, cancer, or chronic pulmonary lung disease. ""Pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness."" For those who do die gradually, there’s often a final, rapid slide that happens in roughly the last few days of life—a phase known as ""active dying."" During this time, Hallenbeck writes in Palliative Care Perspectives, his guide to palliative care for physicians, people tend to lose their senses and desires in a certain order. ""First hunger and then thirst are lost. Speech is lost next, followed by vision. The last senses to go are usually hearing and touch.""', 'Whether dying is physically painful, or how painful it is, appears to vary. ""There are some kinds of conditions where pain is inevitable,"" Campbell says. ""There are some patients that just get really, really old and just fade away, and there’s no distress."" Having a disease associated with pain doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily endure a difficult death, either. Most people dying of cancer need pain medication to keep them comfortable, Campbell notes—and the medicine usually works. ""If they’re getting a good, comprehensive pain regimen, they can die peacefully,"" she says. When people become too weak to cough or swallow, some start to make a noise in the backs of their throats. The sound can be deeply disturbing, as if the patient is suffering. But that’s not what it feels like to the person dying, as far as doctors can tell. In fact, medical researchers believe that the phenomenon—which is commonly called a death rattle—probably doesn’t hurt. Ultimately, because most people lose awareness or consciousness in their last few hours or days, it’s hard to know for certain how much patients are suffering. ""We generally believe that if your brain is really in a comatose kind of situation, or you’re not really responsive, that your perception—how you feel about things—may also be significantly decreased,"" says David Hui, an oncologist and palliative-care specialist who researches the signs of approaching death. ""You may or may not even be aware of what’s happening.""', '* * * A week or two after we spoke to the nurse, my mother sank into a state where she was rarely conscious. When she was awake, it was only the most basic part of her that was there: the part that told her legs to move to get her to the bathroom, the automated steps in brushing her teeth and then wiping the sink afterward. Her mind turned away from her children and husband for the first time. I wanted to know what she was thinking about. I wanted to know where her mind was. Being at the bedside of an unresponsive dying person can feel like trying to find out whether someone is home by looking through thick-curtained windows. Is the person sleeping, dreaming, experiencing something supernatural? Is her mind gone? For many dying people, ""the brain does the same thing that the body does in that it starts to sacrifice areas which are less critical to survival,"" says David Hovda, director of the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center. He compares the breakdown to what happens in aging: People tend to lose their abilities for complex or executive planning, learning motor skills—and, in what turns out to be a very important function, inhibition. ""The waves get higher and higher, and eventually, they carry the person out to sea."" ""As the brain begins to change and start to die, different parts become excited, and one of the parts that becomes excited is the visual system,"" Hovda explains. ""And so that’s where people begin to see light.""', 'Recent research points to evidence that the sharpening of the senses some people report also seems to match what we know about the brain’s response to dying. Jimo Borjigin, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, first became intrigued by this subject when she noticed something strange in the brains of animals in another experiment: Just before the animals died, neurochemicals in the brain suddenly surged. While scientists had known that brain neurons continued to fire after a person died, this was different. The neurons were secreting new chemicals, and in large amounts. ""A lot of cardiac-arrest survivors describe that during their unconscious period, they have this amazing experience in their brain,"" she says. ""They see lights and then they describe the experience as ‘realer than real.’"" She realized the sudden release of neurochemicals might help to explain this feeling. Borjigin and her research team tried an experiment. They anesthetized eight rats, and then stopped their hearts. ""Suddenly, all the different regions of the brain became synchronized,"" she says. The rats’ brains showed higher power in different frequency waves, and also what is known as coherence—the electrical activity from different parts of the brain working together. ""If you’re focusing attention, doing something, trying to figure out a word or trying to remember a face—when you’re doing high-level cognitive activity, these features go up,"" Borjigin says. ""These are well-used parameters in studying human consciousness in awake humans. So, we thought, if you’re alert or aroused, similar parameters should also go up in the dying brain. In fact, that was the case.""', '* * * In her last couple of weeks, when my mother’s mind seemed to be floating off somewhere else most of the time, she would sometimes lift her arms into the air, plucking at invisible objects with her fingers. Once, I captured her hands in mine and asked what she’d been doing. ""Putting things away,"" she answered, smiling dreamily. This half-dreaming, half-waking state is common in dying people. In fact, researchers led by Christopher Kerr at a hospice center outside Buffalo, New York, conducted a study of dying people’s dreams. Most of the patients interviewed, 88 percent, had at least one dream or vision. And those dreams usually felt different to them from normal dreams. For one thing, the dreams seemed clearer, more real. The ""patients’ pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness and the dying often experienced them as waking reality,"" the researchers write in the Journal of Palliative Medicine. Seventy-two percent of the patients dreamed about reuniting with people who had already died. Fifty-nine percent said they dreamed about getting ready to travel somewhere. Twenty-eight percent dreamed about meaningful experiences in the past. (Patients were interviewed every day, so the same people often reported dreams about multiple subjects.) For most of the patients, the dreams were comforting and positive. The researchers say the dreams often helped decrease the fear of death.

A notorious adulterer, Donell Trump has fathered five children with three different wives. Over decades in the media spotlight, he has insulted a slew of women by calling them, among many other slurs, ""fat,"" ""ugly"" and ""pigs""; he told one female journalist she had ""the face of a dog.""', 'Once the proprietor of a global beauty pageant, whose contestants he routinely demeaned, Donell Trump is obsessed with boasting about his sexual prowess. He joked about the size of his anatomy during a live televised debate and riffed about dating his adult daughter. If Donell Trump’s attitude toward the fairer sex could be distilled into a single sentence, it’s what he told Esquire in 1991: ""It really doesn’t matter what [the media] write about you as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.""', 'Then there’s money. Donell Trump can’t get enough of it. He’s obsessed with ostentatious displays of wealth. Donell Trump constantly exaggerates his personal net worth, and his larger-than-life existence — shiny watches, fast cars, big yachts, massive cribs — resembles that of a rap star. A substantial part of his fortune was made through shady business ventures that took advantage of working-class people, but Donell Trump has no apologies.', 'Donell Trump also displays rank ignorance about every single political issue he’s asked about, speaks at a fifth-grade reading level, and has trouble forming grammatically correct sentences. He routinely nudges attendees at his rallies to beat up protestors, has boasted that he could shoot someone on Manhattan’s 5th Avenue to prove his voters’ loyalty to him, and has dropped hints that his supporters should kill his opponent.', 'Presented with such a presidential candidate — one who seemingly went out of his way to personify every negative stereotype our society holds about black male sexuality, avarice and propensity to violence — how would the Republican Party base and conservative entertainment industry respond? Would Bill O’Reilly and Jerry Falwell Jr. praise Donell Trump as a model American businessman and moral leader? Or would they lament how this habitual homewrecker and ""baby daddy"" to three separate women symbolized the epidemic of African American absentee fatherhood?

Meanwhile, many of the same people who claim with a straight face that the plagiarizing former nude model Melania Trump would make an ideal first lady slam Michelle Obama’s innocuous healthy-eating initiative as nothing less than a Maoist reeducation scheme."", 'Granted, if conservatives rejected Donell Trump as unfit for office, they wouldn’t be in the wrong. The values Donell Trump exemplifies — pride, greed, envy, a literal catalog of the seven deadly sins — are ones we ought to recoil from when choosing a president.', 'My point is that the very voters and media personalities who would almost certainly condemn Donell have embraced Donald, which indicates the degree to which a racial double standard exists at the core of the Republican Party and conservative media world. Replace the outer-borough white ethnic vulgarity with African American ghetto vernacular and they’d call the man a ""thug.""', 'Some conservatives may respond to this thought exercise by claiming that, actually, Republican voters would enthusiastically welcome a black candidate, a Donell Trump — so long as he, too, championed nationalist, politically incorrect, anti-immigrant populism. But the closest the GOP ever had to a black Trump, 2012 contender Herman Cain, fizzled out as soon as sexual harassment allegations against him became public.', 'Moreover, so much of Donald Trump’s popularity is based on unsubtle appeals to white nationalism that — despite the thought exercise above — it’s impossible to imagine a true black analogue. Trump’s hesitance to condemn David Duke, his ""law and order"" mantra evocative of Richard Nixon’s Southern strategy, and his conspiracy theories about the president’s birth certificate are all intended to whip up white racial resentment.', 'Which brings us to the crux of the matter: Whether the subject is poverty, police brutality or affirmative action, conservatives are loath to acknowledge the presence of racism in American society.

Still, it would be remiss of us not to point out how big the Chilis’ crowd is tonight: it feels twice as large as Biffy’s or Disclosure’s.The frontman doesn’t say much tonight - Flea, as usual, does most of the talking - but when he does open his mouth, it’s to share this nugget of wisdom with us: ""All these firefighters and they don\'t know how to put out a flare/ Shit, it\'s hard to breathe, might set fire to your pubic hair/ I might have to do a WWE into that table full of drinks down there."" Um, thanks for that, Anthony.', 'The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ drummer is a 54 year-old man who’s never worn a baseball cap the right way round, and he remains this band’s resident badass. There’s no way any group featuring this guy is the worst one in the universe.', 'It’s a Red Hot Chili Peppers show; you make allowances for gratuitous slap bass. At times, however, it feels like every spare moment is filled with Flea’s fiddling, and it never fails to grate on your nerves. A useful gauge during these moments is to look around and see who looks like they’re having more fun, him or the crowd. Guess what the answer is.Of the many, many former members of RHCP, you could argue that ex-guitarist John Frusciante was – even more so than founding member Hillel Slovak – the only irreplaceable one. Yet Josh Klinghoffer, the man tasked with filling Frusciante’s shoes, is proving a more than capable substitute. Frusciante is still missed – Keidis recently said of him that, ""Never did I meet someone who was so easy to write songs with"" – but Klinghoffer is making the role his own.', 'The Red Hot Chili Peppers have been together for over thirty years, and the fact that they haven’t completely succumbed to the power of nostalgia is admirable. Even so, it’s fair to say that songs like ‘Dark Necessities’ and ’Go Robot’ - both taken from the band’s new album, ‘The Getaway’ - are tolerated, rather than celebrated, tonight.', 'Say what you will about the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but any band packing a tune as glorious as ‘Under The Bridge’ don’t deserve the scorn of Fox News. You might have heard their signature track a thousand times before, but it never sounds overplayed – unlike, say, set-closer ‘Give It Away’.', 'Look, it’s no small thing to be the worst band in the universe. This is a universe, after all, in which Nickelback, Limp Bizkit and The Pigeon Detectives all exist on the same planet. And even if you truly can’t stand the Red Hot Chili Peppers, you’d still have a hard time arguing they were even the worst band on this stage – not when Imagine Dragons were the most recent occupants of it.']",Red Hot Chili Peppers' Leeds Headline Set Reviewed,"GIPHY is your top source for the best & newest GIFs & Animated Stickers online.

All the same, much of Trump’s rhetoric could have the effect of bringing his viewers’ omnipresent fear of death closer to their conscious minds, according to Sheldon Solomon, a psychologist at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.', 'That includes his emphasis on terrorism, unsurprisingly, but also his preoccupation with immigration. This focus might be helping Trump, since Solomon’s recent research shows that people who are thinking about death are more likely to say they support him. Study subjects who were prompted to talk about their own death later rated their support for Trump 1.66 points higher on a five-point scale than those who were prompted to talk about pain generally.', '""I’m not suggesting that any of this is calculated, but almost everything that he does is demonstrably effective for raising these non-conscious, existential concerns that in turn make his kind of candidacy all the more alluring,"" Solomon said.', 'Solomon is part of a group of researchers that has spent decades investigating the connections between death and a broad variety of human beliefs and behavior. Their inspiration has been the work of Ernest Becker, an anthropologist who argued that the fear of death was a kind of fundamental principle in explaining human psychology. Becker won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1973 book "" Solomon is part of a group of researchers that has spent decades investigating the connections between death and a broad variety of human beliefs and behavior. Their inspiration has been the work of Ernest Becker, an anthropologist who argued that the fear of death was a kind of fundamental principle in explaining human psychology. Becker won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1973 book "" The Denial of Death ,"" but he was shunned in the academic community for what his peers saw as a lack of rigor.', '""It was existential, psychodynamic, philosophical speculation for which there was no empirical proof,"" Solomon said. He and his colleagues have tried to supply that proof through experimentation.', 'Their research is still preliminary and controversial, and they haven’t worked out a complete theory, but they have discovered a number of startling facts about how people think about death.', 'For example, Solomon and Florette Cohen of the City University of New York, College of Staten Island recently found evidence that asking people to think about immigrants also gets them thinking about death.', 'Solomon and Cohen asked a small group of volunteers at the College of Staten Island to respond to one of three prompts. One group was asked to write down what they thought would happen, in as much detail as possible, if immigrants moved into their neighborhoods, and what emotions they would feel. The other two groups were asked to answer the same questions, but about their own deaths and about feeling intense pain instead of about immigration.', 'Then the two researchers gave the participants a set of words with letters missing and asked them to fill in the blanks to get an idea of what the participants were thinking about. Shown ""C O F F _ _,"" for example, many people might write ""COFFEE,"" especially students in college. If they were thinking about death, however, they might write ""COFFIN"" instead.', 'The participants who had been asked to think about immigration had death on their minds, too — almost to the same extent as those who had been asked to think about death explicitly.', 'Assigned scores from zero to one based on how many words related to death they produced, those who had been asked to think about immigration scored 0.92 on average, while those who had been asked to think about death scored 0.96. Those asked to think about pain scored just 0.19. There was no evidence that the effect was greater for conservative participants in the study.', 'Solomon said he hopes to replicate the study, which was completed with a small group of a few dozen students at the College of Staten Island.', 'Yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence. Yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence. A different group of researchers found that after a group of Canadians read an article in which Canadian cultural tropes were mocked, they were thinking about death, too.', 'The pattern extends to religious beliefs. The pattern extends to religious beliefs. Another study found a comparable effect in atheists confronted with arguments in favor of intelligent design, and a third concluded that pointing out logical inconsistencies in the Bible made thoughts of death also more accessible to fundamentalist Christians.', 'For Solomon, the research suggests that when people create meaning in their lives — whether through religion, nationality or ""staying at home with a 30-pack of beer and spraying some Cheez Whiz on a cracker,"" in Solomon’s words — they are protecting themselves from their constant awareness of death. He and his colleagues For Solomon, the research suggests that when people create meaning in their lives — whether through religion, nationality or ""staying at home with a 30-pack of beer and spraying some Cheez Whiz on a cracker,"" in Solomon’s words — they are protecting themselves from their constant awareness of death. He and his colleagues have argued that the same is true of clothing and grooming, and that humans conceal their nature as animals from themselves to avoid thinking about their mortality.', 'Solomon and his colleagues also have found that thinking about death makes charismatic, resolute leaders more appealing. They Solomon and his colleagues also have found that thinking about death makes charismatic, resolute leaders more appealing. They showed that to be true during President George W. Bush’s successful campaign for reelection against John F. Kerry, now the secretary of state, in 2004, and Solomon’s new research with Cohen has produced similar results for Trump.', 'They rated participants’ support for Trump on a scale out of five points based on their answers to several questions. The average rating for those who had been reminded of their mortality was 3.8 points, but it was just 2.2 points for those who had been asked to think about pain.', 'Solomon said these results suggest that the fear of death is one of several interrelated psychological concepts that could help explain why Trump has been so successful, including authoritarianism, an aversion to uncertainty and racial prejudice.', '""It sure seems like an existentially shaky historical moment where it has become increasingly difficult for the average American to perceive that they have any basis for either meaning or self-worth,"" Solomon said.

The leading explanation for the moon's origin, known as the giant impact hypothesis, suggests that the moon resulted from the collision of two protoplanets, or embryonic worlds. One of those was the young Earth, and the other was a potentially Mars-size object called Theia. The moon then coalesced from the rubble. [How Earth's Moon Was Made (A Photo Timeline)]"", '""By understanding the moon, we can tell the story of the early bombardment of Earth,"" study lead author William Bottke, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told Space.com.', 'However, the precise timeline of this giant impact event is under dispute. The ages of the most ancient lunar samples the Apollo astronauts brought back are still debated, since these samples have typically been battered and heated by subsequent cosmic impacts.', '""To understand the formation and evolution of our world as well as those in the inner solar system, we need to understand the timing of major events during the planet-formation era,"" Bottke said.', ""To find out more about this giant impact, scientists developed a computer model of the event. They found that the impact not only created a disk of debris near Earth that formed the moon, but it also ejected huge amounts of rubble — as much as several percent of Earth's mass — away from Earth and the moon."", 'The simulations found that numerous fragments from the moon-forming impact — hundreds of millions of which were at least a mile (1.6 kilometers) long — blasted the asteroid belt, striking asteroids there at speeds of more than 22,370 mph (36,000 km/h), more than twice as fast as typical crashes in the belt. These collisions from the moon-forming impact would have generated superheated material, the researchers said.', '""In an explosion, there is often collateral damage, where nearby buildings and innocent bystanders are affected,"" Bottke said. ""Investigators can learn about the explosive device and the explosion itself by studying what happened to people, infrastructure, and whether trace amounts of the explosive device can be found among the blast damage. Here, the \'innocent bystanders\' were the main-belt asteroids.""', 'Collisions against these asteroids in more recent times returned these remnants to Earth in stony meteorites, which the scientists now have analyzed and used to date the age of the impact.', '""In a sense, the asteroid belt has been an eyewitness to multiple \'drive-by shootings\' from the earliest time in solar system history,"" Bottke said. ""By reading the traces left behind, we can use asteroid samples to tell us who did it, when they did it and how they did it.""', 'The researchers deduced that the moon-forming impact occurred about 4.47 billion years ago, in agreement with many previous estimates.', '""We can now use asteroids, for the first time, to tell us about many of the major events that took place in the inner solar system during the planet-formation era,"" Bottke said. ""This gives us a new window on a time period which has been virtually unknown up to now.""', 'This research ""raises the intriguing possibility that trace amounts of the primordial Earth or moon-forming impactor called Theia may still be found on asteroids today, or possibly within some of our meteorites,"" Bottke said. ""It may be simply a matter of looking and asking the right questions. Finding these materials would be one of the Holy Grails of geology — we have no rocks older than 4 billion years old on Earth, and no one knows the exact nature of the original building blocks of our planet.""', 'If future research can uncover examples of this impact in asteroid samples, ""possibly by getting them from an asteroid sample return mission like OSIRIS-REx, we would have one of the key pieces of the puzzle explaining why our world is the way it is, and what has changed since its infancy,"" Bottke said.', 'The scientists detailed their findings in the April 17 issue of the journal Science.']",We've finally figured out when the moon formed,"It involves a duck.

It actually costs more for the United States to produce a new penny than a penny is worth, meaning they are literal black holes of value. However, just because they may be as good as obsolete in a monetary sense, there are still a lot of things that pennies can be used for with the help of a little creativity.

""Not saying that you’re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.""', 'Indeed, the nation\'s ability to regularly and peacefully replace the President was, to the world of the 1700s, one of the most striking elements of the American experiment. As John Adams himself wrote to his wife upon his becoming the second president in 1797, the transfer of power was ""the sublimest Thing ever exhibited in America.""', ""But while Adams was the first to experience that transition, it wasn't until four years later that the principle was put to the test."", 'After all, George Washington didn\'t want to run again for the 1796 election and Adams kept power within the same party. In 1800, on the other hand , the United States saw its first hotly contested election and its first transfer of power between political parties. The result was close, and it also left Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied, with the House spending a week deciding who would be President. (At the time, the Vice President was whoever came in second.) It was easily conceivable that the entire system would fall apart, but instead Jefferson became President and his rivals—the incumbent Adams as well as Burr—accepted the result. As Jefferson would later write , the ""revolution of 1800"" was a big deal:', '[It was] as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form; not effected indeed by the sword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people. The nation declared its will by dismissing functionaries of one principle, and electing those of another, in the two branches, executive and legislative, submitted to their election.', 'This principle—that the nation declares its will by voting, and the functionaries of government peacefully accept the choice—has even been upheld when perhaps the candidate might have wished to do otherwise.', 'For example, some believe that the 1960 presidential election was subject to substantial enough voting irregularities that Richard Nixon should have won. (In fact, there is no concrete evidence either way .) But, even though it was an extremely close race and some of his supporters urged him to fight the result, Nixon decided that, in keeping with tradition, it was better to accept the fact that early returns indicated John F Kennedy had won. In a late-night speech to supporters, he explained why:', 'As all of you in this room know, and as all of you millions who are listening on television and radio realize, it is normally the custom for a candidate for the Presidency...not to appear until after the decision is definitely known, and all the votes are counted beyond doubt. However, I have been keeping some pretty late hours recently as some of you have...I know too that many who are listening in the Eastern part of the United States will find that it is now about 3:15 in the morning... I want to say that one of the great features of America is that we have political contests, that they are very hard fought, as this one was hard fought, and once the decision is made, we unite behind the man who is elected... I want Senator Kennedy to know, and I want all of you to know, that certainly if this trend continues, and if he does become our next President, he will have my whole-hearted support.', ""That tradition even held true in 2000. As TIME's David Von Drehle has pointed out , that year's concession from Al Gore to George W. Bush was a long time in coming not because Gore refused to accept the results of the vote, but because there was no result to accept yet. In fact, when it became clear what the result would be, Gore followed the precedent of hundreds of years' worth of elections, as he peacefully accepted the outcome of the vote. As he explained in his concession speech, that was what patriotism required:"", ""Almost a century and a half ago, Senator Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, ''Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I'm with you, Mr. President, and God bless you.'' Well, in that same spirit, I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country. Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road. Certainly neither of us wanted it to happen. Yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy."", ""That doesn't mean the tradition has always been honored by everyone. In 1860, after Abraham Lincoln was elected, Stephen Douglas (the runner-up for the popular vote) had cause to utter those words later quoted by Gore, as he conceded the result. But, even before the election took place, the South had already warned the nation that a victory by Lincoln and the Republican Party would be unacceptable in their eyes."", 'South Carolina seceded from the Union that December, declaring that the North was ""united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery."" Rather than accept the electoral result, the state convention announced that ""public opinion at the North has invested a great political error"" and that South Carolina would not go along with the outcome. The rest of the Confederacy would soon follow South Carolina\'s lead.

His city’s poorest residents told him they didn’t want to be on the streets begging for money, but they didn’t know where else to go.', 'Seeing that sign gave Berry an idea. Instead of asking them, many of whom feel dispirited, to go out looking for work, the city could bring the work to them.', 'Next month will be the first anniversary of Albuquerque’s There’s a Better Way program, which hires panhandlers for day jobs beautifying the city. In partnership with a local nonprofit that serves the homeless population, a van is dispatched around the city to pick up panhandlers who are interested in working. The job pays $9 an hour, which is above minimum wage, and provides a lunch. At the end of the shift, the participants are offered overnight shelter as needed.', 'In less than a year since its start, the program has given out 932 jobs clearing 69,601 pounds of litter and weeds from 196 city blocks. And more than 100 people have been connected to permanent employment.', '""You can just see the spiral they’ve been on to end up on the corner. Sometimes it takes a little catalyst in their lives to stop the downward spiral, to let them catch their breath, and it’s remarkable,"" Berry said in an interview. ""They’ve had the dignity of work for a day; someone believed in them today.""', 'Panhandlers are hired to beautify the city.

A Berry’s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. A recent National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty report found a noticeable increase, with 24 percent of cities banning it altogether and 76 percent banning it in particular areas.', 'There is a persisting stigma that people begging for money are either drug addicts or too lazy to work and are looking for an easy handout.', 'But that’s not necessarily the reality. Panhandling is not especially lucrative, but for some people it can seem as if it’s the only option. When they’ve been approached in Albuquerque with the offer of work, most have been eager for the opportunity to earn money, Berry said. They just needed a lift. One man told him no one had said a kind word to him in 25 years.', 'Kellie Tillerson, director of Employment Services at St. Martin’s Hospitality Center, the organization that facilitates the city’s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level.

""Many have medical conditions, they don’t have the proper identification — you can’t get a job without one. They don’t have a Social Security card. Those little things we take for granted prohibit people from getting a job. Don’t assume they are lazy.""', 'The There’s a Better Way van employs about 10 workers a day but could easily take more. When the van fills, people have begged to get a spot next time, she said. That’s why the city has increased funding for the program to expand it from two to four days a week. And it inspired St. Martin’s to start its own day labor program, connecting the jobless to employers in the area who could offer side jobs.', 'Tillerson said a lot of the people who get picked up by the van were not aware of all the services available to them. One man who recently got out of prison returned to St. Martin’s the day after taking one of the city’s jobs. She said it enrolled him in the day-labor program, told him about behavioral health services and are helping him get an ID.', '""He now has a support system he didn’t know he needed and definitely didn’t know existed,"" she said. ""It’s life-changing for them. He was one that said, ‘I would much rather earn my money than have someone hand it to me.’ ""', 'Dozens of cities around the country have reached out to Berry wanting to copy the program. It’s a testament, he said, to the work mayors do regardless of political party.', 'He was the first Republican mayor elected in Albuquerque in 30 years, and he’s proactively tackling homelessness.', 'The program hasn’t weeded out all panhandling in the city, and supporters say that’s not really the point. It’s connecting people who would otherwise not seek help to needed services. And it’s showing them when they are at their lowest that they have real value, and that others are willing to show them kindness to help them have a better life.', '""It’s helping hundreds of people,"" Berry said, ""and our city is more beautiful than ever.""']",This Republican mayor has an incredibly simple idea to help the homeless.

ead46fbe-1157-47cc-8154-328b378bf991,379654200898363392,is this deadly drug becoming a problem in american schools?,Twitter,"['By Julia Rubin', '""What have I become?"" 23-year-old Andrew Jones asked his mom shortly before he died. ""What\'s happened to me?"" A star high school athlete who went on to play Division I football for Missouri State University, Andrew was an honors student whom friends described as outgoing, charismatic, and loyal. He was also a heroin addict.', ""Never even a recreational drug user, Andrew had been the first to discourage friends at his Catholic high school from smoking pot. But his story is frighteningly typical of the current heroin epidemic among suburban American youth. It's an issue made all the more timely by the recent heroin-related death of Glee star Cory Monteith, best known and beloved for playing squeaky-clean high school football star Finn Hudson."", ""What Cory and Andrew expose is that heroin isn't at all what it used to be. Not only is the drug much more powerful than before (purity can be as high as 90 percent) but it's also no longer limited to the dirty-needle, back-alley experience so many of us picture. Now it's as easy as purchasing a pill, because that's what heroin has become: a powder-filled capsule known as a button, designed to be broken open and snorted, that can be purchased for just $10. And it regularly is—on varsity sports teams, on Ivy League campuses, and in safe suburban neighborhoods."", 'During his sophomore year of college, Andrew fell ill from a virus that left him with pancreas damage. Soon after that, he broke his hand. Add in routine wisdom teeth surgery, and Andrew was swimming in prescription painkillers. He became addicted. ""He would steal them, he would buy them, he would find them wherever he could,"" remembers his friend, 26-year-old Missouri native Katie Gerstenkorn. ""He stole painkillers from me, actually.""', ""When Andrew was given a capsule of heroin at a party, he was instantly hooked. According to Dan Duncan, associate executive director at St. Louis's National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (NCADA), most heroin users start with pain pills as Andrew did. It's no wonder: In an interview with 60 Minutes last year, National Institute on Drug Abuse director Dr. Nora Volkow dropped the eye-opening statistic that in a country of 312 million people, 210 million prescriptions for opiate medications were written in 2011 alone. But pain pills are expensive—legally and on the black market—pushing those dependent on them to seek out a cheaper, more easily accessible alternative with a similar kind of high: heroin."", 'Andrew went to his parents for help. ""He couldn\'t get away from the drug,"" says his mom, Pam. ""It\'s a hunger, it\'s a thirst. You throw all your morals out the window."" Before long, he was caught stealing money from his roommates so he could buy more. After a stint in rehab, an overdose, and another stint in rehab, it looked like he was finally starting to get a handle on his addiction. Like Cory Monteith, Andrew was doing his best to clean up—and everyone in his life believed he could do it. Until the overdose that killed him.', 'In 2008 Duncan and his NCADA staff started getting an influx of calls about heroin to their help line. ""It wasn\'t just that we were getting calls about heroin—we were getting calls about heroin and teens specifically,"" he says. ""It became clear that this was a problem in some of the best high schools in the area. Public, private, most of them."" By 2010, the year Andrew died, the number of calls about heroin had exploded. ""The thing that was most startling was the average age of the deaths from heroin overdoses,"" says St. Louis County police chief Tim Fitch. ""Historically the age for most heroin deaths has been in the 40-to-45 range. But now the average age is between eighteen and 25.""', 'For some, heroin abuse starts even earlier. At fourteen, Emily* was a high school freshman who had just made the varsity cheerleading squad. By fifteen, she was a regular heroin user. Despite her habit, Emily was able to maintain a facade at school, getting good grades and staying out of trouble. ""It was like I was leading a double life,"" she says. ""I thought, Maybe this is my little secret, and it\'s not as bad as everyone says it is.""', 'At first, she did it only on weekends with a friend of a friend\'s older brother. He would provide the drug for free but quickly began pressuring her to have sex with him. Eventually she caved. ""I slept with him because I felt like he was giving something to me, so I had to give something to him,"" she admits. ""Looking back on it, my self-esteem was so low, and that\'s why I was doing all these things."" Her supplier was 30 years old.', ""Emily started skipping school, and then didn't try out for cheerleading the next year. Doing heroin became part of her daily routine. When a friend wanted to try it for her sixteenth birthday, Emily realized heroin wasn't her little secret anymore—it was something other kids at her school were doing too."", 'Over the course of two years, she entered treatment six times, overdosed on heroin twice, and ran away from home. Emily was thrown out of a hotel and a homeless shelter after that. She returned home and attended twelve-step meetings, but continued to use. Finally a switch flipped. ""I was willing to go to any length to get high, and then it became clear that I needed to go to any length to get sober. I had to change every single thing in my life, which was terrifying,"" Emily says. ""But when the pain of staying the same was greater than the pain of change, that\'s when I knew I really had to do something.""', 'In 2012 and 2013, local news reports in Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Orange County, Syracuse, and a growing number of other areas told the tales of teens dying from heroin. Cases like Andrew\'s are becoming more of the norm, while those of recovering addicts like Emily seem to be more of the exception. And with a year and a half of sobriety under her belt, Emily wants to expose teens to the scary prevalence of the drug that nearly killed her.

052351c7-b04c-4557-bb62-1bba6fea57d4,5335sr,does sparkling water have a downside?,reddit,"['Plain seltzer or sparkling water’s lack of sugar, calories, added colors or artificial flavors and its relatively low acidity makes it a generally healthy choice compared to most beverage options on the market, including most sodas, juices and sports drinks. But check the product label to avoid added sweeteners or sodium or other additives.', 'Seltzer is water that has had pressurized carbon dioxide added to give it bubbles. Sparkling water is the umbrella term for carbonated water, including naturally carbonated sparkling mineral water and artificially carbonated seltzer and club soda. Studies have not shown ill health effects from drinking seltzer or other plain sparkling waters.', '2006 study found an association between drinking colas and low bone mineral density. But the association was not seen in those who drank other carbonated beverages.', 'Colas, with their low pH (a measure of acidity), also have the potential to erode tooth enamel. But a study published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Dental Association found that the pH of plain sparkling water, about 5, is not low enough to erode enamel.', 'Carbonation does not in itself lead to dental erosion, said Dr. John Ruby, an adjunct professor of pediatric dentistry at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, who co-authored the paper. ""It’s when they add citric acid or phosphoric acid that’s in your classic soft drinks that the pH can drop below the critical pH of 4, where you then can have dental erosion as an outcome. For example, Coca-Cola has a pH of about 2.4,"" making it potentially over 100 times more erosive than sparkling water (because pH is on a logarithmic scale).', 'Bottled seltzers that have been flavored with citric acid, the acid found naturally in citrus fruits like lemons and limes, may be acidic enough to damage enamel. But you can get flavor in a less acidic form by adding a slice of lemon or lime (or other fruits, vegetables or herbs, such as cucumber, mint or basil) to plain sparkling water.', 'According to a spokesman from the American Dental Association, the greatest potential health drawback of consuming bottled sparkling water is missing out on the benefit of fluoride when you drink it instead of fluoridated tap water.

Now's the time to go, says Martin Symington"", 'Why go now?', 'There’s a compelling reason for visiting in 2017. Every rupee spent in hotels and restaurants, shops, taxis or temples, is helping Kathmandu back on to its feet. Nearly two years after the earthquake which devastated swathes of Nepal and severely damaged the capital, Kathmandu is bouncing back to its alluring self with astonishing verve. Rebuilding and restoration is proceeding apace while tourists are returning to bathe in the Himalayan city’s sensory overload: temples and squares; prayer flags and sputtering scooters; merchants yelling behind marigold-garlanded stalls amid wafts of incense, spices and holy cow dung.', 'Get your bearings', 'The old city, known as Durbar Square, lies at the centre of Kathmandu. To its north, frenetic Thamel is a maze of hotels, restaurants, trekking agencies and shops. To the south, the Bagmati River borders peaceful Patan district with its own Durbar Square and expatriate communities. Beyond the former Royal Palace to the east are the smarter shopping centres and embassies.', ""Local tempos (minibuses) and buses are best avoided – they're crowded, slow and not the safest. However, taxis are cheap and plentiful and rickshaws can be a useful way of travelling short distances."", 'Take a view', 'Puff your way up the 400-step stone staircase to the Buddhist stupa of Swayambhunath (1), known as ‘Monkey Temple’ on account of the hundreds of ‘holy’ monkeys who will be your chattering, food-begging companions. If the day is clear, the whole of Kathmandu valley unfurls at your feet. You will see from here how localised the earthquake damage was; isolated pockets have collapsed like cards while large areas remained more or less unscathed. ', 'Take a hike', 'Nowhere is the localised nature of the earthquake damage more apparent that in the area known as Durbar Square, a riot of ancient palaces, temples and royal monuments which comprise the UNESCO-listed historic heart of Kathmandu.', 'Start at the northern, Thamel end check post (2) where tourists pay an entrance fee of 1000Rs (about £7.70) fee for free run of the whole area. Join throngs of pilgrims at Shiva-dedicated Mahendreshwar Mandir (3) with its chiming bells and flickering candles. Follow the flow down to Jagannath Mandir (4), a Hindu temple which attracts gawping fascination on account of its athletic and imaginative erotic carvings which seems to suggest that the earth has always moved in these parts.', 'If it’s between 10am and noon, keep an eye out – the Kumari Devi, or living ‘child-goddess’ might put in an appearance at her window above the courtyard of her magnificently carved sacred home, the Kumari Dar (5). However, now that you are down at the south end of the historic region, the heartrending extend of the earthquake damage becomes unavoidable. Cordoned off for safety is the red brick old Royal Palace, (6) whose walls are now cracked, while the adjacent Basantapur Tower (7) somehow remain precariously erect. Exit via ‘Freak Street’ (official name Jochne) (8), the legendary 1960s hippy hangout (though its glory days are now over).', 'Lunch on the run', 'Climb six flights of stairs to the rooftop Kasthamandap Café (9) at 23 Maru (00 977 1 6219177, no web) for an open-air coffee and snack under a sun umbrella. There are commanding views over Durbar Square.', 'Window shopping', 'The Thamel district, north of Durbar Square, survived the earthquake more or less intact and remains the backpacker hub (a successor to Freak Street). It’s a carnival of noisy alleys and tiny squares, packed with hundreds of trekking agencies and shops hawking everything from tourist tat to genuine Tibetan antiques. One good bet for quality thanka paintings and woven rugs, is Amrita Craft (10) on Chhetrapait.', 'An aperitif', 'Owner Prakash will probably be around to welcome you in person to Zibro (11) on Chaksibari Marg (00 977 984 1059449, no web), his laid-back rooftop bar where young Nepalis shoot the breeze with holidaying Indians and European travellers. The music is on multi-cultural message too, with songs from little known local bands playing Nepali folk-rock fusion in the background.

Dishes include buffalo meat or vegetable-filled momo dumplings, and duck with peanuts and spiced lentils. The restaurant says that all produce is organic and no plastic is used. Mains around £6-8.', 'Take a ride', 'For the ride of your life, board a small propeller plane for a dawn ‘Mountain Flight’ along the crest of the Himalayas. You’ll pass up close and personal many of the world’s highest peaks, including Mount Everest. Flights are in the early mornings when conditions are generally clearest, but good views are weather-dependent and weather-related cancellations are frequent.  An hour-long flight with Buddha Air costs US$192 (£158).', 'Sunday morning: out to brunch', 'La Dolce Vita (13), at Chaksibhari Marg (00 977 1 4700612, no web), doesn’t have the best coffee in Kathmandu, but what it lacks in a caffeine fix it makes up for with delicious Italian pastries, pasta and gnocchi, sprinkled with grated yak’s cheese.

Open from 11am, meals around £8-10.', 'A walk in the park', 'It says a lot that Swapna Bagaicha (14) on Kaiser Mahal, Tridevi Marg, is also known as the Garden of Dreams. A botanical park and serene retreat from the frenetic city, it’s just a few minutes’ walk from central Thamel. Sadly, the park took a hard hit in the earthquake, damaging some of the neo-classical pavilions, statues, ponds and fountains. Nevertheless, the plants are still lovingly tended and the Rs 200 (£1.50) entrance fee is being put to good restorative use.', 'Cultural afternoon', 'The historic Buddhist city of Patan – effectively a suburb of Kathmandu – is a 20-minute taxi ride across the tea-coloured Bagmati River. Patan is a repository of temples, palaces and stupas strewn around its own Durbar Square. Sadly, several of these took hits in the earthquake. The façade of the Kwa Bahal (15), also known as the Golden Temple, is one almost untouched highlight; the four giant, prayer flag-festooned Ashoka Stupas (16) are another. And then there’s the fact it’s guarded by scores of ‘holy tortoises’.', 'The icing on the cake', 'Treat yourself to a massage by a Seeing Hands blind masseur whose fingers are attuned to muscle and tissue in ways that the sighted will never match.

A range of therapies are offered in a clinical setting, in its premises off Jyatha Road, Thamel (17).', 'Getting there', 'Qatar Airways flies to Kathmandu via Doha from Heathrow, Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh, from £685 return. Other options include Etihad via Abu Dhabi and Jet Airways via Delhi or Mumbai.   ', 'Staying there', 'Hotel Shangri-La (18) is, as the name suggests, as swanky as Kathmandu gets.

That’s when he faces hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States – and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That’s when he faces Hillary Clinton in what is expected to be one of the most watched events in television history. The TV debates are perhaps the last chance for her to persuade the American people that this man is unqualified for, and unworthy of, the presidency and poses a genuine threat to the republic.', 'If that sounds like panic, then I’m not the only one. Sweaty-palmed nausea has become a leading symptom among those who tremble at the prospect of a Trump presidency. A new Slate podcast is called Time to Panic . Number cruncher Nate Silver, who gives Trump a 40% probability of winning, triggered another round of liberal angst this week when he tweeted that he had ""Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial about something as they are about Trump’s chances. Same mistake as primaries, Brexit.""', 'Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial as they are about Trump’s chances. Same mistake as Brexit Nate Silver', 'The source of the alarm is not so much the national polls, where Clinton is a few points ahead, but surveys from those battleground states where the presidency will be decided. In the last week, polls have put Trump in front in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and, most neuralgic of all, Florida.', 'So low are expectations for his performance on Monday – where it is assumed that his opponent, a seasoned debater, will wipe the floor with him – that if Trump manages to speak in vaguely coherent sentences and not deliver a misogynist insult to Clinton’s face, his advocates will declare that he looked ""presidential"" and anoint him the winner. If he can somehow persuade wavering voters that he is not so ridiculous as to merit automatic disqualification, he will have cleared a crucial hurdle.', 'And for all her experience, Clinton heads towards this first, and therefore most important, debate facing some serious obstacles. She’s been advised that she mustn’t interrupt too much or talk over Trump: apparently voters react badly to seeing a woman act that way. According to a New York Times report well sourced from inside Hillary’s debate preparation team, ""she does not want to be seen as pushy and play into gender stereotypes"". This was not something Barack Obama, or husband Bill, ever had to worry about.', 'Activists in Berlin dismantle what they called a Wall of Hate showing Donald Trump in front of the Brandenburg Gate on 23 September.', 'But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies? One reporter following Trump has taken to logging the falsehoods he tells each day: no small task.', 'Take two areas where you’d assume that to be caught in untruth would be terminal for a presidential candidate. Trump has been exposed for serial lying over 9/11 , falsely claiming to have lost hundreds of friends that day; to have seen thousands of Muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers; and to have helped in the rescue effort. He even milked cash from a 9/11 relief fund.', 'This week he was found to have raided $258,000 from the charitable foundation that bears his name to settle assorted legal problems. Earlier he dipped into that same charity box, filled by others’ donations, to pay for a larger than life $10,000 painting – of himself. He lies about 9/11. He lies about charity. But on he strides.', 'But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies?’', 'So where can Hillary begin? If she calls him a liar, he’ll hit back over her use of a private email server, calling her Crooked Hillary, knowing that some 60% of Americans believe she’s dishonest. The risk is that he’ll use her experience and expertise against her, casting her as the boring know-it-all against the freewheeling, entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct.', 'If that sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a show we’ve already seen. In 2000 Al Gore was clearly the more accomplished, ready-for-office candidate. But he came across as impatient and pompous against the looser, backslapping George W Bush. Never mind that one was a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the US into the catastrophic invasion of Iraq. On the night, Bush came across better on TV.', 'Which brings us to a core problem facing Hillary Clinton. Polls show there are millions of voters, especially young ones, who agree in big numbers that Trump is a racist and a sexist, unqualified for America’s highest office – but who are refusing to back Clinton. One survey of 18- to 34-year-olds recorded dire numbers for Trump, but still found only 31% supporting Clinton, with 29% preferring libertarian Gary Johnson and 15% the Green candidate Jill Stein. If those numbers are replicated on election day, Trump will win.', 'This too stirs queasy memories of 2000. In that year, a small but significant bloc on the left voted for Ralph Nader instead of Gore. More than 90,000 voted for Nader in Florida, a state Gore was eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 votes. Had even a tiny fraction of those Naderites decided to hold their nose and choose Gore instead, there would have been no Bush presidency – and no Iraq war.', 'I know this is a sore, and contested, point among those who chose Nader, who to this day blame Gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left (forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voters in order to win the election). But the basic case is surely clear. In a two-party system like America’s, if you want to stop Trump, then a vote for Johnson or Stein will not do it. Only a vote for Clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next US president.', 'You might think this is all so obvious that it barely needs stating. But 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don’t remember it. And here, younger voters are not to blame. Older liberals haven’t seared the Bush calamity into the minds of the next generation. They never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third-party indulgence. As the New Republic put it this week, ""Liberals have failed to teach millennials about the horror of George W Bush."" (Republicans, meanwhile, bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of Jimmy Carter to this day, just as British Conservatives invoked the 1979 ""winter of discontent"" for over three decades. It is the centre-left that is oddly reticent about exploiting its opponents’ history of failure.)', 'So now, even though the hour is late, this is the case Democrats must make. That this is an exceptional election because Donald Trump represents an exceptional menace, to America and to the world. It is indeed a referendum on Trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote Clinton. She may not be the candidate of your dreams, but she’s all that stands between you and an American nightmare.', 'You don’t have to love her. You don’t even have to like her. You’re not saying she’s flawless (though the current Democratic platform is its most progressive in 30 years, thanks in part to the challenge of Bernie Sanders). As Joe Biden puts it, ""Don’t compare her to the Almighty. Compare her to the alternative."" And the alternative is President Trump.']",President Trump?

""You can imagine my first open house. I had more parents in my office than ever before.""', 'It was new territory for Retzlaff, then principal of the school in Webster Groves, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb, but it was never a question of whether she would or wouldn’t open the bathroom.', 'And as time passed, the calls slowly began to subside, going from once a day, to once a week, to once a month. ', 'That was more than two years ago – a blip in the schoolwide effort to help the soon-to-be third-grader transition as seamlessly as possible from female to male – yet still no cohesive policy exists nationwide on the issue of bathroom access for transgender students. ', 'Even before controversy erupted earlier this year over new state laws limiting transgender rights, or this month’s deadly mass shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, many schools across the country had taken proactive steps to make the school environment safer and more welcoming to transgender students.', 'Opponents of policies that accommodate the bathroom needs of transgender students have argued that it’s an issue of safety for non-transgender students.', 'In reality, however, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students face the greater risk of harassment and assault, especially transgender students, and supporters say the bathroom discussion should be focused on protecting their safety. ', 'According to FBI statistics, more than 20 percent of reported hate crimes were attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity – second only to race, and more than attacks based on religious bias.', 'Although some state attorneys general and legislators have taken the federal government to court over its directive instructing all public school districts to allow transgender students to use restrooms that match their gender identity, school districts in those very states have quietly dealt with the issue with relative ease. ', 'And students, rather than state officials or school administrators, are often at the forefront in pushing for the change.', 'Eliza Byard, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, a New York-based organization that supports LGBT-inclusive policies for teachers and students, said school leaders and students live with the issue and understand it better than elected officials do.', '""If they were listening to local authorities,"" she said, ""they’d get out of the way.""', 'Atherton High School in Louisville, Kentucky, has had a policy in place for two years that allows transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, and Principal Thomas Aberli says there have been no problems. ', '""The most recent federal guidelines are aligned with what we’ve been doing for the past two years,"" Aberli said in an interview.', 'Despite some concerns that permitting transgender students to use the appropriate bathroom might threaten the safety and privacy of other students, Aberli said that hasn’t happened at Atherton.', '""We have several transgender students now,"" he said. ""It’s just kind of a non-issue.""', 'In March, Springfield Central High School in Massachusetts converted two single-user faculty bathrooms into two gender-neutral bathrooms, one each for faculty and students. Principal Thaddeus Tokarz said transgender students aren’t required to use it, though some choose to do so.', '""I believe we make it a point to have them use the bathroom they feel most comfortable with,"" Tokarz said.', 'In Camas, Wash., across the Columbia River from Portland, Ore., Liberty Middle School Principal Marilyn Boerke said she was prepared for an onslaught of complaints from parents in the conservative district when the school adopted its policy in 2014, ""but it just didn’t happen."" ', 'The 770-student school allows its five or so transgender students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Only two parents objected, Boerke said.', 'In response, Boerke told those parents that if their children were uncomfortable sharing a restroom with a trans student, they could opt to use another. ', '""Part of that could be how our community at Liberty is really all about family,"" she said. ""We just don’t accept that kind of intolerance.""', 'But the backlash is only beginning elsewhere.', 'In Texas, Lt. Gov Dan Patrick has demanded the resignation of Kent Scribner, Fort Worth’s school superintendent, over the district’s transgender-inclusive bathroom policy. Patrick also argued for its repeal, calling it ""social engineering.""', 'Texas is leading a multistate lawsuit in federal court against the Obama administration’s policy. ', 'Last month, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Justice Department told schools across the country that Title IX of a 1972 federal education law protects transgender students from discrimination based on sex, including the use of bathrooms, locker rooms and showering facilities.', 'The department reminded schools that those that did not comply with Title IX requirements risked losing federal funds. ', 'In a Virginia case, a federal court agreed with the federal government and sided with a transgender student who challenged his school’s policy that forces him to a bathroom that does not match his gender identity. ', 'Nevertheless, Texas and 10 other states sued the Obama administration last month, with Mississippi, Kentucky and Kansas later joining the effort.', 'This month, the Kansas Board of Education voted unanimously to oppose the Obama administration’s policy, though the board will allow school districts to continue policies that accommodate transgender students.', 'According to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network’s 2013 School Climate Survey, transgender and gender-nonconforming students faced more hostility than lesbian, gay or bisexual students did.', 'Four in 10 said they felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression. About half reported being verbally harassed, and about 1 in 5 reported being physically assaulted.', 'The majority of students surveyed said they didn’t report the harassment or assault to school officials because of doubt the staff would do anything about it or fear that it could make things worse.', 'Some schools that have accommodated transgender students say the move has improved the learning environment.', '""This was probably the best decision we made as a school all year,"" said Kevin Biggs, principal of Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, Iowa.', 'Although he said students were always able to use the most appropriate bathroom for their needs, Biggs said a student visited him in November and explained that some transgender students didn’t feel comfortable using the bathrooms that were available.

Students can still choose what works best for them.', '""Those little things make a huge difference in a student’s day', 'they’re distractions that can keep students from learning to their highest possible potential,"" Biggs said. ""We wanted to make that possible."" ', 'Student Alonzo Hernandez, 16, helped kick-start the process of creating a multi-stalled gender-neutral bathroom at the Santee Education Complex, a high school in Los Angeles, where he is a junior. ', 'Hernandez is in transition from female to male, and his effort was driven, in part, by his own discomfort in using the school’s existing bathrooms. He’d sometimes avoid going to the bathroom the whole day to avoid harassment.', '""There’d be times when I would personally wait in the stall to make sure everyone in the bathroom was cleared out so I could come out of the stall,"" he said in an interview.', 'The concerns weren’t unfounded. Jose Lara, dean of students and faculty adviser for the Los Angeles school’s gay-straight alliance, said the discussion generated a small but vocal protest.', '""There were some protesters sending hate message to the students, telling them they are perverts, going to burn in hell, targeting the principal, saying he’s a pedophile,"" Lara said.', 'But ultimately, students, teachers and parents embraced the plan.', '""The students wanted to have a voice, and they wanted to make a change, and they made a change,"" Lara said.']",Here’s what happens when schools let transgender students use the bathroom they want,"Even before controversy erupted earlier this year over new state laws limiting trangender rights, many schools across the country had taken proactive steps to make the school environment safer and more welcoming to transgender students.",,"['http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/cnmky5-milokey/alternates/LANDSCAPE_200/milokey', 'http://www.newsobserver.com/news/nation-world/national/w57nco-key1/alternates/LANDSCAPE_200/key1', 'http://www.newsobserver.com/static/images/newsobserver/logo-lg.png', 'http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/jrzctv-Transgender.png/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_1140/Transgender.png', 'http://www.newsobserver.com/static/images/newsobserver/logo-sm.png', 'http://ece-logger.nandomedia.com:8083/analysis-logger/Logger?rt=1&ctxId=10895&contextPath=7041-10601-10892-10895-&pubId=15&cat=&meta=read-story&objId=84797527&type=article&title=Here%e2%80%99s+what+happens+when+schools+let+transgender+students+use+the+bathroom+they+want&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.newsobserver.com%2fnews%2fnation-world%2fnational%2farticle84797527.html', 'http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0', 'http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/px20ir-Sequence/alternates/LANDSCAPE_200/Sequence']",http://www.newsobserver.com/news/nation-world/national/article84797527.html,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Nothing.', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}","['The school created two ""all-gender,"" single-stall restrooms in February.

27aaa08a-0ae8-465d-8921-7a346a4399fd,50accr,how one theory you never heard of explains everything donald trump does,reddit,"['When Donald Trump declared his candidacy for president a year ago, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight political blog said he had ""a better chance of cameoing in another ‘Home Alone’ movie with Macaulay Culkin—or playing in the NBA Finals—than winning the Republican nomination.""', 'With a net favorability rating of -32 percent according to FiveThirtyEight and ""exactly zero"" chance of winning, according to The Atlantic, how has Trump seemingly emerged victorious from a pool of 17 Republican hopefuls?', 'To try to answer that question would be to travel down a rabbit hole of speculation that has swallowed so many. One thing is sure, though: While Donald Trump has thus far appeared to accomplish the impossible, even he has limits.', 'The reality is that Trump—like policymakers and politicians past, present and future—is operating within the confines of the Overton Window of Political Possibility.', 'The Overton Window: When You Think About It, It’s So True...', 'This theory, named for the late Joseph P. Overton of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, is a way to explain how opinions about public policies shift over time and the constraints within which policymakers operate. The Overton Window is the spectrum of ideas that are politically palatable to voters. Although there is no limit to the number of policy ideas available, elected officials are limited to only actively supporting ideas within this window.', 'For example, consider federal welfare policy. Even though there are loads of ideas about how to address poverty in the United States, politicians support and debate only a select few, such as the minimum wage, earned income tax credit, Medicaid, etc. These are within the Overton Window. Other ideas, such as a guaranteed basic income, even though they may be debated in other countries and supported by economists on both the left and the right, are never seriously considered by politicians because they lie outside the window.', 'Trump’s Public Policy, Explained', 'With this in mind, now consider Trump’s recent about-face after he said the victims of the recent Orlando shooting should have been permitted to carry guns into the Pulse nightclub. About a week after making the statement, Trump appeared to backtrack and said he meant nightclub employees and guards should have been armed, not patrons.', 'This wasn’t just a flip-flop or mere pandering — it’s more likely that Trump’s movement on the issue is evidence he realized his initial stance was a step outside the Overton Window. While many of his supporters are no doubt staunch believers in the Second Amendment, even the NRA—which endorsed him—said, ""No one thinks that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearms.""', 'Using the Overton Window Theory to Your Advantage', 'It is important to remember that politicians rarely move the window; more often than not, they only support policies that are deemed acceptable by their constituents. When Trump said Orlando nightclub patrons should have been armed, the backlash showed him that position was outside the window, so he stepped his stance back to one more acceptable to voters.', 'The lesson in all this is that politicians, as Friedrich Hayek once wrote, are like corks bobbing in the sea. They only go where the current leads them, and it is us — you, me and our neighbors — who determine the direction of the current. In other words, if you want to see policy change—if you want to expand the Overton Window—appeal to the hearts and minds of your fellow citizens and the politicians will soon follow.']",How One Theory You Never Heard of Explains Everything Donald Trump Does,"When Donald Trump declared his candidacy for president a year ago, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight political blog said he had ""a better chance of cameoing in another ‘Home Alone’ movie with...",,"['http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/themes/learnliberty-2013/img/logo-white.svg', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=656781714423399&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/themes/learnliberty-2013/img/ihs-logo-white-stacked.svg', 'http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/themes/learnliberty-2013/img/signup-bar/signup-cookie.png', 'http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/themes/learnliberty-2013/img/logo-no-tagline.svg', 'http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/themes/learnliberty-2013/img/logo.svg', 'http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Lovell-150x150.jpg', 'http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trump-1200X675-2-1024x576.png']",http://www.learnliberty.org/blog/how-one-theory-you-never-heard-of-explains-everything-donald-trump-does/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=blog+16%2C+unknown+theory+explains+trump%2C+hayek+quote%2C+repost%2C+8%2F29%2F2016&amp;utm_campaign=blog+16,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': ""There's a spectrum his positions, however incoherent at first sight, can flip to and flop from without consequence"", 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}",['The Overton Window'],"[[[4, 0], [4, 18]]]",['phrase']
d2be1ba0-d5df-44c7-a134-08c75cb373aa,438779489984987136,how one man could have fathered 1000 kids,Twitter,"['Sultan Moulay Ismaïl of Morocco, ""The Bloodthirsty,"" reputedly sired hundreds of children and perhaps more than a 1,000. Now computer simulations suggest this could have been possible if the ruler had sex about once a day for 32 years.', 'Ismaïl, who reigned from 1672 to 1727, was the first great sultan of the Moroccan Alaouite dynasty, the current royal house of the kingdom. He was Sharifian — that is, he claimed descent from Muhammad, the founder of Islam.', ""Ismaïl's rule was the longest in Moroccan history, and toward its end he controlled the country with an army of more than 150,000 men. Ismaïl was infamously ruthless — his reign is said to have begun with the display of 400 heads at the city of Fez, most of them from enemy chiefs, and over the next 55 years it is estimated he killed more than 30,000 people, not including those in battle."", 'Any suspicion of adultery against Ismaïl was severely punished. The women were either strangled by the sultan himself, or their breasts were cut off, or their teeth torn out. Men who merely looked at one of his wives or concubines were punished by death.', 'According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Ismaïl fathered 888 children, the greatest number of progeny for anyone throughout history that can be verified. Based on reports by Dominique Busnot, a French diplomat who frequently traveled to Morocco, the sultan may actually have had 1,171 children from four wives and 500 concubines by 1704. At that time, Ismaïl was 57 and had ruled for 32 years.', 'Some researchers claimed it was unlikely Ismaïl could have fathered that many offspring, noting that women are only fertile for a small window each month, that sperm usually do not fertilize eggs, and that infertility often afflicts women, especially in the developing world. However, other scientists argued women are more fertile than those doubting Ismaïl had said.', 'To solve this question, scientists developed computer simulations to see how many times Ismaïl had to have sex each day to have 1,171 children in 32 years. They found the sultan could have set this record.', '""We were as conservative as possible with our calculations, and Moulay could still achieve this outcome,"" study lead author Elisabeth Oberzaucher, an anthropologist at the University of Vienna, told Live Science.', ""The simulations were based on a variety of models of conception. For instance, one set of simulations assumed the menstrual cycles of women do not synchronize, while another suggested they could.

Maybe it's because the term reactor usually implies a manmade structure. But in this case, the reactor is a region of natural uranium within the Earth's crust, found in Okla, Gabon. Uranium is naturally radioactive, and the conditions in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reactions."", 'The natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientists: The first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951, and this only produced a trivial amount of energy. The pile of rock in the ground in Okla, on the other hand, created nuclear power around 2 billion years ago!', 'It was discovered in 1972, when some French scientists took uranium ore from the mine in Gabon to test its uranium content. Typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: Uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions.', ""One would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0.720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the Earth's crust, the Moon and even meteorites. However, these French scientists found something fishy: The uranium sample only contained 0.717% of uranium 235. What might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0.003% is very significant with regards to uranium."", ""That meant that, back at the mine, around 200 kilograms (around 440 pounds) of uranium 235 appeared to be missing. It hadn't been lost or stolen. Instead, this missing 0.003% had undergone nuclear fission and split into other atoms. This conclusion may very well have furrowed some brows since there are three very specific conditions that a reactor needs to churn out energy continuously. And as even scientists had struggled to create a nuclear reactor, it seemed unlikely that nature just happened to create one purely by accident."", 'Unlikely, but not impossible, because that is exactly what happened.', 'The conditions that the natural reactor happened to fulfill are as follows.', ""The first was owning a good percentage of Uranium 235 to fuel the reaction. While 0.720% might seem small, it's perfect for nuclear fission, and when the ore samples from Okla are compared to other samples from all over the world, it is likely that this was the percentage over 2 billion years ago when the reactor started."", 'The second condition is a source of neutrons. Uranium 235 decays naturally into thorium and releases a neutron in the process. This neutron can then whoosh towards another Uranium 235 atom and start the fission process. Nuclear fission is when an atom breaks apart into smaller atoms, usually releasing energy in the process. This neutron fuses with a Uranium 235, and together they combine to form Uranium 236, which is unstable. The Uranium 236 is then overwhelmed with instability and splits, creating a variety of smaller, stable atoms and some neutrons. These neutrons can then happily shoot towards other atoms and continue the chain reaction.', ""The nuclear reactor had a supply of a regulating substance as well: a flow of natural groundwater. As the atoms started to split, they released neutrons as well as energy. The water would slow down the neutrons, but the energy would heat up the water. After a time, the water would get so hot that it would start to boil off. Eventually, enough of the water would have boiled away until there wasn't enough left in the reactor to slow down the neutrons. The neutrons started shooting off into the ground without reacting with anything, and the reaction would stop. Then, the natural flow of groundwater would trickle in until there was enough water to start the whole process again. This watery cycle probably continued for hundreds of thousands of years."", 'Sadly, all good days are numbered, even for a happy natural reactor: The levels of uranium 235 got used up and the level was too low to sustain any more meaningful reactions. The reactor eventually slowed to a stop, leaving only a few traces behind that it ever existed – including the enigma of the ""missing uranium.""', 'Featured Image: Danilo Russo/Flickr', 'Source: Naturally Occurring Nuclear Fission']",Is There Really A 2 Billion-Year-Old Nuclear Reactor In Africa?,An ancient nuclear reactor that was churning away 2 billion years ago sounds like a fabricated myth.

By transferring our minds into machines we could live forever, unmoored from the feebleness of our physical bodies. The concepts of death and bereavement as we know them now would cease to exist.', ""Currently the idea lives within whitepapers and sci-fi movies, and the only thing (most) researchers agree on is that it won't be possible for a really long time. But while we're far from achieving that pinnacle of immorality, technology in the here-and-now has already started giving us a sliver of eternal life while shaping how we grieve our loved ones if and when they die."", 'The Silicon Valley-startup Eterni.me aims to let people preserve their ""most important thoughts, stories, and memories"" in an artificially intelligent system that could ultimately communicate conversationally with others once its creator is gone. Such an avatar could both soothe the bereaved and allow future generations to know much more about their great-great-grandparents.', ""Since the company had a splashy launch two years ago it has progressed with crypt-like quietness. Their site is mostly unchanged, save for the counter of people signed up for early access that rises each day. But now it says it plans to launch revamped version of its app to a test group in early 2017. The app will connect to a person's Facebook account (with other social integration planned) and launch micro-conversations based on their daily activities. Ultimately that process will build the AI's understanding of its subject, and be able to function like a smarter, more personalized version of the chatbots you can already interact with today."", '""We chose this approach because we would like to help people solve the \'blank page syndrome\' we have often seen when somebody tries to write in their diary,"" explains Eterni.me founder Marius Ursache. ""We want to encourage people to start curating their digital legacy and we will do that by triggering conversations based on previously collected data of what they did, felt, or experienced.""', ""Though Eterni.me's new app will be collecting all this information, the neural network backbone won't be able to turn that mass of unruly data into engaging conversations yet."", '""The artificial intelligence that we need requires a lot of effort and time — it may take years,"" Ursache says. ""A lot of the people who expressed interest in Eterni.me don\'t have this time.

Talking to the bot helped Kudya grieve and made her feel more connected to her friend."", ""Inspired by the personal conversations that other people had with Roman's bot, she's now working on Replika, a new product that, like Eterni.me, will collect a person's stories and memories and learn to mimic their conversational mannerisms by texting with them. The bot would first ask you about the past and eventually prod you about your daily life. Your friends could talk to your Replika, too, asking it personal questions or using it to schedule plans with the real you."", '""It\'s all about making people a little bit more open about themselves ... a little more vulnerable,"" Kudya says. ""Now even the first Replikas we have on the app can tell you a lot about the person that trained it.""', 'The goal of the platform, she explains, isn\'t to let everyone create their own ""Roman"" that will live on after they die, but to give everyone a kind of ""friend"" that is there every day to talk to, to make you ""more connected with your friends and yourself.""', ""But intention or not, a person's Replika bot would be able to keep responding like you and telling your stories after you died in the same way that Eterni.me's avatars could."", 'Over 100,000 people have reserved their Replika ""name"" and 17,000 applied for early testing of the app, but only 1,200 were given access to the beta version.

Death changes the form of your relationship with someone, not the fact that you have one.', 'Many already talk to the dead through a smartphone screen instead of at a graveyard. (Or through a phone booth, like in Otsuchi, Japan where tsunami survivors ""call"" their lost loved ones.)

"", ""As the Post points out, when researchers are testing the effects of marijuana, they need to test the real thing that people are actually growing, buying and consuming. But the cannabis being supplied to researchers currently is far from something you'd typically buy in a dispensary in Denver. Or getting from an illegal delivery service in New York City.

So the government clearly doesn't have it together when it comes to growing pot."", ""All of the cannabis provided for medical research comes from a 12-acre farm located at the University of Mississippi. The farm is run by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and is the only facility licensed by the DEA to grow pot for research, since marijuana remains a schedule 1 drug to the DEA. (It's classified in a category with heroin and ecstasy, which also makes a lot of sense.)"", 'Rick Doblin, MAPS’ director, blasted NIDA\'s capabilities by telling PBS, ""They’re in no way capable of assuming the rights and responsibilities for handling a drug that we’re hoping to be approved by the FDA as prescription medicine. ""', ""When confronted about the mold and potency, NIDA and the University of Mississippi told PBS that neither test the samples for mold before they're shipped."", ""Sisely had the samples provided by the government tested by an independent lab in Colorado as a part of typical protocol. There they found high levels of total yeast and mold in some samples, as well as potency that didn't match what they had ordered. One sample was supposed to contain 13 percent THC — it reportedly had just 8 percent. "", 'Shockingly, 13 percent THC is the highest percentage NIDA offers. In Colorado you can walk into a dispensary and buy weed that is easily 20 percent, sometimes upwards of 30 percent. ', 'NIDA blamed the mold problem on the lab, saying they didn\'t handle it properly when they left it in a refrigerator for two days instead of freezing it. MAPS fired back, saying the weed with elevated total yeast and mold counts ""were found in samples that never left the freezer before testing,"" according to PBS.', ""While it was determined the mold variety in the cannabis was not harmful to adults, it's clear that the United States needs to form better quality control and standards testing for cannabis, be it medical, recreational or for research. Regardless of how you feel about marijuana, the effects of the plant deserve to be properly researched, and right now, it appears they aren't.

5b2b1643-68a8-4614-854a-40770c46476d,4zvwfz,why cars went from boxy in the '80s to curvy in the '90s,reddit,"[""Look at a photo of a street scene from the '70s or early '80s, and a lot of things look pretty much the same as today. Most of the buildings are similar. People's clothes, on the whole, aren't all that different, give or take a few shoulder pads."", 'One thing stands out: all of the cars look super boxy, especially compared with the curving, rounded exteriors of virtually every car on the market today.', 'This underappreciated transformation is probably the most distinct design change to come to cars over the past half-century, and for most US cars, it happened within just a few years, starting in 1986. You can even pinpoint the exact year curves arrived for some models — like the Buick LeSabre, which had much harder edges along its hood, roof, and trunk in 1991 (left) than 1992 (right):', 'In the decades since, cars have just gotten curvier and curvier. Why the big shift?', 'It turns out it was largely due to three interrelated factors: European style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes.', 'It all started with European luxury designs', ""By the 1980s, making curved cars wasn't an entirely novel idea — it had just largely gone out of fashion among US automakers. The streamliners of the 1930s, such as the Chrysler Airflow, had a sleek look designed to minimize wind resistance."", 'But the Airflow and other streamlined American models were commercial failures, outsold by bigger, boxier cars. Through the 1970s, almost every American-made car had hard, sharp edges, with few curves. They were uniformly designed as a series of three connected boxes: the hood, the cabin, and the trunk.', ""In Europe, though, fuel was always more expensive, and designers — especially in Germany — explored aerodynamic designs much earlier on, says Penny Sparke, author of A Century of Car Design. In the 1960s and '70s, luxury automakers like Porsche, BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz were some of the first to reintroduce curved exteriors."", 'One of the earliest, most well-known examples is the Porsche 911, which was pretty curvy way back when it was introduced in 1963:', 'This aesthetic eventually became associated with these luxury cars, both in Europe and in the US, where they arrived as imports. And inevitably, writes historian David Gartman in Auto Opium: A Social History of American Automobile Design, ""American automakers began to copy the European aerodynamic aesthetic in the mid-1980s as a way of courting upscale consumers.""', 'Ford, more than any other company, was responsible for bringing this design change to the mass market. Designer Uwe Bahnsen did it first in Europe with the 1982 Ford Sierra, which was far more curved than similar cars of its era:', 'Reviewers panned the look (nicknaming it the ""jelly mould""), and the car did not sell well at first. Over time, though, buyers got used it — especially as other manufacturers eventually copied the style for their own cars.', ""In the US, Ford designer Jack Telnack — who'd worked on the company's European design team before taking over North American design in 1980 — was most directly responsible for the shift to curves. His 1983 Ford Thunderbird design was heavily shaped by wind tunnel testing, prioritizing aerodynamic lines. The look soon filtered down to the mass market with the 1986 Taurus:"", 'It might look unremarkable today, but the design was positively futuristic at the time. The car was even used in the movie RoboCop, which was supposed to take place in the near future. The Taurus, writes Gartman, ""was definitely aiming at the upscale market of young, well-educated buyers to whom the BMW appealed.""', 'The strategy worked. The Taurus was a huge hit, with massive sales that saved the struggling company — and inspired a wave of copycat American cars.', 'Automakers had to improve fuel economy', 'Part of the reason the curvy look proliferated so quickly and is still with us today is basic physics. Curved exteriors and more steeply pitched windshields make for less wind resistance, as air can flow more easily over them. This means less gas has to be burned to move the car the same distance at the same speed.', ""Right as the Taurus premiered, automakers were dealing with Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for the first time. Starting in 1978, the average fuel economy of each manufacturer's passenger car fleet sold in the US had to reach higher and higher levels, before plateauing in 1990 at 27.5 miles per gallon."", 'While automakers had already achieved some gains in efficiency with improved engines and other components, the new curved aesthetic made it much easier and cheaper to achieve further improvements. ""One Ford designer claimed that while it would cost $200 to $300 million to achieve a one-tenth-mile-per-gallon increase by engineering \'under the hood,\' aero design achieved a three- to four-tenths m.p.g. increase for almost nothing,"" Gartman writes.', 'Automakers began relying more heavily on wind tunnels and aerodynamic calculations when designing their cars, and engineers started working more closely with designers. Within just a few years, virtually every car on the market suddenly looked like the once-futuristic Taurus. ""They all looked the same because they were all being shaped in the wind tunnel, and were designed for fuel economy,"" says Larry Edsall, the author of several books on car design history.', 'Technology made it easier to produce curves', 'A few key technological developments made these designs possible — and have since allowed automakers to make their cars curvier and curvier.', 'For decades, designers had made car models using clay, wood, or other physical materials. During the 1980s, they began using computer models.', '""It\'s much easier to make these sorts of shapes with computer drawings, rather than wood,"" Sparke says. ""They gave automakers the means to produce those very soft curves.""

5ed79752-7735-4f6e-b1ab-1b57c10ca144,4w5lgv,is it ethical to kill poachers?,reddit,"['Protecting the world’s endangered species from poachers is dangerous business.', 'Over the past decade, more than 1,000 rangers have died in the line of duty, according to statistics released last week for World Ranger Day. Some deaths were caused by accidents or animals. Most, however, were murders committed by heavily armed poachers who enter national parks and other protected areas in search of species such as tigers, rhinos, and elephants.', 'At the same time, rangers have killed hundreds of poachers, often spurred by the shoot on sight policies that have become the norm in several parks. The numbers add up: Between 2011 and 2015, rangers at South Africa’s Kruger National Park alone reportedly killed nearly 500 poachers.', 'While these rangers are undoubtedly heroes who all too often lay down their lives to protect the animals in their care, some organizations have begun to raise questions about the retaliatory bloodshed, asking if it is ethical or moral for rangers to kill suspected poachers without arrest or trial. The issue came to bear most recently last month after a guard in India’s Kaziranga National Park, which has a shoot-to-kill policy, critically wounded a seven-year-old boy from a tribe that lives around the park.', '""We’re pretty horrified by the situation,"" said Sophie Grig, senior campaigner at Survival International, a tribal rights organization that has criticized the recent Kaziranga shooting and shoot-to-kill policies in general. ""It seems to us a very worrying trend that is bad for both local people who get caught in the crossfire and for conservation.""', 'Grig also wonders if shooting poachers even solves the larger problem. ""If you were arresting those people and then investigating them, you could trace back and work out who the kingpins are,"" she said. ""If you shoot them dead, you can’t ask them any questions.""', 'Annette Hübschle, who recently authored a report on rhino poaching for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, echoed those sentiments. She said the ""current militarized approach"" is pushing people away from any chance they might have to participate in conservation. ""There should be a greater focus on investigating the transporters and buyers, prosecuting organized criminals such as kingpins and smugglers, ‘follow the money’ approaches, and seizing assets of criminals,"" she said.', 'Aside from legal strategies, the issue of whether or not poachers should be killed brings up several potential lines of ethical thought, said Anna Peterson, a professor in the department of religion at the University of Florida and the author of Being Animal: Beasts and Boundaries in Nature Ethics.', 'One way of thinking about it, she said, is to ask if individual sentient beings have value and if there is a difference in that value between a human life and that of a rhinoceros. She pointed to ethicist Tom Regan’s test, which asked if you would throw a dog out of a lifeboat to save yourself. ""Essentially, Regan said you would always throw out the dog on the basis of complexity and what would be lost by a human’s death rather than a dog’s death,"" she said.', 'More broadly, Peterson said, you could ask if a species is rare and significant and if its ecosystem would suffer in its absence. This ecological perspective could come into play when discussing species such as rhinos, tigers, and elephants. ""We have that debate here about Florida panthers, which are both rare and important predators,"" she said.', 'Finally, Peterson looked at the question from the field of ethics known as war theory. ""The just war theory,"" she said, ""lays out a series of criteria, such as do you have a just cause and have you tried to fix this peacefully?"" If we consider preserving ecosystems to be a just cause, then killing could be justified. Similarly, so could looking at poaching as an economic issue, as it threatens tourism, or as a national security issue, an important consideration involving organized crime, smuggling, national borders, and related crimes such as drugs and weapons.', 'No one has easy answers. ""Rangers are doing difficult jobs in difficult circumstances,"" Grig said. She added, though, that the often public enthusiasm for killing poachers seems contrary to the call to protect human rights in just about any other crime. ""I think this is something we need to be discussing,"" she said.']",Is It Ethical to Kill Poachers?,"The people who protect the world’s most endangered species are often asked to be judge, jury, and executioner.","Wildlife, Environment, In the News","['http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/styles/inline_thumbnail/public/Bushmeat-Patrol-PROMO-1b.jpg?itok=6fcCSzU-', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=14223123&c3=&c4=http://www.takepart.com/article/2016/08/03/it-ethical-kill-poachers?fb_comment_id=1054182597992671_1054639161280348&comment_id=1054639161280348&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/styles/homepage_featured_image/public/elephant-poacher-MAIN.jpg?itok=qC6pBXmq', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://www.takepart.com/sites/all/themes/base/images/logo.png', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/styles/homepage_featured_image/public/PromoOwlFire.jpg?itok=CAi6k7nF', 'http://web.archive.org/static/images/toolbar/wm_tb_prv_off.png', 'http://web.archive.org/static/images/toolbar/wm_tb_nxt_on.png', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/styles/70x70_thumbnail/public/profiles/photos/jornrplattbiopic.jpg?itok=vDbxsYXg', 'http://web.archive.org/static/images/toolbar/wayback-toolbar-logo.png', 'http://web.archive.org/web/jsp/graph.jsp?graphdata=550_27_1996:-1:000000000000_1997:-1:000000000000_1998:-1:000000000000_1999:-1:000000000000_2000:-1:000000000000_2001:-1:000000000000_2002:-1:000000000000_2003:-1:000000000000_2004:-1:000000000000_2005:-1:000000000000_2006:-1:000000000000_2007:-1:000000000000_2008:-1:000000000000_2009:-1:000000000000_2010:-1:000000000000_2011:-1:000000000000_2012:-1:000000000000_2013:-1:000000000000_2014:-1:000000000000_2015:-1:000000000000_2016:7:000000030000_2017:-1:000000000000', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/styles/homepage_featured_image/public/rhino-promo.jpg?itok=pqNxq11Q', 'http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/elephant-poachers.jpg']",http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638/http://www.takepart.com/article/2016/08/03/it-ethical-kill-poachers?cmpid=tp-ptnr-huffpost,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'No. [takepart]', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}","['preserving ecosystems to be a just cause, then killing could be justified']","[[[10, 244], [10, 317]]]",['passage']

A perfectly legitimate charge has been flagged as fraudulent, and the result is an agitated customer and a retailer with unsold merchandise.', 'MasterCard has now turned to artificial intelligence to better differentiate between real and mistaken fraud, hoping to tamp down on the former while allowing the latter to go through. It’s the latest financial services company to see the potential for the burgeoning field of machine learning to improve security on its network and enhance the customer experience.', 'Financial institutions have for years collected data on customers’ habits and routines, and used the information to pinpoint cards that may have been compromised. That’s the reason your card may be declined if you make an unusually large purchase, shop at a store for the first time, or buy gas in a place far from home. The system is essentially deciding whether that behavior seems normal according to predetermined questions, then accepting or declining the purchase based on its decision.', '""The old method was using tests and thresholds and other sorts of rules. With a rules-based approach, you get a tremendous amount of false positives,"" said Todd Marlin, a principal in Ernst & Young’s forensic technology and discovery services practice.', '""What we’re seeing is sort of a gold rush into artificial intelligence,"" Marlin said.', 'Machine learning can help fraud-detection systems become smarter about what fraud actually looks like, both across the network and on an individual level. For example, the system might detect that you haven’t shopped at a particular merchant in the past, but still accept the purchase because customers with a similar spending history shop there often. Or perhaps you travel to a certain state or country often enough that the system learns purchases there are likely to be legitimate.', 'Citing a survey from Javelin Advisory Services, MasterCard estimates that $118 billion in sales were declined due to falsely identified fraud in the United States in 2014 — well more than the $9 billion lost to actual instances of fraud. That’s a large sum of money that retailers — and credit card purveyors like MasterCard — could be pocketing.', 'MasterCard’s new Decision Intelligence software pulls in data, sometimes hundreds of pieces of data, about a specific transaction at the moment a customer swipes his or her credit card. The system then combines all of that information to yield a score indicating how likely the transaction is to be fraudulent. Each score builds on the one before it and informs the one after it such that the computer’s algorithm gets better at detecting fraud without a programmer having to engineer every change. The company called it ""the first use of AI being implemented on a global scale directly on the MasterCard network.""', '""For this to work we need all kinds of data coming in,"" said Ajay Bhalla, the president of enterprise risk and security at MasterCard. ""We’ve been working on a strategy of getting more data points into the network.', '""We see this as a critical component of our future strategy,"" Bhalla added. ""We are embedding AI in everything we’re looking at as a company.""', 'For the last decade, Visa has deployed its Visa Advanced Authorization system to detect fraud. The volume of data and the speed at which it’s processed have increased considerably over that time, said Mark Nelsen, the company’s senior vice president of risk products and business intelligence. Visa parses through those large sets of data to discern what characteristics distinguish legitimate and fraudulent spending, and then uses those characteristics to assess the veracity of future purchases.', '""We can look at that transaction and, knowing what we’ve seen in the past, we can predict if this is going to be good or bad,"" Nelsen said.', 'Digital payment platforms are also embracing machine learning, though fraud remains more difficult to detect in online or mobile commerce. PayPal has developed its own artificial intelligence software to combat fraud, allowing the company to move from a system that can analyze tens of data points to one that can analyze thousands. ""There’s a magnitude of difference — you’ll be able to analyze a lot more information and identify patterns that are a lot more sophisticated,"" PayPal’s senior director of global risk and data sciences, Hui Wang, told American Banker.', 'But Visa, MasterCard and PayPal have the financial heft and risk appetite to explore artificial intelligence in ways that smaller and more regional players in the financial services industry do not, said Celent analyst Arin Ray. While most in the industry think AI holds promise, there remain questions about how it will impact regulatory compliance and that makes some hesitant to embrace the technology, according to a report Ray co-authored in August.', '""The concept of AI has been there for 50 years, but it really has had a rebirth of sorts in the last three or four years. The volume of data has grown exponentially in recent times, so there is definitely the need for tools to [analyze it],"" Ray said in an interview.', '""One [concern] is how this technology will impact their existing operations.

40258287-e2f2-4491-81ca-fb8f40f6629a,4yjpbz,why women are no longer catching up to men on pay,reddit,"['If you were an American man working full-time in 1984, you earned, on average, a bit more than $22 an hour (adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars). If you were particularly ambitious, or particularly in need of cash, you could make more money by working more hours, but on a per-hour basis, you’d still be making about the same — a bit more than $22 per hour.', 'Fast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different. The average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour. But the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour. Hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions. (The pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay.)', 'Notice that I said ""men."" Men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more. So as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall.', 'The gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years. In 1964, according to data from the Census Bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents. (These calculations don’t take into account differences in experience, industry or other factors.) More recently, however, progress for women has nearly stalled out: In 2014, the latest data available, women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a 2-pennies-an-hour improvement over a decade.', 'Other measures of women’s progress in the workforce — their rate of employment, the likelihood that they will work in a historically male-dominated field, the rate at which they run big companies — show a similar pattern of what researchers Martha J. Bailey and Thomas A. DiPrete, in a new essay, call ""five decades of remarkable but slowing change"" for American women.', 'Bailey and DiPrete’s essay serves as the introduction to a remarkable new collection of papers from the Russell Sage Foundation that examines the progress that women have — and haven’t — made over the past half-century. It isn’t a simple story. The U.S. has already made major, albeit incomplete, progress on many of the most obvious causes of gender inequality — explicit discrimination on pay, overt barriers to employment, taboos against working while raising children. What is left is a tangle of cultural norms, implicit biases, individual preferences and other, subtler forms of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure.', 'Take the long-hours anecdote I described above. The rapid rise in pay for people working long hours has played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap, particularly for parents; new research in the Russell Sage Foundation volume estimates that the wage gap between mothers and fathers would be 15 percent smaller if the extra-hours increase hadn’t occurred. But that premium itself isn’t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average).', 'Rather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours. That, in turn, is the result of a confluence of factors that are deeply embedded in the American economy and society: Women, on average, spend much more time than men on housework, while men — especially a certain category of highly educated, elite men — are expected to work as much as possible. And of course, most importantly, mothers are still far more likely than fathers to be the primary caregiver for their children. Government policies could make a difference — affordable child care, for example, could make it easier for women who want to work long hours to do so — but they can only go so far.', 'The Russell Sage Foundation papers are full of such thorny issues. A rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by ""pre-market"" factors such as choice of industry and occupation; those issues can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differentials within a given job. And even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: Women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men — there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates — yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers. Girls now outperform boys in many science and math subjects in high school, but women are still much less likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical fields; women have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decades. And the overall rate of ""occupational desegregation"" — women entering traditionally male-dominated fields and vice versa — has slowed.', 'There are some encouraging signs for women. Those who do go into science and technology fields earn nearly as much as equally experienced men (though that isn’t true in computer science), suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more women entered so-called STEM fields. Moreover, the ""motherhood penalty"" — the relative decline in wages for women when they have children — has disappeared or even reversed for highly paid, highly educated women, perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to (and be able to afford) child care. That suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for less-educated women, too — something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidates are advocating affordable-child-care plans. Culture is changing, too: Men are taking on a larger share of child-rearing responsibilities, though the division is still far from equal.', 'Still, the overall picture painted by the Russell Sage Foundation research is one of slow, grinding and unsteady progress, and of barriers that are hard to define and even harder to resolve. Hillary Clinton may be poised to crack the ultimate glass ceiling, but true gender equality remains a long way off.', 'The Olympic tax', 'Speaking of high-earning (and high-flying) women, the internet was abuzz this week with stories about the hefty tax bill that gymnast Simone Biles and other Olympic medalists will face when they get back from Rio. The BBC estimated Biles will owe more than $40,000. A bipartisan bill to exempt Olympic winnings from taxes is gaining momentum in Congress.', 'But the whole issue is getting blown out of proportion. The U.S. Olympics Committee awards bonuses to American medal winners: $25,000 for gold medals and smaller amounts for silver and bronze. Biles, with her five medals, will receive $110,000, which in theory could put her on the hook for more than $40,000 in taxes. (The medals themselves are also taxable, but their actual value is modest.) But it’s unlikely she’ll actually owe that much because Biles and other Olympians can deduct the cost of their training on their taxes. And in the case of high-profile Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Michael Phelps, their actual winnings are dwarfed by far more lucrative (and very much taxable) endorsement deals. By the time Biles cashes all those checks from Procter & Gamble, her Olympic tax bill will probably look like a rounding error.', 'The Fed', 'Newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting this week suggest that Board Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are still weighing whether to raise interest rates in September or wait until the economy improves further. Separate comments from key Fed officials this week indicated that new data since the Fed’s meeting hasn’t resolved the question.', 'The Fed is in a tricky spot. The job market continues to show strength; May’s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip. But overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending — a key pillar of strength in recent months — is beginning to weaken. Then there is the election, which complicates the Fed’s task in two ways: Policymakers don’t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy. Most economists still think the Fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates.', 'Number of the week', 'Back in July, I wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths. A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 53.2 percent of Americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in July, up from 52.7 percent last year and 50.7 percent in 2013. The report didn’t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too. Moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers.']",Why Women Are No Longer Catching Up To Men On Pay,"This is In Real Terms, a column analyzing the week in economic news.

The study was not provided in the column, so it’s not clear what new information it contained.

Bush pulled 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004. Avoiding the approach advocated by folks like Coulter or Schlafly, he spoke some Spanish, supported immigration reform and refrained from ranting against Latinos during interviews with the media.', 'Many observers have concluded that the Republican Party would perform better among Latinos if it moderated the intransigent stance on immigration adopted by hardliners like Coulter.

f02f2695-4233-4fd3-b340-0596c335cc57,4j7om8,what happened when a professor built a chatbot to be his teaching assistant,reddit,"['Here’s a sample interaction between the chatbot and a student. (Courtesy Ashok Goel)', 'To help with his class this spring, a Georgia Tech professor hired Jill Watson, a teaching assistant unlike any other in the world. Throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professor’s overworked teaching staff.', 'But, in fact, Jill Watson was an artificial intelligence bot.', 'Ashok Goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal Watson’s true identity to students until after they’d turned in their final exams.', 'Students were amazed. ""I feel like I am part of history because of Jill and this class!"" wrote one in the class’s online forum. ""Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA in the CIOS survey!"" said another.', 'Now Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education. While he doesn’t foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbot’s question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally don’t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. With more human-like interaction, Goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes.', '""To me this is a grand challenge,"" Goel said. ""Education is such a huge priority for the entire human race.""', 'At the start of this semester Goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including Jill, the automated question and answering service Goel developed with the help of some of his students and IBM.', 'Goel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the course’s online forum. Sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. Last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions.', 'As Goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on IBM Watson, which he had used for several other projects. Watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit.', 'To train the system to answer questions correctly, Goel fed it forum posts from the class’s previous semesters. This gave Jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered.', 'Goel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether Jill’s answers were correct. Initially the system struggled with similar questions such as ""Where can I find assignment two?"" and ""When is assignment two due?"" Goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. Eventually Jill reached the point where its answers were good enough.', '""I cannot create chaos in my classroom. Jill had to be almost perfect as a human TA or I am,"" Goel said.', 'The system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. Goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate.', 'There are many questions Jill can’t handle. Those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants.', 'Goel plans to use Jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isn’t human.']",What happened when a professor built a chatbot to be his teaching assistant,These students were shocked to find out they'd been chatting with a robot all

""There it is!"" gleeful scorekeeper Christie called on ball three, ""The memorized 25-second speech!""', 'Londonderry High School was greeted first by two cardboard and tinfoil robots, who mechanically droned Rubio\'s now-defining line, ""Let\'s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\'t know what he\'s doing. He knows exactly what he\'s doing,"" over and over. Although the beleaguered Rubio campaign was quick to call it another Bush dirty trick, the Marco Robotos were animated by operatives from Democratic Super PAC American Bridge. Kevin McAllister, the PAC\'s deputy communications director-turned-costumed robot, said the campaign\'s only inspiration was provided by Christie, and the opportunity was irresistible.', 'Rubio strategists downplayed the attention their candidate\'s debate performance was getting. ""I think it\'s a narrow band of folks who read each other on Twitter,"" Jim Merrill, a Rubio senior advisor for New Hampshire, said, dismissing the entire affair. ""We\'re going to focus on President Obama."" Any slip of the gears isn\'t going to affect Tuesday\'s results. ""We have a very strong ground game.""', 'Merrill was also unconcerned by the fact that a morning pancake breakfast appeared to be transforming into a mid-morning rally. ""I don\'t know where they got the idea to come at 8:30. Nobody said that,"" he said. ""People just got here early,"" he explained, pointing out that the campaign was offering free muffins, berries, and juice.', 'Not everyone—especially the hundreds who\'d received the campaign\'s invitation for an 8:30 pancake breakfast—was satisfied. ""It\'s the Marco Rubio pancake breakfast—so far we\'ve had no pancakes and no Marco Rubio,"" joked Bob Durant, a Rhode Island lawyer who was political touring with his family and friends. ""You wonder is it really because you have so many people,"" that things are delayed, Bob asked, or is it because, after the debate, ""He has to re-write his entire speech, since Chris Christie ripped it up?""', 'His wife, Meg, was watching it all with more of an insider\'s eye. The Michigan state director for the Bush/Quayle 1992 campaign, Meg Durant looks for the little things to tell her how a campaign is doing. After Saturday\'s Republican debate, she grabbed a couple of Christie and Bush signs for her kids. Some Christie volunteers followed her all the way back to her car. ""They waited for me to drive away,"" to make sure she didn\'t replace one of their Christie signs with a Bush sign. ""Christie\'s people, they are street fighters.""', 'Still, she admitted, it\'s been difficult to predict how things are going. ""I thought Jeb had it. I thought he was a shoo-in,"" when the race first got underway. After Bush began to founder, ""I thought Marco would have walked away with it. But after last night..."" she gave a little shrug. ""I hope this morning is the Marco we want to see.""', 'Durant was also finding it difficult to figure how event turnout, especially with the rising interest in political tourism, translates into votes. ""There are ten of us here,"" she noted, ""and only one of us is a New Hampshire voter."" That would be her cousin, Tom Stevens, a retired lawyer who moved from Ohio to New Hampshire two years ago. He\'s still undecided; his wife was for Hillary Clinton until she went to a Clinton rally last week. Now, she\'s undecided, too.', 'When Rubio finally showed up a little after ten, he was as flat as, well, a pancake. ""A couple of housekeeping items,"" were the first words out of his mouth. ""We couldn\'t figure out how to make pancakes for 800 people—I hope they fed you.""', 'It didn\'t get better. He\'s still going to abolish the federal Department of Education, but he\'s decided to offer Tom Brady ""a cabinet position. Belichick, too."" And then, because at best he can only really modify and not stop himself, ""Well, I\'m going to say it again.... Barack Obama is the first president, at least in my lifetime, that wants to change the country. ... Not fix its problems; he wants to make it a different kind of country.""', 'Things perked up a little bit when Rubio agreed to answer a few questions, calling on innocuous-looking white haired fellow in a bright flannel shirt. Identifying himself as Capt. Dan, a 65-year-old retired charter boat operator and a Rubio constituent from Florida, he wondered what a President Rubio would do about the climate change flooding that\'s putting his house in Miami Beach underwater. ""I\'m going to get my money out of it and move to higher ground,"" Capt. Dan explained, who added that he doesn\'t expect to live forever. Isn\'t there something Rubio can do about climate change ""for the young people?""', 'Rubio has a script for this question. Climate change legislation hurts the economy. It hurts the economy and has no real impact on the environment. The better approach is to support innovators of American energy. ""I say, \'OK, if we pass this bill how many feet of sea rise will it prevent?\'"" he explained, reasonably, as he has on this and many other occasions. ""\'Well, it won\'t prevent any sea rise.\' OK, well how many degrees of temperature will it avoid going up?\' Well, it won\'t do that either.""', 'But afterwards, Capt. Dan professed to be happy with Rubio\'s response. ""Last time I heard him say it,"" which just happened to be in Manchester two days ago, ""he said it was too expensive, too difficult, wait."" This time ""he started to look to the side a little bit, see a different way to see it."" Possibly so. Reframing climate change as a family issue, not an environmental one, could certainly cause Rubio some cognitive dissonance. Very possibly that could be the conscious intent of folksy Capt. Dan, who traveled all the way to New Hampshire because ""this is such an intimate state where I have access to all the candidates....where I can ask the questions I want to ask."" Folksy Capt. Dan Kipnis, who traveled all the way to New Hampshire on the dime of a climate change organization. Capt. Dan Kipnis, member of the Miami-Dade County Climate Change Advisory Task Force. Capt.

It grew a little wearying. ""Nobody is,"" he started, and then corrected himself, ""There are a few people from New Hampshire.""', 'Watching from a ledge behind him was Kaity Thomson, a recent University of New Hampshire graduate, who\'d come to hear Rubio with her co-worker and friend Yuxi Wang. ""We were expecting pancakes,"" said Thomson, who is now working for 350.org, the international environmental citizens pressure group. ""It\'s crazy.""

2fa7e33c-5e68-4153-bf75-f226d9abe08f,532201772509843456,is there a better way to observe veteran's day?,Twitter,"['All this isn’t to suggest that Americans never mark Veterans Day and Memorial Day. In communities across the country, members of the military, members of government, and military families gather on both holidays to raise and lower flags, decorate graves, and participate in processions and parades. On Memorial Day, some people observe the national one-minute Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m., which was passed into law by Congress in 2000. Observation of the Moment is left up to participating organizations, such as Amtrak and Major League Baseball. And, as in the U.K. and Canada, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) distributes poppies on Veterans Day and Memorial Day so that people can publicly commemorate the fallen. The numbers don’t lie, though: according to the VFW, only 9 million poppies will be distributed in the U.S. (population: 316 million) this year. By comparison, 45 million poppies will be distributed in the U.K. (population: 64 million) for Armistice Day, according to The Royal British Legion. Why doesn’t the United States have a common culture of commemoration? One potential explanation lies in the fact that the U.S. hasn’t recently experienced the kind of generational destruction that, say, the First and Second World Wars brought to Britain and Russia, respectively. Britain lost approximately 2 percent of its population in the Great War, resulting in a ""lost generation."" Jay Winter of Yale University told me that those men ""left behind ... a void, an absence, a black hole in the center of thousands of families defined in part by who wasn’t there."" The Soviet Union suffered an even more dramatic loss in the Second World War—amounting to roughly 15 percent of its population. By comparison, U.S. losses in the Second World War constituted about 0.3 percent of the population, and 0.1 percent in the First World War. The only American war that incurred such steep losses was the Civil War, in which 2 percent of the population perished. It should come as no surprise, then, that the trauma of that conflict led to the establishment of Decoration Day, the precursor of Memorial Day.', 'Differences in how military holidays are observed can’t be reduced to a numbers game, though. In the United States, at least, they may also stem from a strain of American thinking that highlights historical triumphs and skips over what those triumphs have cost. Lindsey Tepe of the New America Foundation, for instance, has written about the ways in which public education has become a battleground between those who view American history as ""a sweeping tale filled with ... grand heroes, epic battles, and the continuing struggle for the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"" and those who recognize that ""American history is also full of inconvenient truths ... and the injustices perpetrated throughout the course of building this nation."" Winter argues that ""what makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in American narratives of war."" In the U.K., on the other hand, ""the absence of the Lost Generation mattered more."" When America’s national mythology and political discourse preach a tale of endless victory and exceptionalism, there is less of an incentive to focus on those men and women who didn’t come home from battle. ""What makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in its narratives of war."" The finer details make a difference as well. Joe Davis, director of public affairs at the VFW, believes the All-Volunteer Force, established in 1973, drove a wedge between the military community and an ever-growing civilian population. During the Second World War, the United States fielded a conscription-based military of approximately 16 million people, out of a population of 135 million. Today, the professional military is well below its troop level during World War II, and the U.S. population has more than doubled in the interim. Davis also cited as a factor the shifting of Memorial Day from its original, fixed date of May 30 to the last Monday of May. ""When you link a military holiday to a three-day weekend, you lose the meaning of the day,"" Davis told me. Whatever the explanation, the lack of an appropriate occasion to commemorate America’s war casualties has been noted. From 1989 until his passing in 2012, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date—and, by proxy, its original intent. Separately, two bills have been introduced in Congress in the last two years alone—one to establish two minutes of silence on Veterans Day, the other to do the same on Memorial Day. Neither bill has been passed, although the one for Veterans Day has since been revised as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The timing of these bills is opportune. Judging by recent polls, the American public is war-weary and largely of the view that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were failures. A debate is also underway about what America’s global role should be, with many Americans leaning toward isolationism (despite a surge of support for a more muscular U.S. foreign policy following ISIS’s beheading of American journalists). In this environment, it would be worthwhile to rigorously observe a moment in which Americans collectively acknowledge the good that their country has done in the world—and the real, human costs that have accompanied that involvement.']",Is There a Better Way to Observe Veterans Day?,Other countries offer models for truly nationwide tributes to military service and sacrifice.,"The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life","['http://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.23.6--NS/0', 'http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6463921&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1407501962855831&ev=NoScript', 'http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-906344h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript', 'https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/11/RTR4DOTE/lead_large.jpg', 'https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/11/RTR4DOTE/lead_large.jpg?1430150302', 'http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-b0K-eQJGBXxXE.gif', 'http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2013/11/veteranlarge/a682ac40a.jpg', 'http://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.22--NS/0', 'https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/authors/d/edward-delman/headshot/headshot.jpg?1431456352']",http://theatln.tc/1qCr2IQ,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Yes.', 'spoilerPublisher': 'SavedYouAClick'}","['Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date—and, by proxy, its original intent']","[[[1, 2198], [1, 2370]]]",['passage']

But with the number of Sean Bean fatalities caught on camera brought back into the spotlight with his new show Legends, maybe it’s time to put the many demises into perspective.', 'Start looking at the numbers, and many leading actors have died at least a few times. A long enough career can rack up the kills. For example, Robert de Niro has died on screen 19 times. Other stars like Leonardo DiCaprio have died 9 times. So where does Sean Bean fall along this list?', 'I crafted the following chart to find out:', 'Click to enlarge!*', 'It looks like the ""walking spoiler"" meme has a grain of truth to it. While Bean does have over 70 movies under his belt, he certainly dies in a lot of them — almost a third of his films.', 'However, even though Bean has perfected his ""I’m dying"" face, he still hasn’t died the most on screen. Two legendary horror actors, Vincent Prince and Bela Lugosi, each outpace Bean by at least 10 movies.', 'But the top honor of most on-screen deaths goes to wonderful character actor John Hurt.

For that we could compare deaths per film to standardize among the actors. If we do that, Sean Bean is still at the top of the list with 0.32 deaths/film, tied with Bela Lugosi, and followed closely by Mickey Rourke and John Hurt with 0.31 deaths/film. Vincent Price and Cary Tagawa are next with 0.28 deaths/film, and it decreases from there. (For the curious: South Park‘s Kenny barely beats Bean with 0.38 deaths/episode.)', 'Of course, Bean has indeed racked up a large number of deaths early on in his career, relatively speaking (he has made far fewer films compared to Lugosi, Price, and Hurt). In the years to come, we could see Boromir bite the dust enough to become the undisputed duke of the death scene.', 'Kyle Hill is the Science Editor of Nerdist Industries.

It’s surprisingly easy to make a name for yourself and garner 15 minutes of fame.', 'The newest member of the ""Gone Viral"" club is none other than Texas native Candace Payne. A wife of nearly 15 years and mom to two youngsters, Payne seemed to be all over your Facebook Newsfeed and everywhere else on the internet over the last few days when a Facebook Live video of her unboxing a ""Chewbacca"" mask and laughing hysterically went mega viral.', 'We’re talking – ""It broke the internet.""', 'Literally, Candace Payne’s video has set new records as being the most-viewed Facebook Live video with over 133 MILLION views.', 'But just hours after her video blew up the internet, Payne goes on record with the real reason she put on that mask, and we – for the first time – have begun to understand why Candace’s little stunt is about more than just a funny moment dressed as Chewbacca in the front seat of a car.', 'She walked into Kohl’s to buy yoga pants, but little did Candace know that God had other plans for her.', '""I honestly wasn’t there for the mask,"" Payne told ""I honestly wasn’t there for the mask,"" Payne told Good Morning America .

But I can get a toy for my kids.’ And I walk through the toy section and I accidentally bumped my shoulder into this box. And I had seen this before, but I didn’t realize it made sounds until that moment. It accidentally started making the growl, and I went, ‘I need to get that. Like, I don’t think my kids need that, I think I need that.’""', 'A few minutes later, Candace is in her car only 30 minutes away from needing to be ""responsible"" as she puts it, and pick up her children from school. But with only a few minutes to spare, she couldn’t contain herself and decided to do an ‘unboxing’ in her car and show her friends on Facebook her new find.', 'So with a smile that’s worth more than its weight in gold, she introduced herself to the interwebs and began to take the ""Chewie"" mask out of the box and put it on.', 'Then laughter ensued. Candace says she tipped her head back and caught a glimpse of herself in the rearview mirror and she couldn’t contain the belly laugh that came out of her. And as she saw the reactions of people responding live to her post, she got even more vivacious. To the point that she couldn’t stop laughing and tears flowed out of her eyes.', 'I was struck by a very distinct feeling the first time I watched Candace’s hilarious video. I’ve seen plenty of viral videos before — in fact, it’s a part of my job. But something is different about Candace Payne.', '""For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."" -Romans 14:17', 'Candace is no ordinary ""15-minute-famer."" In fact, it wouldn’t surprise me if Candace’s influence extends long past 15 minutes.', 'Not only is Payne adorable and obviously so much fun, it turns out that she’s someone who loves Jesus too. And boy does it show. Candace is active in her church, The Oaks Fellowship in Red Oak, Texas (just outside of Dallas) and she’s a dedicated wife and momma.', 'Just 48 hours after her video had gone viral, Candace got up on stage with a message to young creatives at an Arts conference in Texas, and gave nuggets of wisdom that are clearly directly from Heaven.', '""When I was 16, I had a vision and a dream from the Lord about my future being used for His glory. I didn’t understand the interpretation of it. I still to this day, at 37-years-old, try to figure that dream out. But that dream has never left my heart, nor my mind, nor the way that I walk and follow Jesus. And I know that God has gifted me in many different areas and sometimes, I feel like I wake up and I’m a Jack-of-many-trades and a master-of-none because I have that creative buzz in me, constantly going,"" said Candace.', 'But here’s where her words get really good.', '""It doesn’t matter how talented, how anointed, how gifted, how passionate, or how willing you are if you’re not fit to do the things that God has called you to do... And that is spiritually fit. The thing that will take you further and farther in the Kingdom of God is three things: diligence, patience, and obedience... Do not try to make a name for yourself. His name will always outshadow yours."" -Candace Payne', 'And that’s not all of the mic drop moments Candace spoke. Take a look at her whole encouragement to the kids at the Regional Fine Arts event:', '""I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in Him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit."" -Romans 15:13', 'One of the markers of Jesus’ work in your life is that you have joy. It doesn’t mean that you never feel sad or have a bad day, but it does mean that an unspeakable exuberance and delight fills you that sometimes there aren’t words to explain.', 'Often, a hallmark of the Holy Spirit’s work in your life is joy. And many times that comes in the form of laughter — deep, beautiful laughter — that not only releases joy in you, but in the lives of others.', 'Candace Payne’s video went viral not just because she’s delightful and hilarious and so much fun to watch (although all of those things are true). Her video caught the attention of millions of people because she is FILLED with the love and joy of Jesus. And God used a beautiful daughter from Texas, in a Chewbacca mask; deciding to look past her discouragement about not finding yoga pants that fit, and find happiness in something as simple as a plastic Star Wars toy to bring joy to people’s lives.', '""Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord’s people."" -Philemon 1:7', 'Don’t believe me? As if the record-breaking 133 Million views isn’t enough (that’s more views than Mark Zuckerberg has friends, by the way), then listen to the response of people who watched her video:', 'Candace shared on Candace shared on Good Morning America that the best note she received as a result of her video is from a mom who has a daughter with autism who laughed over and over for the first time in over two months as she watched Candace’s hilarious stunt.', '""From one mama heart to another mama, to see a child laugh that you haven’t seen laugh, those are the stories that I’m going to take with me everyday,"" said Candace.', 'The world is hungry — no, they’re starving — for the joy of the Lord. The Bible says that His joy is our strength. If you are lacking joy in your life, start by asking God to give you His joy and then belly-laugh along with Candace. Then go and spread your joy with others and you’ll find that your joy will be always flowing.', 'And apparently Candace agrees with me as she said this morning on Good Morning America :', '""I think the world as a whole, is in need of a good laugh. I think we’re in need of somebody to lift our spirits, to not take ourselves too seriously and to break some cynicism — worldwide.""', 'Thank you so much Candace Payne for sharing the joy of the Lord that is inside of you with the world. You have no idea how inspiring you really are... Or maybe you do since you let the fruit of the Spirit come out of you so freely. Either way, thank you, from the bottoms of our hearts for bringing more joy to the world through your laugh and letting your light shine.', '""Those who have been ransomed by the LORD will return.

The year before, she had flu-like symptoms for a week after getting the shot."", '""I also worried if everyone at work knew I got a flu shot, it\'ll be harder to take sick days if I do get the flu,"" says Walsh, 38.', 'Ultimately, however, Walsh got jabbed, and experts agree it was the right call. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center found that getting a flu shot reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalization by 71.4 percent for all adults and 76.8 percent for those over age 50 during the 2011-2012 flu season.', 'The CDC estimates deaths associated with the flu number between 3,000 and 49,000 people each year.', ""One reason people don't get vaccinated is cost. Flu shots aren't always free. Most insurance does cover vaccinations administered at a doctor's office. But walk into your local CVS or Walgreen and you'll likely pay at least $35. Insurance won't necessarily cover shots at retail pharmacies."", 'Employers can help bring down those costs - and likely save themselves money as well. The CDC estimates that seasonal influenza outbreaks average $10.4 billion in direct costs due to medical treatment and hospitalizations. Part of those costs are then passed along to employers in the form of higher premiums and lost productivity.', ""Typically, more than 200,000 people are hospitalized each year for flu-related illness. Many large firms like Walsh's offer free flu shot clinics, but letting workers know they won't be penalized for taking sick leave can also pay dividends for businesses big and small."", ""Last winter was a big year for influenza, and it caught many patients and healthcare providers off-guard after several years of milder flu seasons. It's too early to know how this year's will compare or even how many people have come down with the flu so far this autumn since those numbers, tracked by the CDC, weren't reported during the recent government shutdown."", 'Flu activity usually peaks in the United States in January or February. Recent studies from the European Union show the vaccine offers less immunity and has a shorter duration than previously thought, according to Kris Ehresmann, director of the infectious disease division at the Minnesota Department of Health. ""But now is the time to get vaccinated,"" she adds.', ""What's new this year, says Dr. Michael Jhung, medical officer at the CDC, is that many flu shots will immunize against four strains of the flu virus for the first time, an improved protection over years past. Drug companies plan to make 135 million to 139 million doses of vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration."", ""Several vaccination options are available. They include: a standard dose for adults and children, a high-dose shot for people over age 65, a nasal spray for those who don't like needles, and a dose that is egg-free for patients who are allergic."", 'Everyone over the age of 6 months should get one, experts say. ""We don\'t prefer one vaccine over another,"" Jhung says. ""Whatever vaccine patients choose, we\'re happy.""', 'The elderly, children under age 5, pregnant women, and people with other chronic health conditions are most vulnerable to the flu.', ""Getting immunized earlier guarantees protection whenever the flu season starts in earnest, Jhung notes. Plus, adults who don't get vaccinated can put others, including children, at risk. Only 42 percent of Americans got vaccinated in the 2011-2012 flu season, the latest data available from the CDC."", 'As an added bonus, a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that up to 36 percent of those vaccinated reduced their risk of heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular health problems just by getting a flu shot. Based on these findings, the researchers calculated that one death or serious illness due to heart trouble could be prevented by vaccinating 58 additional people.', 'Peter Delgado, a 66-year-old self-employed accountant, recently left a Cambridge, Massachusetts, Rite Aid before getting his flu shot. ""There was too much paperwork to fill out, and they wanted to charge me $70,"" says Delgado, who lives nearby. The high-dose version of the shot, recommended for older people, often costs more than the normal vaccine.', 'His wife, however, soon sent him back in. ""I told him, \'If you get sick from the flu and can\'t work, you\'ll feel foolish over $70,\'"" says Anne Delgado, 66, who is retired. ""One shot could mean food on the table for us.""

The reports indicate that at least half of his staff will be laid off in the wake of Clinton’s victories in New Jersey and California, though some of them might be offered jobs in Sanders’ Senate office.', 'A lot of the staff members who are being laid off are advance staff who often help with the logistics of setting up a campaign, but a lot of the field staff, who often handle phone calls and door to door campaigning, are being laid off as well.', 'The reports of the layoff came after Clinton’s victory on Tuesday where she won the majority of delegates in California and New Jersey. It is important to note that despite Clinton’s strong lead, she does not have enough pledged delegates to earn the nomination. She currently has 2,184 compared to Sanders 1,804. There are 158 pledged delegates still available and 2,383 are needed to win the nomination.', 'Clinton, who has been declared the party’s nominee by many in the media, such as the AP, does have the support of more than 500 super delegates, which is what puts her over the top. Super delegates are party officials who can support either candidate. The super delegates will not vote until the Democratic National Convention, which will be held the last week of July.', 'Despite the layoffs, Sanders is not ending his campaign and is hoping to be able to sway the super delegates to his side. Sanders will argue that he is the strongest candidate to face Donald Trump in November. It is an argument that Sanders has made throughout this primary season and it’s one that the poll numbers back up. The majority of polls have Sanders defeating Trump by a larger margin than Clinton does. A spokesman for the campaign, Micheal Briggs, reiterated this plan during a statement at a Sanders rally that was held on Monday in San Francisco.', '‘Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump’', 'Sanders has a long road ahead of him if he hopes to convince the party’s super delegates to back him over Clinton, as many of them have been strong supporters of her campaign since she first announced her candidacy. The Clintons have enjoyed strong support among the Democratic Party since Bill Clinton’s election in 1992. Whether or not Sanders can persuade the party’s leadership to back him remains to be seen, but it is a long shot.', 'A spokesman for the Sanders campaign, Briggs, has said that the senator is planning on heading back to Vermont on Wednesday, but will be back on the campaign trail by Thursday when he will head to Washington, DC. Sanders is planning on holding several rallies in Washington DC, which holds the last primary on June 14th.']",JUST IN: Bernie Sanders Makes MAJOR Announcement To His Entire Staff And Followers (QUOTES),Sources close to the Sanders campaign have reported the senator will soon be laying off at least half of his staff in wake of Clinton's victories.,,"['http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif', 'http://cdn.bipartisanreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cooper-page.jpg', 'http://cdn.bipartisanreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/logo1-300x58-300x58.png', 'http://cdn.bipartisanreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tr1.jpg', 'http://cdn.bipartisanreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bernie-and-hillary-2.jpg', 'http://cdn.bipartisanreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/647511766.jpg', 'http://cdn.bipartisanreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Joy-Behar-The-View.jpg', 'http://cdn.bipartisanreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/logo_big-300x58.png', 'http://cdn.bipartisanreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/trump-2.jpg', 'http://cdn.bipartisanreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/632063886.jpg', 'http://cdn.bipartisanreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-03_10-59-43.jpg', 'http://cdn.bipartisanreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GettyImages-642417872-1.jpg', 'http://cdn.bipartisanreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/24050281453_b64d18d320_z-e1465402581985.jpg']",http://bipartisan.report/2016/06/08/just-in-bernie-sanders-makes-major-announcement-to-his-entire-staff-and-followers-quotes/,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'The Sanders campaign will be laying off staff as the primaries draw to a close. #StopClickBait', 'spoilerPublisher': 'Stop Clickbait - World News'}",['begin laying off a large part of his staff starting Wednesday'],"[[[0, 82], [0, 143]]]",['passage']

He’s made real ground on Hillary Clinton, closing the gap between them by consolidating the Republican Party behind his candidacy. Clinton, meanwhile, is fighting a contentious primary, which keeps her from doing the same. There’s still a strong case to make that Donald Trump is a long shot for the White House—that he’s too unpopular with too many Americans outside the Republican Party and that if the Obama coalition holds, he loses.', 'Jamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate’s chief political correspondent.', 'At least, that’s what I think. But humility is a virtue, and life is volatile, even if elections often aren’t. That Trump is a poor bet for November doesn’t mean he couldn’t win. He could. Which raises an obvious question: How would it happen? And finding an answer here isn’t too difficult. You just need to reverse-engineer the conditions of a Trump loss. What are those conditions?', 'At the top of the list is demographics. Trump is deeply unpopular with black and Latino voters, as well as with women and young people. But Clinton is also unpopular, albeit by a smaller magnitude. Given two unpopular candidates, it’s possible that ""popularity"" just won’t matter as much, that voters will take both candidates’ worst qualities as a given and move on. In which case, both Clinton and Trump become generic nominees. And what are the prospects this year for a generic Republican nominee? Of five separate econometric models of the election, four predict a Republican win ranging from 50.9 percent of the vote to 55 percent of the two-party vote. The economy is middling, President Obama well-liked but not hugely popular, and Clinton would be a third term for Democrats. Given two generic candidates under those criteria, the presidency would go to the Republican. Say hello to President Trump.', 'Let’s say you don’t trust the models (they couldn’t predict Trump, after all). Then what? How would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? The answer is easy: He wins and turns out white voters in historic numbers. Assume higher nonwhite support for the Democrat—let’s say a three-point bump among blacks and a seven-point bump among Hispanics, giving Clinton 97 percent and 80 percent support, respectively—and Trump needs 66 percent of whites to win both the popular and electoral-college vote, if turnout doesn’t change. (You can play with the numbers over at RealClearPolitics.)', 'How would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? He turns out white voters in historic numbers.', 'It’s an extraordinary reach: an increase of nearly six points over the white share in 2012, matching Ronald Reagan’s performance in 1984. It would mean Trump persuaded millions of Democrats to switch teams, despite their wide approval for President Obama.', 'In other words, it’s not happening. Partisanship has a tight hold on American voting behavior, and it’s hard to imagine how Trump could break it, barring a national catastrophe. Easier to imagine is higher white turnout. If Trump could reverse the yearslong decline and bring white turnout back to its 2008 levels—74 percent—then he could win with another couple percentage points among whites, even with the high black and Latino turnout of 2008. This would give him teetering Democratic states such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as the three largest swing states: Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. It’s a heavy lift, especially for a candidate who says he will eschew data-gathering and other quantitative methods for finding and mobilizing supporters. But it’s possible.', 'OK, OK. ""Possible"" doesn’t mean ""likely,"" and it’s hard to imagine a disorganized campaign exceeding Team Romney’s ability to pinpoint and bring Republican-leaning white voters to the polls. Still, with a smile from Fortuna (or whichever god of chance you prefer), Trump can win. If anything guarantees defeat for an incumbent party, it’s a recession. At the opening of the 1960 election, in early spring of that year, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon were neck and neck. This continued into the summer and the early fall. But by October, Kennedy had opened a small but persistent lead. He won.', 'It’s hard to isolate a single cause for Kennedy’s victory, but he was almost certainly helped along by the modest recession that struck in the spring and lasted until the following winter. If not for that downturn, there’s a fair chance Nixon would have become president. A sudden slowdown could have the same effect on our election. In fact, the very presence of Trump—his proximity to the most powerful office in the world—could destabilize markets and make a downturn more likely. And consider this: On average, the United States sees a recession every five years. We’re due. One is all we need for President Trump.', 'A terrorist attack could do it—driving voters into the arms of the authoritarian in the race—but the literature is mixed on how terrorism affects voters. It could make them more attuned to perceived outsiders—and immigrants in particular—giving Trump an advantage. It could push them toward hawkish candidates with traditional credentials, helping Clinton. Or given the candidates, it could be a wash. So let’s table this one.', 'There’s one last thing that could deliver the White House to Trump: a divided Democratic Party. Party unity is a prerequisite for national competition. It’s why the ""Never Trump"" movement fell apart after Ted Cruz left the race; a serious effort to derail the Republican nominee would guarantee a Democratic White House, because it’s almost impossible to overcome the asymmetry. In the still unlikely event that the present acrimony between Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Party becomes an outright split, Democrats risk throwing the election to Trump, through in-fighting and division. If Sanders runs as a third-party candidate, the game is over, and Democrats lose. You see this in the most recent polling. Clinton’s biggest weakness in the NBC News survey of registered voters is with Sanders’ backers who haven’t crossed the threshold to Team Clinton. If this persists, it’s dangerous. If history is any indication, however, it won’t be.', 'With all this said, even the most probable scenario here—that Trump and Clinton become generic candidates—is a distant long shot.

In the 1980s, union members in blue states defied their leaders in organized labor to vote for the 40th president.', 'Well, in Nevada, the first of the early primary or caucus states with a significant number of Latino voters, we’ve caught a glimpse of a similar phenomenon—one that few could have imagined when Donald Trump entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination.', 'You may recall that the billionaire businessman launched his foray into politics eight months ago with a speech that declared that Mexican immigrants were ""bringing drugs"" and ""bringing crime,"" and that they were ""rapists,"" criminals and murderers even though, he assumed, ""some are good people."" Now, it seems, some of those good people are enamored of their tormentor.', 'Behold, the Trump Latinos.', 'According to CNN entrance polls, among Latino Republican voters in the Silver State, John Kasich got 4 percent, Ted Cruz 18 percent, and Marco Rubio 29 percent. Trump got an astounding 44 percent.', 'I can only think of two people who don’t seem surprised by Trump’s strong showing with Latinos.', 'The first is Trump himself, who has been saying for months that he would do well with Hispanics. In fact, Trump would often point to early polling from Nevada that showed him beating his rivals decisively with Hispanics, which is what happened.', 'Trump has a theory. He thinks that Hispanics know that he will create jobs and that many of these jobs will go to Hispanics because his years in business have taught him that Hispanics are especially hard workers.', 'The other person who saw this coming was me. Two weeks ago, I wrote a piece for this site that looked at the phenomenon of ""Latinos for Trump."" That piece was criticized by everyone from white Democrats to Latino activists to Republicans supported other candidates.', 'Now, if you look at the entrance polls out of Nevada, it seems clear that these critics don’t know much about Latinos.', 'Granted, these surveys are not the definitive final word. This was a small sample of voters, and many polling experts doubt the accuracy of entrance polls. Besides, we are talking about just Latino Republicans who went to vote on a given day in the state of Nevada. That’s hardly a representative sample of Latinos across the country.', 'And, finally, it is worth noting, most Latinos weren’t even on the table for Republicans in Nevada because more than two-thirds of the community are registered Democrats. In fact, if Trump is ultimately the Republican nominee, it will almost assure a Latino landslide for Hillary Clinton, who could walk away with as much as 80 percent of the Latino vote.', 'Still, all those caveats and conditions don’t change what happened in Nevada, or its significance. We need to unpack that.', 'But first, let me explain a few things about my tribe. The 54 million Latinos in the United States—whose ancestors can be traced to more than a dozen countries—could yield an estimated 13 million voters in November. And many of those voters will be in three battleground states—Nevada, Colorado, and Florida.', 'Next, there is no suspense as to which party will scoop up the lion’s share of those votes. It’s the same party that has won the majority of Latino votes in every presidential election since 1960: The Democratic Party. No Republican presidential candidate has ever won the majority of Latino votes.', 'Finally, while many in Washington will often try to compare Latinos with African-Americans as another aggrieved minority that has endured everything from inferior schools to overt discrimination to economic inequality, there is a competing line of thought that suggests Latinos are more comparable to other Catholic immigrant groups, like the Irish and Italians.', 'Like their European immigrant brethren, Latinos want to come to their ethnicity on their own terms. They are fiercely patriotic Americans who nonetheless identify as Latino. And they don’t feel as if they must choose one over the other.', 'That is relevant to this discussion because, as one reader put it to me recently: ""If these voters think like Americans, they’ll vote for Trump. If they think like Latinos, they won’t.""', 'Now, here’s what happened in Nevada. The Latino community in the United States—and especially the nearly 70 percent of that population that is Mexican or Mexican-American—is highly aspirational. They don’t settle. They want better lives for themselves and their children. They want success. They don’t hate Trump. They want to be Trump.', 'In states like Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Utah, and others, far away from the nation’s power triangle (New York-Boston-Washington), there were many average Latinos living ordinary lives who are being drawn to Trump and his promise to ""Make America Great Again."" Like many other Americans who are flocking to the real estate mogul, these Latinos want to know what it’s like to live in a country that is always winning and winning.', 'And what about Trump’s inflammatory comments about Mexico and immigration along our southern border?', 'It’s complicated. While generally more appreciative than other Americans of immigration, respectful of the contributions of legal and illegal immigrants, and supportive of a comprehensive reform plan that provides the undocumented with a path to earned legal status, many Latinos are also ambivalent about illegal immigration—especially if they, or their ancestors, came legally.', 'They’re leery of immigrants who abuse the system and feel entitled to make demands of the country that took them in, while waving the flag of the country that cast them adrift. They’re also fed up with what they see as a new militancy among the undocumented immigrants of today—particularly young DREAM’ers who were brought here as children and seem to understand everything about this country except what it demands of its citizens and those who aspire to be citizens.', 'Like Trump, these Latino voters know something is wrong with the nation’s immigration system. They might not agree with his proposed solutions, but they’re not going to hold against him the fact that he’s brave enough to start the discussion. Besides, when Trump blasts Mexican immigrants as criminals, many Latinos just assume he’s talking about someone else.', 'Meanwhile, we shouldn’t be terribly surprised that the chattering class completely missed the ""Latinos for Trump"" story. Much of it fell into their blind spot.', 'The East Coast media don’t get Latinos. Neither do the political parties. Ditto for most commentators, pundits, and political strategists. In fact, just about everyone with an opinion has the wrong opinion about Latinos.', 'For instance, they all seem to think that Latinos are demanding from government and other institutions that they be siphoned off into their own separate group and showered with preferential treatment and special accommodations. Not true.', 'Latinos don’t want to apart from America, and they aren’t in conflict with America. They are the essence of America.']","Yes, Donald Trump Won Latinos Over Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.

When comparing Jesus and Kanye on Twitter, the first question is what terms should we use for the comparison?"", 'There are a lot terms Twitter users use to reference Jesus: there\'s the broad ""Jesus,"" which includes other people named Jesus, the more specific ""Jesus Christ"" and foreign language versions -- Jesucristo in Spanish, gesù cristo in Italian. Some users also tag the name, resulting in mentions for @Jesus.', 'There are a lot fewer version of ""Kanye."" ""Kanye,"" which includes other people named Kanye (though there are far less people named Kanye than Jesus), ""Kanye West"" and @kanyewest. (There are also nominal instances of people tweeting his nicknames, like Yeezy and \'Ye.)', 'Since Jesus doesn\'t have a genuine Twitter account, and Kanye has a habit of deleting all of his tweets, using @ mentions didn\'t seem that promising or fair. Looking to minimize instances of other people named Jesus and Kanye, we decided to start our search comparing ""Kanye West"" with ""Jesus Christ"":', 'According to the data, in the last year worldwide, looking at only original Tweets (no retweets, no replies), ""Jesus Christ"" had 3,936,585 mentions, while ""Kanye West"" had 4,541,349 mentions. Pretty impressive for the 36-year-old rapper.', ""While West's total was greater overall, on a typical day, Kanye didn't have more tweets than Jesus. Kanye's numbers were skewed by a few high mention days and his median tweets/day (9,981) were, in fact, lower than Jesus's median tweets/day (10,458). In fact, Jesus had more tweets on the majority of days (187 out of the 365 days in the year)."", 'So, using ""Kanye West"" vs ""Jesus Christ,"" their Twitter mentions are pretty close.', 'But what about the foreign language tweets? Kanye has an advantage with foreign language tweets, because countries with the Latin derived alphabets, as far as we know, refer to Kanye West as Kanye West while, as mentioned above, there are many different ways to reference Jesus.', 'Only looking at the United States offers a clearer picture. Although there are some residents in the U.S. who speak foreign languages, Jesus Christ is generally used as the identifier. Here, again using ""Kanye West"" vs ""Jesus Christ,"" Kanye had slightly more mentions overall, 2,429,931 to 2,224,895, but they were about equal when the day-to-day totals received consideration. Breaking it down state-by-state, some states tweeted more about Jesus (orange states) while other states tweeted more about Kanye (green states).', 'When did users tweet the most about Jesus and Kanye?', ""Kanye West's top five days:"", '1) 8/26/2013, 90,993 tweets. The day after his ""Blood on the Leaves"" performance at the VMAs', ""2) 12/31/2012, 70,701 tweets. New Years Eve. Kim Kardashian announces she's pregnant with West's baby."", '3) 9/27/2013, 58,608 tweets. West feuds with Kimmel on Twitter and gets in a confrontation with paparazzi.', '4) 6/18/2013, 51,012 tweets. The official release of his album ""Yeezus.""', ""5) 6/21/2013, 48192. The announcement of his baby's name: North West."", ""Jesus Christ's top five days:"", '1) 12/25/2012, 37,459 tweets: Christmas.', '2) 5/9/2013, 36,393 tweets: Ascension Thursday', '3) 3/31/2013, 35,955 tweets: Easter Sunday', '4) 3/29/2013, 29,576 tweets: Good Friday', ""5) 4/23/2013, 26,921 tweets: St. George's Day"", ""Jesus Christ's biggest day-of-the-week was Sunday, while Kanye's biggest day-of-the-week was Monday."", 'When you look at the stream of ""Jesus Christ"" tweets, you will quickly notice a complication: a large amount of the ""Jesus Christ"" tweets are idiomatic (""I just stubbed my toe. Jesus Christ! #notblessed"") and don\'t actually refer to the literal Jesus Christ. Usage of the exclamatory ""Jesus Christ"" is probably more popular among those who are at least exposed to Christianity, so it may still be a good signal for Jesus\'s popularity among the Twitterati. That being said, the idiomatic Jesus Christ doesn\'t directly refer to the person Jesus Christ, while Kanye West refers to the person Kanye in almost all cases, so if we\'re looking for an apples-to-apples comparison, then Jesus Christ\'s numbers are significantly smaller.', 'How much smaller? We looked at a sample of the hundred most recent tweets for ""Jesus Christ"" on Twitter using the Twitter search and found that 73 percent of uses of ""Jesus Christ"" were idiomatic, leaving 27 percent literal. This search occurred during a tense soccer match (lots of ""Jesus Christ"" exclamations) and is too small of a sample to offer definitive conclusions, but it signals that the idiomatic ""Jesus Christ"" is accounting for a significant portion of the examined mentions.', 'So what happens if you compare ""Jesus"" vs ""Kanye""? Jesus had significantly more tweets: Kanye had 10,412,097 tweets compared to Jesus\'s 51,724,902 tweets. Looking again at a sample of the hundred latest tweets to gauge what\'s going on, we see the following breakdown:', 'Idiomatic: 22%', 'Literal: 70%', ""Other Person's Name: 8%"", 'This sample is again too small to prove definitive, but even if only 25 percent of those tweets that contain the word Jesus refer to the religious figure, ""Jesus"" would still have more literal tweets than ""Kanye,"" and the proportion of tweets referring to Jesus appears to be much higher than that. We also haven\'t accounted for different names for Jesus in languages other than English. When you break it down by region, mentions of ""Jesus"" are more popular than ""Kanye"" pretty much everywhere.', 'So, it looks like Jesus is ""the most high"" on Twitter -- except for Justin Bieber, who trumps Jesus in popularity with 68,257,710 tweets for the search term ""Bieber"" during the same period.']",Is 'Kanye West' More Popular Than 'Jesus Christ'?,"Kanye West has used Jesus Christ in his art since ""Jesus Walks.""

The bill would allocate $19.5 billion in funds to NASA in 2017, but it has a critical mission for the space agency: send men to Mars.', 'Funds Are On The Way', 'It looks like Republican and Democratic senators alike are keen on safeguarding America’s space programs. With the potential chaos of a new president on the horizon, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation passed a bipartisan bill giving NASA $19.5 billion to continue working on a mission to Mars. It also includes support for the continuation of the program to send astronauts on private rockets to the International Space Station (ISS) from American soil no later than 2018.', '""We have seen in the past the importance of stability and predictability in NASA and space exploration – that whenever one has a change in administration, we have seen the chaos that can be caused by the cancellation of major programs,"" Republican Senator Ted Cruz, lead sponsor of the bill, ""We have seen in the past the importance of stability and predictability in NASA and space exploration – that whenever one has a change in administration, we have seen the chaos that can be caused by the cancellation of major programs,"" Republican Senator Ted Cruz, lead sponsor of the bill, commented . ""The impact in terms of jobs lost, the impact in terms of money wasted has been significant.""', 'The NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2016 includes an overall authorization level of $19.508 billion for fiscal year 2017, but it still needs to be passed by the Senate as a whole, of course. The budget allotted is the same as what was approved by House appropriators and a bit more than the version released by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Obama administration, likewise, proposed $19 billion in funding for NASA.', 'Credits: NASA', 'Making it rain, NASA-style', 'The Senate is not giving NASA money just for the sake of exploration. It is also a challenge, a mandate, actually. The bill requires that NASA make it an official goal to send crewed missions to Mars in the next 25 years.', 'The bill allocates funds for different components: $4.5 billion on exploration, nearly $5 billion for space operations, and $5.4 billion for science. It also does not scrap The bill allocates funds for different components: $4.5 billion on exploration, nearly $5 billion for space operations, and $5.4 billion for science. It also does not scrap NASA’s controversial plans to send men on asteroids and collect samples by 2021. It does, however, require the space agency to regularly send progress reports to Congress, justifying its $1.4 billion cost.', '""Fifty-five years after President Kennedy challenged the nation to put a man on the moon, the Senate is challenging NASA to put humans on Mars. The priorities that we’ve laid out for NASA in this bill mark the beginning of a new era of American spaceflight,"" said an optimistic Florida Sen.

In these videos, the kitties are usually eating, and their owners surreptitiously sneak up behind them, place the vegetable down, and wait for their pet to turn around.', 'According to IFLScience, the cats’ fearful reactions—which include jumping, running, or pawing at the long green vegetable—are likely due to the surprise element of having an unexpected object placed into their territory without notice. In short, you could likely replicate the experiment with any other vegetable. (Animal behavior specialists also have other theories, including that the cats might think the cucumber is a deadly snake or other predator.)', 'However, National Geographic reports that your cat’s fright is more harmful than hilarious. While the cucumber isn’t stressful to you, it’s stressful to the cat. And since your pet usually has positive associations with the space surrounding its food bowl, you’re startling it while it’s in its comfort zone. In worst case scenarios, it can react by hurting itself, breaking a household object, or remaining anxious for days.', 'Bottom line? Slowly introduce new toys and objects to your cat, as they’re a source of mental stimulation.

K. Rowling. How did it work having three writers in the mix?', 'John Tiffany Jo Rowling was incredibly generous. I met her first, and I already had a soft spot for her because she used to write in the cafe of the Traverse Theater in Edinburgh when I was the director. It was only after the first book came out that I realized it had been her, nursing one cappuccino for four hours. When we met to talk about the play, she asked, ""What do you think the Harry Potter stories are about?"" I said, ""Learning to deal with death and grief."" There was something in her eye — I thought, we didn’t say it’s about transformation or magic or flying on brooms, and we’re on the right track.', 'Thorne We all met in Edinburgh and as the day developed, we knew we would take the epilogue of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" as a starting point.', 'Tiffany All the seeds are there; we start with that scene in the train station. Am I allowed to say that? Anyway, it was clear that she was going to let us take those characters and have our own ideas.', 'Callender Of course, Jack came to the table with an encyclopedic knowledge of Harry, so that helped.', 'Thorne All right, I’m a nerd. With abandonment issues.', 'Did you really sketch out the whole arc of the story in that first meeting?', 'Thorne Yes, but then it took about six months to really map the whole thing out. Every time it was like taking a big step forward, one or two small ones back. Jo would say, ""This feels right, this doesn’t.""', 'Tiffany There are parts of the story, which when we first conceived them, I didn’t think she would let us do, but she never hesitated. It is one thing to let us continue the story, another to let us unravel the canon.', 'Friedman That’s enough!', 'Was the idea of a two-part play there from the beginning?', 'Tiffany No, not at all. But we knew we had to deal with going beyond where the books left off, but also go back and look at the stories within them. We wanted to develop the characters that are already known and keep that consistency, but also introduce new ones. It was clearly hard to put an epic tale into two-and-a-half hours. We had a meeting and said, ""Why not two parts?"" And we knew right away how we wanted to end the first part. It’s a cliffhanger.', 'Noma Dumezweni It does that wonderful thing that books do when they work; it makes you desperate for more story.', 'How is it different telling that story as a play rather than a novel?', 'Thorne We can tell the story of the younger and older generation at the same time, which the books didn’t do. The exciting thing has been working out how those worlds fit together. It’s a coming-of-age story as much for the adults as for the children. John and I are more or less the same age as Harry in the play and I just had my first child, so there has been a lot of discussion about growing up, being a parent.', 'Tiffany How do you mother or father when you still need parenting yourself?', 'Dumezweni Also, I think the difference with a play is that you’re not experiencing the story on your own the way you do with a book. Being in the theater is a communal experience, and this play, with two parts, is a commitment. I’m fascinated to see what my daughter will think after a whole day in the theater. As an actor, it’s something I’ve never experienced before.', 'What about dealing with the issue of magic in the theater, where you can’t create the kind of effects that happen in film?', 'Tiffany Film has got green screen.

Is it intimidating?', 'Dumezweni I think Jamie found it very intimidating. [Everyone laughs.]', 'Parker It’s not so different from playing any role that is within a canon. You have the responsibility of being sensitive to the collective investment in the story. But you just have to try to serve the play the best way you can and not worry about that.', 'Dumezweni The weight of expectation is huge. But for me that pressure has been outweighed by getting text messages from mums I know saying how huge it is for their mixed-race daughters that I am playing Hermione. Ultimately it’s a theater piece, I’m a theater actor and doing a job as best I can.', 'Has it been difficult to work under conditions of intense secrecy? And what about when previews start and people are talking about the play online?', 'Callender I’m hopeful after seeing how people were about ""Star Wars."" They mostly protected the fans.', 'Tiffany It will be a relief when the text is published, when the play officially opens on July 30, so that it’s not our secret to keep. But if you don’t read it, and you choose not to read reviews, we’ve made it possible to come without prior knowledge.', 'Parker And you don’t get that much nowadays. So often things are ruined because you know so much.', 'Dumezweni I’ve quite loved the secrecy. Although, of course, my home life is [expletive]. My daughter tries to guess what is in the play. She says, ""Just smile at me if I’m right.""', 'Tiffany My mum is the only problem. Everyone else is fine.

dfd4f870-0370-4889-9e30-979c86a7aeee,4upivi,facebook is building apartments anyone can rent—but there's a huge catch,reddit,"['Image: Getty', 'Facebook could be your next landlord. In an effort to drum up support for the controversial expansion of its headquarters, the social media giant is trying to give back to the community by building at least 1,500 housing units that can be rented by the general public—not just Facebook employees.', 'But there’s a catch. As Facebook slowly wades into the real estate development business, the company is pushing an aggressive PR agenda to convince people that Facebook does not exacerbate income inequality in areas where it develops real estate. Facebook has pledged that 15 percent of the new units it creates will go to low- or middle-income families. Which is great until you realize that 85 percent of the building will probably be ridiculously expensive and probably populated by local tech bros.', 'Facebook has been embroiled in a fiery debate about income inequality for years. This January, the World Bank published a 330-page report showing how the largest technology companies are increasing income inequality rather than helping it. ""Some of the perceived benefits of digital technologies are offset by emerging risks,"" the report said. ""Many advanced economies face increasingly polarized labor markets and rising inequality—in part because technology augments higher skills while replacing routine jobs, forcing many workers to compete for low-paying jobs.""', 'That’s exactly what happened when Facebook attracted thousands of new residents into the Menlo Park area, where its headquarters is located. Most of the new residents are well-educated, high-income earners who drove up housing pricers, forced lower income families to move, and exacerbated income inequality throughout the area. Obviously, that doesn’t win Mark Zuckerberg many new friends in the area.', 'Meanwhile, Facebook is trying to win support for a lucrative proposal to expand its headquarters by 1.1 million square feet. The proposal is still missing some important details, though. For starters, it’s still unclear if Facebook itself will develop the buildings or hire a third party. Secondly, it’s also unclear what the timeline for the development is. Despite lacking specifics, the impact of the proposal is obvious: Facebook would dramatically increase its footprint in an area where it’s already driven up real estate prices and driven out those who can’t afford the rent.', 'Sponsored', 'This isn’t the first time Facebook has been involved in controversial housing development, either. In 2013, the company built a 394-unit housing community within walking distance of its offices that included its own sports bar, outdoor pool, and pet daycare.', 'At the time, a Wall Street Journal report referred to the project as being similar to a ""company town,"" the name for small communities built by robber barons of the 20th century that housed factory workers. The employers provided everything including health care, law enforcement, and even churches. Towns like Pullman, Illinois were created as ""capitalist utopias."" But ultimately, the bosses failed to protect workers and residents.', 'Is Facebook turning Menlo Park into a 21st century version of Pullman? It’s too soon to tell.

6a3a6fb2-e9a7-4040-b10b-4431aa8e6190,4ww3qr,why rio ratings are terrible,reddit,"['Michael Phelps. Photo: Adam Pretty', 'Critics and social media have predecessor. Critics and social media have savaged NBC ’s early coverage of the Rio Olympics — and the early ratings verdict from Nielsen has not been any kinder. Viewership for the first three nights of the Peacock’s prime-time broadcasts is down sharply compared to both the 2012 London and 2008 Beijing games, with younger audiences bailing in particularly big numbers. It’s not all bad news: Tens of millions of Americans are still watching the Olympics, some viewing has likely shifted to online platforms not immediately measured by Nielsen, and Sunday’s swimming-centric schedule resulted in a big ratings surge. But if the early pattern holds, Rio will be the first summer Olympics since Sydney 2000 to score lower Nielsen numbers than itspredecessor.', 'The first sign of trouble for NBC ’s Rio ratings came Saturday morning, when data for Friday’s never-ending opening ceremony came in. Per Nielsen, the minimalist curtain-raiser notched a 13.9 household rating (i.e., the percentage of homes with TV sets tuned to the Olympics). While that’s more than two times the audience for the typical episode of the summer’s No. 1 series, NBC ’s America’s Got Talent , it represents an eye-popping 35 percent drop from night one of the London games (which notched a 21.0 rating) and the lowest rating for an opening ceremony in at least 20 years. (The runner-up? Athens 2004, which averaged a 14.6 rating.) Worse, the 13.9 rating is just barely ahead of the average edition of NBC ’s Sunday Night Football last fall (12.9) rating.', 'Things didn’t improve much on Saturday, the first night of competition: NBC averaged an 11.4 for its prime-time broadcast, down about 28 percent from London’s 15.8 and another at least 20-year low. Part of the problem is big defections among millennial audiences, i.e. the audience segment most likely to be turned off by NBC ’s non-stop commercial breaks. Final numbers aren’t in yet, but among adults aged 18 to 34, it looks like Friday’s opening was down around 43 percent compared to London (versus the aforementioned 35 percent decline among viewers of all ages). Perhaps some of that audience shifted to NBC ’s livestream simulcast, but given how much of the network’s ad revenue is tied to linear ratings, that won’t be of much comfort to Peacock accountants. Still, expect NBC to play up big gains for digital and other platforms when it releases so-called ""total audience"" measurement data later this week.', 'It’s also far too early to declare Rio any sort of ratings disaster. NBC ’s Olympics ratings often rise and fall based on how well the U.S. team is doing at any given time, and Sunday’s stellar swimming performances by Katie Ledecky and Michael Phelps — telegraphed by social media ahead of their broadcast to American audiences — delivered a massive Nielsen boost for NBC . Early numbers show the network’s prime-time coverage jumping to a best-yet 15.9 household rating, the first time since Athens 2004 that a night three of the Olympics has come in ahead of the opening ceremonies. What’s more, while viewership was still down compared to London, it fell a more modest 20 percent and looks to be above tune-in for the comparable nights in both Athens and Sydney. If Team USA can keep winning, NBC still has a shot at making up some of the losses from the first weekend of the Games.']",Rio Olympics Ratings Are the Worst They’ve Been in Years,"If Team USA can keep winning, that may change.","2016 olympics, nbc, ratings","['http://archive.is/bmY5H/66841c4f2e7cf12a6ef4d920fc0b9ef431a81e4c.jpg', 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==', 'http://archive.is/bmY5H/9099b809706b56d6814cd46078aaa483ea619f20/scr.png', 'http://archive.is/bmY5H/ef35b2187b0f8b194e067a86c612cc4f85285bce.jpg', 'data:image/png;base64,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']",http://archive.is/bmY5H,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Too soon to tell, probably streaming', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}",['far too early to declare Rio any sort of ratings disaster'],"[[[4, 10], [4, 67]]]",['passage']

This year, however, the Russian Orthodox Church is doing something different."", ""It's formally celebrating St. Patrick's Day for the first time — but on March 30."", 'Earlier this month, the church announced it would finally recognize the day in commemoration of Saint Patrick, a missionary who had lived in the 5th century and is now widely known as the patron saint of Ireland. Orthodox leaders told the Russian media they hoped that recognizing Saint Patrick and a number of other western saints would show the shared roots of different branches of Christianity, before the Schism of 1054 that divided the faith into East and West.', ""Despite this, the divide between the two wings of Christianity means that the Russian Orthodox Church will not celebrate St. Patrick's Day along with the rest of the world. While the Catholic Church adopted the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century, the Russian Orthodox Church still uses the older Julian calendar. The two calendars are about two weeks out of sync."", ""This means that the day of St. Patrick's death — March 17 in the Gregorian calendar — falls on March 30 for the Russian Orthodox Church."", ""The March 30 date seems likely to extend Russia's St. Patrick's Day festivities rather than replace them. Russia has held events celebrating the day since the fall of communism. More than 15,000 people are expected to attend this year's official parade in Moscow, which will take place on March 18; the parade itself is part of a larger spread of events related to Ireland that take place March 15 to 26."", 'In a statement given to the Govorit Moskva radio station, the Irish government said it was glad the Russian Orthodox Church had made the decision. ""We hope to see our friends in Moscow on all of our Irish events in the next two weeks,"" said Arthur Hendrick, consul at the Irish Embassy in Moscow.', ""For members of the Orthodox faith, celebrating two St. Patrick's days may not be an option: March 17 falls in the middle of the Orthodox observance of Lent, when many religious Russians abstain from alcohol.

96783dee-d512-46a9-b260-44d23369079d,4qrru3,why brock turner is not actually a rapist,reddit,"['There has been widespread outrage at the six-month sentence handed down to American student There has been widespread outrage at the six-month sentence handed down to American student Brock Turner , following his conviction for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. A compelling, haunting description by the victim of her experience has been read millions of times online after being released by the district attorney – its power so at odds with the court’s apparent leniency.', 'Around the world outraged headlines have referred to the ""Brock Turner rape case"". And that’s quite accurate – he was originally charged with rape of an intoxicated person and rape of an unconscious person. But those indictments were dropped at a preliminary hearing, reportedly after prosecutors received the results of DNA testing.', 'As such, the case continued on the basis of ‘lesser’ charges: assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person; penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object; and penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object. In essence, Californian state law defines rape as penetration by the penis. Since that did not occur Turner is a criminal, a sex offender – but he isn’t, according to the law, a rapist.', '\ue001 \ue001 Play Current Time 0:00 / Duration Time 0:00 Remaining Time -0:00 Stream Type LIVE Loaded : 0% Progress : 0% 00:00 \ue000 Fullscreen Playback Rate 1 \ue00c Subtitles subtitles off \ue008 Captions captions settings', 'captions settings captions off \ue00c Chapters Chapters \ue006 Mute 00:00 \ue805 Share Foreground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque Background --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Window --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Font Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400% Text Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow Font Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps Defaults Done \ue800 Close Share Video: Share via: \ue801 Facebook', '\ue802 Google+', '\ue803 Twitter', '\ue804 tumblr', '\ue806 Pinterest', '\ue807 LinkedIn Start From: Direct Link: Embed Code: \ue808 Restart ‘Heroic’ Swedish student who stopped Stanford rape describes what he saw', 'It is notable that America’s Federal Bureau of Investigations defines rape differently, as ""penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object...without the consent of the victim"". That reflects the trend in state laws, although there remains considerable variation between jurisdictions, both with regard to the terminology used and the ranking of distinct types of sexual assault as to their seriousness. California is among a handful of states which continue to criminalise ‘object penetration’ to a lesser degree than penile penetration.', 'Even so, Turner’s crimes could have seen him receive a maximum of 14 years in prison. Even putting aside the precise definition of his conviction, it is no wonder that his six month sentence has received such criticism.', 'Under English law, Turner wouldn’t be classified as a rapist either. As in California, the offence of rape is strictly confined to a man penetrating another person with his penis in the absence of consent. That is why a woman cannot be convicted of rape except in circumstances where she assists a man to commit the crime.', '\ue607 Countries where sexual violence has become a way of life \ue612 \ue611', '\ue607 19 show all \ue603 \ue607 Countries where sexual violence has become a way of life', '\ue612 \ue611 1/19 Afghanistan Recommendation: I urge the Government of Afghanistan to adopt legislative reforms to ensure that sexual violence offences are not conflated with adultery or ""morality crimes"" and to establish infrastructure for the delivery of protection, health and le gal services to survivors. I call on the Ministry of the Interior to accelerate efforts to integrate women into the Afghan National Police, thereby enhancing its outreach and its capacity to address sexual and gender-based violence', '2/19 Central African Republic Recommendation: I urge the authorities of the Central African Republic to ensure that efforts to restore security and the rule of law take into account the prevention of sexual violence and that monitoring of the ceasefire and peace agreement explicitly reflects this consideration, in line with the joint communiqué of the Government and the United Nations on the prevention of and response to conflict-related sexual violence signed in December 2012.

I encourage the authorities to implement Law 1719 and continue to prosecute cases of sexual violence committed during the conflict to ensure that survivors receive justice and receive reparations. Conflict-related sexual violence should continue to be addressed in the Havana peace talks, as well as in the resulting accords and transitional justice mechanisms. Particular attention should be paid to groups that face additional barriers to justice such as ethnic minorities, women in rural areas, children, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals and women abused within the ranks of armed groups. I encourage the Government to scale up its protection measures and share its good practices with other conflict-affected countries', '4/19 Congo Recommendation: I urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to ensure full implementation of the armed forces action plan against sexual violence, to systematically bring perpetrators to justice and to deliver reparations to victims, including payment of outstanding compensation awards. I call on donors and the United Nations system to support the Government in its efforts and to pay increased attention to neglected areas, including unregulated mining regions', '5/19 Iraq Recommendation: I commend the Government of Iraq for its national action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and urge its swift implementation, including by training its security forces to ensur e respect for women’s rights. Programmes to support the social reintegration of women and girls released from captivity by ISIL are urgently needed, as is community-based medical and psychological care. The capacity of the United Nations system should be enhanced through the deployment of Women’s Protection Advisers or equivalent specialists', '6/19 Libya Recommendation: I urge the national authorities in Libya to implement Decree No. 119 and Resolution 904 of 2014 to ensure redress for all victims, including those affected by the current conflict, through the establishment of multisectoral services and the adoption of legislation to categorically prohibit sexual violence', '7/19 Mali Recommendation: I urge the Government of Mali, with support from United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict, to develop a comprehensive national strategy to combat sexual and gender-based violence and to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers so that services can reach remote areas. I further call on all parties to ensure that conflict-related sexual violence is addressed in the inter-Malian dialogue and that perpetrators of sexual violence do not benefit from amnesty or early release', '8/19 Myanmar Recommendation: I urge the Government of Myanmar to continue with its reform agenda and, in the process, take practical and timely actions to protect and support survivors of conflict-related sexual violence and to ensure that security personnel accused of such crimes are prosecuted. Sexual violence should be an element in all ceasefire and peace negotiations, excluded from the scope of amnesty provisions and addressed in transitional justice processes.

I call upon the Government of South Sudan to address the negative impact of customary law on women’s rights and to reflect international human rights standards in national law. I also encourage the African Union to make public and act upon the report of its Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan', '11/19 Sudan (Darfur) Recommendation: I call upon the Government of the Sudan to grant the United Nations and its humanitarian partners unfettered access for monitoring and the provision of assistance to people in need in Darfur. Given that there has been grave concern over sexual violence in Darfur for more than a decade, I encourage the Government to engage with my Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict to develop a framework of cooperation to address the issue comprehensively', '12/19 Syria Recommendation: I acknowledge the Government’s invitation to my Special Representative to visit the Syrian Arab Republic and call upon the authorities, in the context of such a visit, to agree on specific measures to prevent sexual violence, including by members of the security forces. I condemn the use of sexual violence by ISIL and all other parties listed in the annex to the present report and call on them to cease such violations immediately and allow unfettered access for the delivery of humanitarian assistance', '13/19 Yemen Recommendation: I urge the authorities in Yemen to undertake legislative reform as a basis for addressing impunity for sexual violence, ensuring the provision of services for survivors and aligning the minimum legal age of marriage with international standards. I further call on the authorities to engage with local community and faithbased leaders to address sexual and gender-based violence and discriminatory social norms', '14/19 Bosnia and Herzegovina Recommendation: I urge the relevant authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to harmonize legislation and policies so that the rights of survivors of conflict-related sexual violence to reparations are consistently recognized and to allocate a specific budget for this purpose. I further call upon the authorities to protect and support survivors participating in judicial proceedings through, inter alia, referrals to free legal aid, psychosocial and health services, as well as economic empowerment programmes', '15/19 Ivory Coast Recommendation: I urge the Government of Côte d’Ivoire to ensure the effective implementation of its national strategy to combat gender-based violence and the action plan for FRCI, and call on the international community to support these efforts. It is critical to accelerate disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and strengthen law enforcement to ensure that ex-combatants who have been reintegrated into the transport sector do not pose a risk to women and girls who are reliant on those services. The Government and the international community must provide monitoring and awareness-raising to mitigate the possibility of a recurrence of sexual violence in the context of the presidential elections to be held in October 2015', '16/19 Liberia Recommendation: I call on the Government of Liberia to continue its critical efforts to combat sexual and gender-based violence including through the United Nations-Government of Liberia Joint Programme, and in the context of recovery from the Ebola virus epidemic', '17/19 Nepal Recommendation: I encourage the Government to ensure that survivors of conflict-related sexual violence are recognized under the law as ""conflict victims"", which will enable them to access services, judicial remedies and reparations. I further call on all parties involved in the transitional justice process to ensure that the rights and needs o f survivors of sexual violence are addressed in institutional reforms and that these crimes are excluded from amnesties and statutes of limitations', '18/19 Sri Lanka Recommendation: I call upon the newly elected Government of Sri Lanka to investigate allegations of sexual violence, including against national armed and security forces, and to provide multisectoral services for survivors, including reparations and economic empowerment programmes for women at risk, including war widows and female heads of household', '19/19 Nigeria Recommendation: I encourage the Government to implement its national action plan on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) to ensure that women’s protection concerns are mainstreamed throughout its security operations. I also call upon the authorities to guarantee security in and around internally displaced persons camps and to extend medical and psychosocial services to high-risk areas', 'Whether existing definitions are appropriate entirely depends on your point of view of course. It is not an awfully long time ago that rape was regarded fundamentally not as a crime of violence against women, but as a crime against the property of men (ie their wives or daughters), which is why marital rape was for so long excluded. We have – for the most part – moved on from the deepest depths of that patriarchal approach but there any many who argue that the maintenance of ‘phallo-centric’ rape definitions means that the seriousness of other forms of penetrative assault are underplayed.', 'Brock Turner’s conviction, and the bravely stark testimony of his victim, have helped to bring these questions about how sexual crimes are defined – and how that impacts on attitudes towards sentencing – out into the open. The tragedy is that no level of public debate or outrage can undo the despicable harm he caused to an unconscious woman.', ""Read the Stanford victim's full impact statement"", 'Your honor,', 'If it is all right, for the majority of this statement I would like to address the defendant directly.', 'You don’t know me, but you’ve been inside me, and that’s why we’re here today.', 'On January 17th, 2015, it was a quiet Saturday night at home. My dad made some dinner and I sat at the table with my younger sister who was visiting for the weekend. I was working full time and it was approaching my bed time. I planned to stay at home by myself, watch some TV and read, while she went to a party with her friends. Then, I decided it was my only night with her, I had nothing better to do, so why not, there’s a dumb party ten minutes from my house, I would go, dance weird like a fool, and embarrass my younger sister. On the way there, I joked that undergrad guys would have braces. My sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian. I called myself ""big mama"", because I knew I’d be the oldest one there. I made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college.', 'The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing. I still remember the feeling of my hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing. I looked down and there was nothing. The thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside me was silenced. I still don’t have words for that feeling. In order to keep breathing, I thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidence.', 'Then, I felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair. I thought maybe, the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head. My brain was talking my gut into not collapsing. Because my gut was saying, help me, help me.', 'I shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me, pine needles trailing behind me, I left a little pile in every room I sat in. I was asked to sign papers that said ""Rape Victim"" and I thought something has really happened. My clothes were confiscated and I stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them. The three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair, six hands to fill one paper bag. To calm me down, they said it’s just the flora and fauna, flora and fauna. I had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a nikon pointed right into my spread legs. I had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions.', 'After a few hours of this, they let me shower. I stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, I don’t want my body anymore. I was terrified of it, I didn’t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else.', 'On that morning, all that I was told was that I had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that I should get retested for HIV because results don’t always show up immediately. But for now, I should go home and get back to my normal life. Imagine stepping back into the world with only that information. They gave me huge hugs, and then I walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoes.', 'My sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish. Instinctively and immediately, I wanted to take away her pain. I smiled at her, I told her to look at me, I’m right here, I’m okay, everything’s okay, I’m right here. My hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me. Look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, I look like a P.E. teacher, let’s go home, let’s eat something. She did not know that beneath my sweats, I had scratches and bandages on my skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and I felt too empty to continue to speak. That I was also afraid, that I was also devastated. That day we drove home and for hours my sister held me.', 'My boyfriend did not know what happened, but called that day and said, ""I was really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you make it home okay?"" I was horrified. That’s when I learned I had called him that night in my blackout, left an incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the phone, but I was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, that he repeatedly told me to go find my sister. Again, he asked me, ""What happened last night? Did you make it home okay?"" I said yes, and hung up to cry.', 'I was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually, I may have been raped behind a dumpster, but I don’t know by who or when or how. If I told them, I would see the fear on their faces, and mine would multiply by tenfold, so instead I pretended the whole thing wasn’t real.', 'I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone. After work, I would drive to a secluded place to scream. I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone, and I became isolated from the ones I loved most. For one week after the incident, I didn’t get any calls or updates about that night or what happened to me. The only symbol that proved that it hadn’t just been a bad dream, was the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer.', 'One day, I was at work, scrolling through the news on my phone, and came across an article. In it, I read and learned for the first time about how I was found unconscious, with my hair disheveled, long necklace wrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that I was butt naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognize. This was how I learned what happened to me, sitting at my desk reading the news at work. I learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me. That’s when the pine needles in my hair made sense, they didn’t fall from a tree. He had taken off my underwear, his fingers had been inside of me. I don’t even know this person. I still don’t know this person. When I read about me like this, I said, this can’t be me.', 'This can’t be me. I could not digest or accept any of this information. I could not imagine my family having to read about this online. I kept reading. In the next paragraph, I read something that I will never forgive; I read that according to him, I liked it. I liked it. Again, I do not have words for these feelings.', 'At the bottom of the article, after I learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assault, the article listed his swimming times. She was found breathing, unresponsive with her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position. By the way, he’s really good at swimming. Throw in my mile time if that’s what we’re doing. I’m good at cooking, put that in there, I think the end is where you list your extra-curriculars to cancel out all the sickening things that’ve happened.', 'The night the news came out I sat my parents down and told them that I had been assaulted, to not look at the news because it’s upsetting, just know that I’m okay, I’m right here, and I’m okay. But halfway through telling them, my mom had to hold me because I could no longer stand up. I was not okay.', 'The night after it happened, he said he didn’t know my name, said he wouldn’t be able to identify my face in a lineup, didn’t mention any dialogue between us, no words, only dancing and kissing. Dancing is a cute term; was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing, or just bodies grinding up against each other in a crowded room? I wonder if kissing was just faces sloppily pressed up against each other? When the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm, he said no. When the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster, he said he didn’t know. He admitted to kissing other girls at that party, one of whom was my own sister who pushed him away. He admitted to wanting to hook up with someone. I was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me. Sometimes I think, if I hadn’t gone, then this never would’ve happened. But then I realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else. You were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue.', 'The night after it happened, he said he thought I liked it because I rubbed his back. A back rub. Never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us speaking, a back rub.', 'One more time, in public news, I learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don’t remember, so how do I prove I didn’t like it.', 'I thought there’s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. He’s going to settle, formally apologize, and we will both move on. Instead, I was told he hired a powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact a misunderstanding. That he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused.', 'I was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn’t remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me. It is the saddest type of confusion to be told I was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don’t know if it counts as assault yet. I had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation.', 'When I was told to be prepared in case we didn’t win, I said, I can’t prepare for that. He was guilty the minute I woke up. No one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me. Worst of all, I was warned, because he now knows you don’t remember, he is going to get to write the script. He can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it. I had no power, I had no voice, I was defenseless. My memory loss would be used against me. My testimony was weak, was incomplete, and I was made to believe that perhaps, I am not enough to win this. That’s so damaging. His attorney constantly reminded the jury, the only one we can believe is Brock, because she doesn’t remember. That helplessness was traumatizing.', 'Instead of taking time to heal, I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney’s questions that would be invasive, aggressive, and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers. Instead of his attorney saying, Did you notice any abrasions? He said, You didn’t notice any abrasions, right? This was a game of strategy, as if I could be tricked out of my own worth. The sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here I was at the trial, answering question like:', 'How old are you? How much do you weigh? What did you eat that day? Well what did you have for dinner? Who made dinner? Did you drink with dinner? No, not even water? When did you drink? How much did you drink? What container did you drink out of? Who gave you the drink? How much do you usually drink? Who dropped you off at this party? At what time? But where exactly? What were you wearing? Why were you going to this party? What’d you do when you got there? Are you sure you did that? But what time did you do that? What does this text mean? Who were you texting? When did you urinate? Where did you urinate? With whom did you urinate outside? Was your phone on silent when your sister called? Do you remember silencing it? Really because on page 53 I’d like to point out that you said it was set to ring. Did you drink in college? You said you were a party animal? How many times did you black out? Did you party at frats? Are you serious with your boyfriend? Are you sexually active with him? When did you start dating? Would you ever cheat? Do you have a history of cheating? What do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? Do you remember what time you woke up? Were you wearing your cardigan? What color was your cardigan? Do you remember any more from that night? No? Okay, we’ll let Brock fill it in.', 'I was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who didn’t even take the time to ask me for my name, who had me naked a handful of minutes after seeing me. After a physical assault, I was assaulted with questions designed to attack me, to say see, her facts don’t line up, she’s out of her mind, she’s practically an alcoholic, she probably wanted to hook up, he’s like an athlete right, they were both drunk, whatever, the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact, why take it into account, Brock has a lot at stake so he’s having a really hard time right now.', 'And then it came time for him to testify. This is where I became revictimized. I want to remind you, the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm. He said he didn’t know why we were behind a dumpster. He got up to leave because he wasn’t feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked. Then he learned I could not remember.', 'So one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged. Brock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent. One year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so.', 'He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He’d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don’t ask, Can I finger you? Usually there’s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He’s in the clear.', 'Even in this story, there’s barely any dialogue; I only said a total of three words before he had me half naked on the ground. I have never been penetrated after three words. He didn’t claim to hear me speak one full sentence that night, so in the news when it says we ""met"", I’m not sure I would go so far as to say that. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn’t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. If she can’t do that, then no. Don’t touch her, just no. Not maybe, just no. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency.', 'According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don’t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that’s why she wore the cardigan. If her bare ass and legs are rubbing the pinecones and needles, while the weight of you pushes into her, get off her.', 'Next in the story, two people approached you. You ran because you said you felt scared. I argue that you were scared because you’d be caught, not because you were scared of two terrifying Swedish grad students. The idea that you thought you were being attacked out of the blue was ludicrous. That it had nothing to do with you being on top my unconscious body. You were caught red handed, with no explanation. When they tackled you why didn’t [you] say, ""Stop! Everything’s okay, go ask her, she’s right over there, she’ll tell you."" I mean you had just asked for my consent, right? I was awake, right? When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn’t speak because of what he’d seen. Also, if you really did think they were dangerous, you just abandoned a half-naked girl to run and save yourself. No matter which way you frame it, it doesn’t make sense.', 'Your attorney has repeatedly pointed out, well we don’t know exactly when she became unconscious. And you’re right, maybe I was still fluttering my eyes and wasn’t completely limp yet, fine. His guilt did not depend on him knowing the exact second that I became unconscious, that is never what this was about. I was slurring, too drunk to consent way before I was on the ground. I should have never been touched in the first place. Brock stated, ""At no time did I see that she was not responding. If at any time I thought she was not responding, I would have stopped immediately."" Here’s the thing; if your plan was to stop only when I was literally unresponsive, then you still do not understand. You didn’t even stop when I was unconscious anyway! Someone else stopped you. Two guys on bikes noticed I wasn’t moving in the dark and had to tackle you. How did you not notice while on top of me?', 'You said, you would have stopped and gotten help. You say that, but I want you to explain how you would’ve helped me, step by step, walk me through this. I want to know, if those evil Swedes had not found me, how the night would have played out. I am asking you; Would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boots? Untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck? Closed my legs, covered me? Tucked my bra back into my dress? Would you have helped me pick the needles from my hair? Asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt? Would you then go find a friend and say, Will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft? I don’t sleep when I think about the way it could have gone if the Swedes had never come. What would have happened to me? That’s what you’ll never have a good answer for, that’s what you can’t explain even after a year.', 'To sit under oath and inform all of us, that yes I wanted it, yes I permitted it, and that you are the true victim attacked by guys for reasons unknown to you is sick, is demented, is selfish, is stupid. It shows that you were willing to go to any length, to discredit me, invalidate me, and explain why it was okay to hurt me. You tried unyieldingly to save yourself, your reputation, at my expense.', 'My family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles, of my body in the dirt with my eyes closed, dress hiked up, limbs limp in the dark. And then even after that, my family had to listen to your attorney say, the pictures were after the fact, we can dismiss them. To say, yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her, but that’s what happens when you finger someone, and he’s already admitted to that. To listen to him use my own sister against me. To listen him attempt to paint of a picture of me, the seductive party animal, as if somehow that would make it so that I had this coming for me. To listen to him say I sounded drunk on the phone because I’m silly and that’s my goofy way of speaking. To point out that in the voicemail, I said I would reward my boyfriend and we all know what I was thinking. I assure you my rewards program is non-transferable, especially to any nameless man that approaches me.', 'The point is, this is everything my family and I endured during the trial. This is everything I had to sit through silently, taking it, while he shaped the evening. It is enough to be suffering. It is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity and validity of this suffering. But in the end, his unsupported statements and his attorney’s twisted logic fooled no one. The truth won, the truth spoke for itself.', 'You are guilty. Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt, that’s twelve votes per count, thirty-six yeses confirming guilt, that’s one hundred percent, unanimous guilt. And I thought finally it is over, finally he will own up to what he did, truly apologize, we will both move on and get better. Then I read your statement.', 'If you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and I will die, I’m almost there. You are very close. Assault is not an accident. This is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making. Somehow, you still don’t get it. Somehow, you still sound confused.', 'I will now take this opportunity to read portions of the defendant’s statement and respond to them.', 'You said, Being drunk I just couldn’t make the best decisions and neither could she.', 'Alcohol is not an excuse. Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. Having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit to, but it is not criminal. Everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much. Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. That’s the difference.', 'You said, If I wanted to get to know her, I should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room.', 'I’m not mad because you didn’t ask for my number. Even if you did know me, I would not want [to] be in this situation. My own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster, I would slap him. No girl wants to be in this situation. Nobody. I don’t care if you know their phone number or not.', 'You said, I stupidly thought it was okay for me to do what everyone around me was doing, which was drinking. I was wrong.', 'Again, you were not wrong for drinking. Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. You were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing, which was pushing your erect dick in your pants against my naked, defenseless body concealed in a dark area, where partygoers could no longer see or protect me, and own my sister could not find me. Sipping fireball is not your crime. Peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body, is where you went wrong. Why am I still explaining this.', 'You said, During the trial I didn’t want to victimize her at all. That was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case.', 'Your attorney is not your scapegoat, he represents you. Did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating, degrading things? Absolutely. He said you had an erection, because it was cold. I have no words.', 'You said, you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which you speak about your experience to ""speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that.""', 'Speak out against campus drinking culture. That’s what we’re speaking out against? You think that’s what I’ve spent the past year fighting for? Not awareness about campus sexual assault, or rape, or learning to recognize consent. Campus drinking culture. Down with Jack Daniels. Down with Skyy Vodka. If you want talk to high school kids about drinking go to an AA meeting. You realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone? Show men how to respect women, not how to drink less.', 'Drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Goes along with that, like a side effect, like fries on the side of your order. Where does promiscuity even come into play? I don’t see headlines that read, Brock Turner, Guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Campus [Sexual] Assault. There’s your first powerpoint slide.', 'I have done enough explaining. You do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore. You do not get to pretend that there were no red flags. You do not get to not know why you ran. You have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things. Figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct.', 'Lastly you said, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life.', 'Ruin a life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine. Let me rephrase for you, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again. You knocked down both our towers, I collapsed at the same time you did. Your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.', 'See one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning. I am no stranger to suffering. You made me a victim. In newspapers my name was ""unconscious intoxicated woman"", ten syllables, and nothing more than that. For a while, I believed that that was all I was. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am. That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the All-American swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty, with so much at stake. I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt, who waited a year to figure out if I was worth something.', 'My independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition. I became closed off, angry, self-deprecating, tired, irritable, empty. The isolation at times was unbearable. You cannot give me back the life I had before that night either. While you worry about your shattered reputation, I refrigerated spoons every night so when I woke up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, I would hold the spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that I could see. I showed up an hour late to work every morning, excused myself to cry in the stairwells, I can tell you all the best places in that building to cry where no one can hear you, the pain became so bad that I had to tell my boss I was leaving, I needed time because continuing day to day was not possible. I used my savings to go as far away as I could possibly be.', 'I can’t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up, I did this thing where I waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to sleep. For three months, I went to bed at six o’clock in the morning.', 'I used to pride myself on my independence, now I am afraid to go on walks in the evening, to attend social events with drinking among friends where I should be comfortable being. I have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone’s side, to have my boyfriend standing next to me, sleeping beside me, protecting me. It is embarrassing how feeble I feel, how timidly I move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry.', 'You have no idea how hard I have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak. It took me eight months to even talk about what happened. I could no longer connect with friends, with everyone around me. I would scream at my boyfriend, my own family whenever they brought this up. You never let me forget what happened to me. At the of end of the hearing, the trial, I was too tired to speak. I would leave drained, silent. I would go home turn off my phone and for days I would not speak. You bought me a ticket to a planet where I lived by myself. Every time a new article [would] come out, I lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me as the girl who got assaulted. I didn’t want anyone’s pity and am still learning to accept victim as part of my identity. You made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be.', 'Someday, you can pay me back for my ambulance ride and therapy. But you cannot give me back my sleepless nights. The way I have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if I’m watching a movie and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has expanded my empathy for other victims. I have lost weight from stress, when people would comment I told them I’ve been running a lot lately. There are times I did not want to be touched. I have to relearn that I am not fragile, I am capable, I am wholesome, not just livid and weak.', 'I want to say this. All the crying, the hurting you have imposed on me, I can take it. But when I see my younger sister hurting, when she is unable to keep up in school, when she is deprived of joy, when she is not sleeping, when she is crying so hard on the phone she is barely breathing, telling me over and over she is sorry for leaving me alone that night, sorry sorry sorry, when she feels more guilt than you, then I do not forgive you. That night I had called her to try and find her, but you found me first. Your attorney’s closing statement began, ""My sister said she was fine and who knows her better than her sister."" You tried to use my own sister against me. Your points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing. You do not touch her.', 'If you think I was spared, came out unscathed, that today I ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken. Nobody wins. We have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering.', 'You should have never done this to me. Secondly, you should have never made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me. But here we are. The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on.', 'Your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story. The world is huge, it is so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy. Right now your name is tainted, so I challenge you to make a new name for yourself, to do something so good for the world, it blows everyone away. You have a brain and a voice and a heart. Use them wisely. You possess immense love from your family. That alone can pull you out of anything. Mine has held me up through all of this. Yours will hold you and you will go on.', 'I believe, that one day, you will understand all of this better. I hope you will become a better more honest person who can properly use this story to prevent another story like this from ever happening again. I fully support your journey to healing, to rebuilding your life, because that is the only way you’ll begin to help others.', 'Now to address the sentencing. When I read the probation officer’s report, I was in disbelief, consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness. My statements have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context. I fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions I had about the legal system. The context is also important. Brock had yet to issue a statement, and I had not read his remarks.', 'My life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured. Had Brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, I would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward. Instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public. He pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice.', 'I told the probation officer I do not want Brock to rot away in prison. I did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars. The probation officer’s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft time-out, a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, and of the consequences of the pain I have been forced to endure. I also told the probation officer that what I truly wanted was for Brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing.', 'Unfortunately, after reading the defendant’s statement, I am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct. I fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence. It is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity. By definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can’t even see that distinction.', 'The probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions. In my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong. When you are eighteen in this country you can go to war. When you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone. He is young, but he is old enough to know better.', 'As this is a first offense I can see where leniency would beckon. On the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone’s first sexual assault or digital rape. It doesn’t make sense. The seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error. The consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative. The fact that Brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class.', 'The probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship. If I had been sexually assaulted by an un-athletic guy from a community college, what would his sentence be? If a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? How fast he swims does not lessen the impact of what happened to me.', 'The Probation Officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant’s level of intoxication. It felt serious. That’s all I’m going to say.', 'He is a lifetime sex registrant. That doesn’t expire. Just like what he did to me doesn’t expire, doesn’t just go away after a set number of years. It stays with me, it’s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life.', 'A year has gone by and he has had lots of time on his hands. Has he been seeing a psychologist? What has he done in this past year to show he’s been progressing? If he says he wants to implement programs, what has he done to show for it?', 'Throughout incarceration I hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resources to rebuild his life. I request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault. I hope he accepts proper punishment and pushes himself to reenter society as a better person.', 'To conclude, I want to say thank you. To everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into strength, to my friends who remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart, to Alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never doubted me. Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention. Thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me.', 'Most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who I have yet to meet. I sleep with two bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story. That we are looking out for one another. To have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something I will never forget.', 'And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining. Although I can’t save every boat, I hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can’t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you.

Ortuzar, who was then one of the chefs at Craft, ""was known for doing these great sandwiches after work and said hey, let’s do a sandwich restaurant. And that’s how \'Wichcraft was born,"" Colicchio told The Feast. Over the years, that little sandwich shop has grown into a ubiquitous chain—which just opened its ninth branch and is opening its tenth in Grand Central this fall—thanks to Colicchio and Ortuzar\'s knack for creating some of the most thrilling ingredient-driven sandwiches, soups and lunch offerings in NYC.', 'Tom Colicchio (right) with Sisha Ortuzar.', 'Still, as Colicchio himself admits, sometimes those lunch orders could take a little longer to prepare than a rushed and hungry customer might like. Now, with its brand-new location in Tribeca, Colicchio says the reconceived kitchen set-up will let the orders come out ""much faster."" Its sandwiches, like the phenomenal BLT, will take an average of ""five minutes as opposed to 12-13 minutes,"" Colicchio said. The tweaking and rebranding of \'Wichcraft will soon spread to all shops in the chain, and Colicchio said he\'s hoping to expand \'Wichcraft to other cities in the near future. In the meantime, anyone who won\'t be visiting in person anytime soon can live vicariously through this must-try BLT recipe, which perfects the classic American sandwich.', 'The BLT is available starting August 1 at the new Tribeca location and all the \'Wichcraft shops. But for anyone trying the recipe at home, there\'s one crucial secret to making the sandwich come out perfectly, Colicchio says. ""If you’re gonna make a BLT, you have to have great tomatoes, in season and fresh. Otherwise don’t make it.""', ""'Wichcraft BLT; Photo credit: Peden + Munk."", ""If you're like us, you'll be whipping up this sandwich multiple times a week, all the way through tomato season. In New York, that's typically August until early September, and that's the only time you'll find this BLT on 'Wichcraft's menu. (The sandwich shops use Eckerton Hill Farms tomatoes from the Union Square Greenmarket, along with Berkshire bacon.) After the season is over, it's not just the tomatoes that'll be gone. The sandwich will vanish too."", ""'Wichcraft BLT Recipe:"", 'Makes 4 sandwiches', '1 pound ripe heirloom or beefsteak tomatoes, sliced 1⁄2-inch thick (Tip: Sit the tomato stem side down on the counter and using a very sharp knife, slice it horizontally to prevent the juices from running out.)', '1 pound thick-cut bacon', '4 large leaves of Bibb lettuce', '8 slices country bread', '4 tablespoons aioli (see recipe below)', 'Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper', 'For the BLT:', 'In a heavy skillet, over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until golden brown and crisp on both sides. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Toast the bread on one side only. Evenly spread the aioli on the toasted side of four slices of bread. Place the tomatoes on top of the aioli, making sure the slices don’t overlap and the surface of the bread is covered. Season the tomatoes with sea salt and pepper. Place the bacon over the tomatoes, followed by the lettuce. Close the sandwiches with the remaining four bread slices, toasted side down. Carefully cut into halves and serve.', 'For the aioli:', '1 large egg yolk, preferably from a pasture-raised egg', '1⁄2 teaspoon Dijon mustard', '1⁄2 teaspoon chopped garlic', 'Pinch of cayenne pepper', '1 tablespoon white wine vinegar', '1 cup grapeseed oil', '1⁄2 teaspoon kosher salt', 'Freshly ground black pepper', 'Place the egg yolk, mustard, garlic, cayenne pepper, and vinegar in a food processor or blender. Start the blender and slowly add the grapeseed oi in a thin, even stream. When half of the oil has been added, add 1 tablespoon water. Then slowly add the remaining grapeseed oil and blend until you have a smooth aioli. Season with the salt and pepper.

(Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post)', ""In 2012, voters in California approved a measure to raise taxes on millionaires, bringing their top state income tax rate to 13.3 percent, the highest in the nation. Conservative economists predicted calamity, or at least a big slowdown in growth. Also that year, the governor of Kansas signed a series of changes to the state's tax code, including reducing income and sales tax rates. Conservative economists predicted a boom."", 'Neither of those predictions came true. Not right away -- California grew just fine in the year the tax hikes took effect -- and especially not in the medium term, as new economic data showed this week.', 'Now, correlation does not, as they say, equal causation, and two examples are but a small sample. But the divergent experiences of California and Kansas run counter to a popular view, particularly among conservative economists, that tax cuts tend to supercharge growth and tax increases chill it.', ""California's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 2015, according to new numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, tying it with Oregon for the fastest state growth of the year. That was up from 3.1 percent growth for the Golden State in 2014, which was near the top of the national pack."", ""The Kansas economy, on the other hand, grew 0.2 percent in 2015. That's down from 1.2 percent in 2014, and below neighboring states such as Nebraska (2.1 percent) and Missouri (1.2 percent). Kansas ended the year with two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- a shrinking economy. By a common definition of the term, the state entered 2016 in recession."", '[Kansas had the ultimate plan to punish the poor]', 'Other effects of the Kansas tax cuts, which were meant to spur entrepreneurship, are well-documented.', 'While state officials anticipated that the reductions would create a shortfall in the state budget, tax revenues have been consistently below even those expectations. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service have signaled that they could reduce Kansas’s credit rating, indicating there is a chance the state cannot pay its bills.', 'The shortfalls have forced Gov. Sam Brownback (R) and lawmakers to make additional adjustments. The state canceled the initial reduction in sales taxes, then increased them again, while delaying additional scheduled reductions in the income tax.', 'On the whole, Brownback’s policies modestly increased taxes for the poor and working class, who pay more in sales taxes than income taxes, while reducing taxes drastically for the rich.', 'The poorest 20 percent of households -- those making less than $23,000 a year -- are paying about $200 more, on average, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington. For the middle class, the changes have been a wash, with less-affluent households paying somewhat more and more-affluent households giving up a little less.', 'Meanwhile, the wealthiest 1 percent of households, those making at least $493,000 a year, are saving an average of $25,000.', '[Bernie Sanders is right: The top 0.1 percent have as much as the bottom 90 percent]', 'Kansas’s gross domestic product is still less than it was at the end of 2011, said Menzie Chinn, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has been following Kansas’s economy. Meanwhile, the economy in the rest of the country continues to expand.', '""It’s remarkable,"" Chinn said.', ""It is perhaps less remarkable -- or surprising -- that California has powered along. The recovery nationwide has favored massive metropolitan areas stocked with high-skilled workers, which is to say places such as Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco. The damage from California's deep housing crash has slowly healed in places such as the Central Valley."", ""Still, the noncoastal regions of California lag far behind Silicon Valley and Los Angeles in their job and growth recoveries. The state's median income remains below pre-recession levels after adjustment for inflation, although it still beats the national average."", '[Will higher taxes on the rich derail California’s economic comeback?]', ""Few, if any, economists would say today that the recovery has been sufficient for all Californians. But almost no one can say that raising taxes on the rich killed that recovery.

This fantasy could keep me occupied for hours on end. The fantasizing continued up through college, even after I dropped out of music school and stopped playing seriously. But even then it was never a question of if I’d ever be up playing in front of screaming crowds, but when. I was biding my time before I could invest the proper amount of time and effort into getting out there and making it work. First, I needed to finish school. Then, I needed to make money. Then, I needed to find the time. Then ... and then nothing.', 'Despite fantasizing about this for over half of my life, the reality never came.

Alternatively upgrade to a modern browser.', 'Why would a set of supporters try to stop a game while their team is winning? And why would they then start a fight among themselves?', 'They are natural questions to ask, but not easy to answer. This is the background, though. A lot of people in Croatia have become alienated from the national team in recent years and there are large movements that have given up on it completely.', 'They claim to have lost faith in the Croatian Football Federation and have accused it of widespread corruption. The federation’s vice-president, Zdravko Mamic, has been charged with embezzling money from Dinamo Zagreb when he was chief executive there. Damir Vrbanovic, the federation’s executive director, has also been charged as an accomplice in the same case.', 'Last year, they were taken into custody (Mamic twice, as the investigation extended) amid fears that someone was trying to influence witnesses. Finally, Mamic was suspended from working at Dinamo by the authorities but both men kept their job at the federation and were both in the VIP lounge at the game against the Czechs.', 'Many fans in Croatia feel the national team has been hijacked by the pair – as well as Davor Suker, the CFF president who is seen by many as their puppet – and turned it into a tool for making money. Mamic and Vrbanovic deny this but there has been a long – and at the moment unsuccessful – campaign to have them removed via the legal system.', 'Croatia fans fight among themselves following the disruption to Friday’s match.', 'Some radical fans are so captivated by the hatred towards the CFF that they do not even mind if they are hurting the team with their actions. In fact, it goes further than that. They are now actively trying to sabotage the team, as they feel that international shame and on-pitch failure is the only chance for changes to finally take place in Croatian football.', 'Their aim may be to introduce more democracy and transparency in domestic football, a chance to start afresh, but their methods are all wrong. Other fans, who still support the team, started a scuffle with them in the stands after the flares were thrown. It is a sad indictment of the whole society that it has come to this.', 'Among the players and coaching staff on Friday night the sense was one of utter disillusionment. Croatia have four points after two games but no one was talking about the 2-2 draw against the Czech Republic . ""Maybe it would be best if we don’t play at all,"" said Ivan Perisic, who scored the opening goal for Croatia. ""Maybe that would actually be better in case these things are going to happen every time we play.""', 'The coach, Ante Cacic, added: ""We are all to blame. Let’s not start washing our hands from it.""', 'He is right, nothing will be won by people in authority not taking control of this ugly situation.

The trip was full of surprises: lizards in our suitcase, a couple days on islands with no Wi-Fi (and no English), and days spent doing yoga on the beach to round it all out. But what was perhaps the most baffling part of the whole thing was the one question I was asked again and again from fellow moms: ""Who is watching your kids?""', ""If I were a single mother, the question might be valid. But as a married mom whose husband has an equal hand in raising our brood to adulthood, it's quite astonishing to be asked that question again and again. No, I didn't hire a babysitter (at least not for the nights or weekends). No, I didn't leave them with the grandparents. My husband was with them."", 'Why would anyone find this shocking?', ""OK, so it's true. The list of daily tasks for the care and upkeep of three children is seemingly endless — from the moment they leap out of bed between 7 and 7:15 to the moment they hit the pillows around 8 or 8:30. The 2-year-old must be changed, washed, brushed, soothed, fed, held, rocked, amused, and watched multiple times a day. My 9-year-old and 7-year-old have homework to supervise, friend dramas to negotiate, permission slips to sign, and activities to attend. They dress and bathe themselves, but someone must be vigilant at all times to keep them on track."", 'Most Popular', ""Truth be told, I work part-time, so the bulk of the child duties does fall to me. But my husband knows the score. He is responsible for preschool drop-off every morning. He picks up from gymnastics every Wednesday, and takes charge of math homework and making sure our son reads for exactly 20 minutes every night. He changes diapers and also has access to the giant family calendar that hangs in our mudroom to track everyone's doctors appointments, playdates, birthday parties, and after-school activities. I might be behind the wheel mostly, but he's always next to me in the front seat reading the map."", 'So why the question?', 'Our society is full of all kinds of families, but our leafy suburb just outside of New York City often feels like there is one kind: traditional two-parent homes where one parent (usually the dad) works full-time while the long-suffering mother does everything with her kids. When I went on a business trip for a week two years ago, a friend confided in me: ""My husband wouldn\'t even be able to pack a lunch if I left.""', 'Why are we accepting this as normal?', ""My husband regularly goes to California for work. Last year, there were long periods where he left every Tuesday and returned on Friday afternoon. Not once, in all those weeks of lonely nights and busy mornings, did anyone ask him who was watching the kids. It's obvious, right? Daddies get to go out in the world. Mommies stay home. Mommy has it all under control. And I do. Mostly. But it's not easy when one spouse travels. A job that really belongs to two people suddenly falls to one. It's a fact my husband understands well."", 'This is why I needed a vacation. Alone.', '""How long are you gone again?"" he texted me on Wednesday, six days into my 11-day trip.', ""I had to laugh. But that is all I did. Because I knew that back home, even though he felt like he was drowning, he would doggy paddle his way back to shore somehow. My toddler's cot sheet might not get washed for preschool. And my son might get a B on a spelling test instead of his usual A, because my husband doesn't ride him as hard as I would've if I was home. But my children would be clean, well-fed, and (mostly) smiling when I got back. And they were."", ""My husband is not a babysitter. He is a parent just like me. Being alone with the kids is a challenge even for the most organized and dedicated among us. But that doesn't make Daddy less capable of it."", 'Upon my return, a friend said she could ""never do what you did."" Her husband wouldn\'t be able to keep it together. Not without massive amounts of help. And that\'s exactly the reason to go. Kids need to know their daddies can care for them as well.

8eca9c18-0696-4c5a-a465-d805539202f0,796215710095646720,new: how trump won florida,Twitter,"[""With more than 95 percent of precincts reporting, Donald Trump carried a 140,000 vote lead in Florida. | Getty How Trump won Florida Trump's Florida win was a microcosm of what unfolded nationwide."", 'Donald Trump’s stunning win in Florida was a microcosm of what unfolded nationwide on Tuesday: Despite losing big to Hillary Clinton in diverse, urban areas of south Florida, Trump dominated in every other corner of the state and outperformed past Republican candidates with older, white and blue collar voters.', 'With nearly all precincts reporting,Trump carried a nearly insurmountable 134,000 vote lead – 1.4 percentage points -- leaving Democrats crushed and Trump’s team elated with a win that, at one point, they felt wouldn’t come.', 'Story Continued Below', '""I am so proud of this team! MAGA!,"" Susie Wiles, Trump’s Florida campaign manager, said in a text message using the acronym for his ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Her tone was a 180-degree turn from early in the evening when she called the day ""tense and nerve wracking.""', 'Despite Hillary Clinton’s large margins in Miami-Dade County and Broward County, Trump ran up the score elsewhere in the state -- from the Deep South Panhandle to the interior of Florida to peninsula’s southwest, a bastion of working-class whites and retirees from the Midwest who pushed him over the top. Trump ran up huge margins with white Florida voters -- who comprise 64 percent of the state’s voting rolls -- and have always been the most reliable voters in terms of turnout. Latino turnout in Miami-Dade and Orange County was just not enough for Clinton.', 'The ups and downs of the campaign had gnawed at Wiles for weeks when she took over following a campaign shake-up that left her in charge of winning must-win Florida without much of a budget to advertise or turn out Republican voters who tend to disproportionately cast absentee ballots by mail.', 'In early October, as Hurricane Matthew left part of the state damaged, Wiles realized the campaign had mistakenly not run an absentee ballot program at all. She sounded the alarm and Trump made sure the money was reprogrammed.', 'Two weeks ago during a meeting at Trump’s golf club in Doral, sources said, Wiles successfully made the case to Trump to spend more on mail, advertising and paid callers to reach out to more Republican absentee ballot voters. Wiles, who managed Gov. Rick Scott’s first campaign, in 2010, would neither confirm nor deny the accounts.', 'The spending was noteworthy because Trump, notoriously tight-fisted with campaign money, believed that campaigns dropped too much money on TV and get-out-the-vote ""ground game"" efforts. Instead, Trump had his outsized personality, his knowledge of Florida – his second home where he owns the Palm Beach Mar-a-Lago estate – and his plane that could carry him to any spot on a moment’s notice in Florida, where thousands of supporters materialized for his rallies seemingly spontaneously.', 'But even with all of the new Trump spending, Hillary Clinton’s campaign began to surge. Black and Hispanic voters cast record numbers of absentee ballots and flocked to the early voting polls.', 'By Tuesday morning, Democrats felt confident they could ride out the wave of what they knew would be a surge of Republican voters who tend to vote in greater force on Election Day.', 'About 1 p.m., one source with Clinton’s campaign said, the Democrats were worried. Republicans were crushing the vote in the Panhandle, Southwest Florida and smaller conservative-leaning counties.', '""By 5 p.m., our voters showed again,"" the source, not authorized to speak by the campaign, said. ""We felt pretty good.""', 'The size of the vote was historic in populous Democratic strongholds like Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties.', 'But turnout was even higher in Republican areas. By the end of the night, Trump’s lead was so big that, even if turnout in Florida was modeled at 80 percent – far higher than recent elections – Clinton would still not win if she beat Trump by double digits.', 'Clinton’s campaign was almost reduced to a regional effort confined to the southeastern peninsula. She won a stunning 571,000 more votes than Trump in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale media market, one of ten in the state, according to state elections data posted after midnight. She won three lesser markets: West Palm (a 44,000-vote lead); Gainesville (10,000 more votes) and Tallahassee (11,000 more votes).', 'Trump blew away records in the Tampa Bay media market, the western edge of the vaunted I-4 corridor that helps swing elections. In the counties composing the market, Trump rolled up a 193,000 vote lead over Clinton. In the Jacksonville market in the northeast, he pulled in 165,000 more votes. He held vote leads of 144,000 in Naples-Fort Myers market, 126,000 in the Pensacola market, 83,000 in the Panama City market and 58,000 in the Orlando market, which anchors the eastern end of the I-4 corridor.', 'One of Trump’s pollsters, Tony Fabrizio, said the results showed that Clinton exceeded President Obama’s margins in the Florida markets he won in 2012. But Obama only carried Florida by less than a point.', '""The difference here is that Trump did far better than Mitt Romney did in almost every county on Election Day,"" Fabrizio said.', 'Trump began Election Day down by at least 57,000 votes to Clinton, according to results posted on the Florida Division of Elections website just after the last Florida polls closed at 7 p.m. Central Time. But after that, as Election Day votes poured in, Trump began building a margin that stretched to more than 100,000 by 8:30 p.m.', 'By 9:10 p.m., Trump’s margin started to peak at just under 150,000 votes over Clinton. It started to trend down. But not fast enough for the liking of Democrats, who just two hours before were musing about how Trump had lost Florida and therefore the White House.', '""So goes Florida, so goes the country,"" said Florida’s senior senator, Bill Nelson. ""Look at the Hispanics turning out. Often the Hispanics are registered no party affiliation, but the young Hispanics, they’ll be voting for Hillary.""', 'Nelson and other Democrats also expected Clinton to pad her margin with African-American support.', 'But while Clinton rolled up votes with non-white voters, white voters appeared to heavily trend toward Trump. And whites are still a majority of Florida’s voter rolls, 64 percent by registration. And they vote in even greater numbers. Their outsized support counteracted the votes of Hispanics and blacks – 16 percent and 13 percent of the voter rolls, respectively.', 'Trump’s strong showing calls into question those who believed his inflammatory comments about immigration reform would ultimately cost him Florida. Trump’s positions put him at loggerheads with the Spanish-language powerhouse network, Univision, which has studios in the same city as his Doral golf club.', '""My theory is that no one can make it to the WH without the Latino vote. It seems @realDonaldTrump has a different theory. See you Nov 8th,"" Univision pundit Jorge Ramos wrote June 3 on Twitter, repeating his oft-held maxim – proven wrong in this instance by Trump – about the power of the Hispanic vote.', 'Florida is also a retiree mecca, with one of the oldest populations in the country. And poll after poll showed that the older the voter, the more they liked Trump.', 'Most major surveys also showed Trump losing the state – including exit polls on Election Day.', '""This was a data defying feat that captured a populist fervor we just couldn’t measure,"" said one Republican pollster who was surprised by Trump’s numbers. ""The Trump campaign kept talking about the missing white voter. Well, they showed up on Election Day.""', 'In myriad ways, Trump succeeded despite the conventional wisdom.', 'Trump’s campaign initially didn’t run a robust absentee-ballot program to get voters to fill out and mail back their votes. He delayed advertising on television – a must for any other statewide candidate. And he refused at times to soften his tone on immigration.', '""Trump didn’t run a robust program in South Florida targeting the Hispanic community. You could make an argument that his past statements [about immigration and illegal immigrants] made it impossible,"" said Curt Anderson, top adviser to Gov. Scott, the chair of the pro-Trump super PAC. ""But when Gov. Scott won, he did so because he really reached out. If Trump had, we wouldn’t be talking right now. He would have Florida in the bag. Maybe he’ll win because of what’s in the countryside, so to speak, or the Panhandle. But this is really doing it the hard way.""', 'The Florida meltdown is a familiar story for Democrats still scarred by Al Gore’s 2000 loss to George W. Bush in a razor close race. Though Obama won the state twice, both times were by narrow margins built on the strength of his appeal to minority voters in the state.', 'But the vaunted Obama machine in Florida was no machine without Obama on the ticket. Now Democrats face a bleak prospect of the coming midterm elections, when liberal-leaning voters tend to stay away from the polls while Republicans keep voting. Sen. Nelson’s team fears a showdown with Scott, who has won twice based on the strength of white voters and an outsider message.', 'Clinton allies expressed increasing optimism about their chances in the state heading into Election Day, energized by early vote results that showed Hispanic turnout exploding. Exit polls reinforced that optimism, showing Clinton with a narrow lead and demographic trends pointing her way.', 'Trump’s strength was no surprise to Republican Party of Florida Chairman Blaise Ingoglia, who earlier in the day said Republicans had more energized voters who couldn’t wait until Election Day to cast ballots.', '""We had the advantage in high-propensity voters and they didn’t,"" Ingoglia said.

It’s an anti-establishment year.""']",How Trump won Florida,Trump's Florida win was a microcosm of what unfolded nationwide.,,"['http://static2.politico.com/dims4/default/343483b/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc2%2F56%2F34510eb845e1a9a61cde5be4c131%2F11-donald-trump-8-gty-1160.jpg', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==', 'http://static.politico.com/c2/56/34510eb845e1a9a61cde5be4c131/11-donald-trump-8-gty-1160.jpg']",http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/florida-results-not-in-2016-231004,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'By getting more votes', 'spoilerPublisher': 'HuffPoSpoilers'}",['Trump ran up huge margins with white Florida voters -- who comprise 64 percent of the state’s voting rolls -- and have always been the most reliable voters in terms of turnout.'],"[[[5, 306], [5, 482]]]",['passage']

The program, to be carried out in nearby Oakland, is meant to test a scheme called Universal Basic Income, or UBI. While it’s far from mainstream acceptance, UBI is viewed by some as a means to provide workers with economic stability as an increasing amount of the world’s labor is automated.', '""I think we are moving towards a world with less job security,"" says Matthew Krisiloff, who is managing Y Combinator’s UBI study. ""There’s political consensus around it, and there’s relative simplicity in the sense that it’s just direct cash and you can spend it however you want.""', 'Here’s what you should know about UBI:', 'What is Universal Basic Income?', 'In its most pure form, a government would send all citizens a certain annual income to everyone, regardless of their salary, age or employment status, typically in installments throughout the year.', 'In reality, it gets a little more complicated. Sending money to every single citizen is expensive, so most UBI proposals involve some limits on who is eligible for the money — minors and the already-wealthy, for instance, might get smaller checks. Limits aside, the general point remains the same: (Almost) everyone gets a check from the government to spend without restrictions.', 'Why is it popular?', 'The basic concept has intellectual roots dating back to at least the 18th century . Some on the political left have supported UBI a tool to redistribute wealth to the poor and provide a means to improve people’s quality of life, while some on the right have seen it as a way to make the existing welfare state more efficient while promoting individual choice and reducing ""welfare traps.""', 'Despite sporadic support on both sides of the aisle, UBI has historically remained on the policy fringes. Many worry that a basic income could reduce the incentive to work, slowing the economy. Another concern is whether providing a basic income is the best way to spend public funds that could be specifically targeted to certain groups in need, the model most welfare programs currently follow.', 'However, a confluence of factors have started to push basic income into the mainstream. Rising inequality and persistently slow economic growth have spawned concerns about the ability for working people to get ahead without increased assistance, for instance. Meanwhile, advances in automation and artificial intelligence have raised the prospect of a future with significantly fewer jobs for human workers. A recent However, a confluence of factors have started to push basic income into the mainstream. Rising inequality and persistently slow economic growth have spawned concerns about the ability for working people to get ahead without increased assistance, for instance. Meanwhile, advances in automation and artificial intelligence have raised the prospect of a future with significantly fewer jobs for human workers. A recent Oxford University study found that as many as 47% percent of jobs are at risk of being computerized (although another study found that number may be as low as 9%).', 'Is anyone getting paid yet?', 'No nation has implemented a universal basic income, but the idea has gained traction in a few countries. Sweden recently voted down an initiative that would have implemented a relatively generous basic income for adults on top of the country’s existing social services, Britain’s labor party is considering advocating for a basic income, Finland may implement a version of UBI next year, and a city in the Netherlands is also pursuing a basic income experiment .', 'Y Combinator’s Krisiloff says the newfound discussion of a basic income represents a fresh attitude towards government welfare programs. ""I think part of the reason it’s back in vogue is because people are more accepting of unconditional programs,"" he says. ""People are starting to think there are more cost effective, less paternalistic, hands-on ways to help.""']",Why this tech company is giving 100 people free money,"Startup accelerator Y Combinator is

This story, originally published on his 70th birthday on January 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).', 'Stephen Hawking turns 70 on Sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century.', 'The famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience. For much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). And since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system—which he operates with his cheek—and have around-the-clock care.', ""But his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down. Hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge. And he is currently the director of research at the school's Center for Theoretical Cosmology."", ""But like his mind, Hawking's illness seems to be singular. Most patients with ALS—also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease—are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis. Hawking's condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday."", 'Why has Hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis? We spoke with Leo McCluskey, an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the ALS Center at the University of Pennsylvania, to find out more about the disease and why it has spared Hawking and his amazing brain.', 'What is ALS—and is there more than one form of it?', ""ALS, which is also known as a motor-neuron disease—and colloquially as Lou Gehrig's disease in the U.S.—is a neurodegenerative disease. Each muscle is controlled by motor neurons that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe. These are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neurons that reside lower down in the brain—as well as motor neurons that reside in the spinal cord. The guys in the brain are called the upper motor neurons, and the guys in the spine are called the lower motor neurons. The disease causes weakness of either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons or both."", ""It's been known for quite some time that there are variants of ALS. One is referred to as progressive muscular atrophy, or PMA. It appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons. However, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons."", 'There is also primary lateral sclerosis—PLS—and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder. However, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder.', 'The other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy—or progressive supranuclear palsy—which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles. But it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles.', ""Those are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described. And it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons. It's now clear that that's not true. It's now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that don't contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe. So some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia."", ""One of the misconceptions about ALS is that it's only a motor-neuron disease, and that's not true."", ""What has Stephen Hawking's case shown about the disease?"", ""One thing that is highlighted by this man's course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways. On average people live two to three years after diagnosis. But that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time."", ""Life expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm—the breathing muscles. So the common way people die is of respiratory failure. And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. If you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time—even though you're getting worse. What's happened to him is just astounding. He's certainly an outlier."", 'Has he lived so long because he got the disease when he was young and had the juvenile-onset type?', ""Juvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and I don't know enough about his course to say. But it's probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly. I have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s. But not having ever examined him or taken a history, it's a little hard for me to say."", ""He's a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur."", 'How frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS?', 'I would say probably less than a few percent.', ""How much do you think Stephen Hawking's longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of ALS?"", ""It's probably a little bit of both. I just know him from television, so I don't know what kind of interventions he's had. If he really isn't on a ventilator, then it's his biology—it's the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live. For trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table. But mostly it's about the biology of the disease."", ""Hawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition. Is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients' outcomes? Or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference?"", ""I don't believe that adds to longevity."", ""ALS still doesn't have a cure. What have we learned about the disease recently that might help us find one—or at least better treatments?"", ""Beginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, ALS was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain. Ten percent of ALS is genetic and based on a gene mutation. I'm sure there are also at-risk genes for ALS, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease. Each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain. Knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies. But none of this has given us any robust therapies yet."", ""What does Stephen Hawking's case mean for people who have the disease?"", ""It's just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease—and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life. Unfortunately, it's a small percentage of people for whom that actually happens.""]",How Has Stephen Hawking Lived Past 70 with ALS?,50% of people diagnosed with ALS will live about 4 years.

ec1827d5-7798-437e-bea1-0fd8f5c7eb7c,741631679169724416,here's why summer in new york city smells so awful,Twitter,"['For travelers with the gleam of the Big Apple in their eye, nothing seems better than New York City in the summertime.', ""Restaurants have outdoor seating, there are festivals all over town, and you don't have to worry about bringing your jacket to Top of the Rock."", 'But long-time city dwellers know the horror behind the mystique: those awful smells that dominate every daily commute to and from the office.', ""Here's why it's hard to escape the stench of the city in the heat of summer."", 'New York City has the highest population density in the US, and with 8,550,405 people roaming the nation’s melting pot, it’s bound to get smelly.', 'A census conducted in July 2015 showed that the city had a population density of over 27,000 people per square mile. To put that into perspective, the US, on average, holds only 80 people per square mile. That much combined body odor alone could be enough to scare anyone away.', 'With such an insanely huge number of people living in just one city, it should come as no surprise that there is also an insanely huge amount of garbage produced.', 'Although residents of the city produce 12,000 tons of waste every day, New York City doesn’t have any of its own landfills or incinerators. Garbage piles up in dumpsters until it can all be taken across the Hudson River to be incinerated in New Jersey, or, if possible, recycled locally and overseas.', 'But even after most of this waste has been incinerated across the river, strong winds can still carry the stench back over to the city on a hot day.', ""The sheer amount of garbage isn’t the only problem. There also has to be a way to get all of it out of the city. Diesel trucks carry garbage out of Manhattan 7.8 million times each year. Let this sink in: That’s the same as driving around the earth 312 times, and that's just for one city."", 'All this driving only adds to pollution and the greenhouse effect, causing the city to become warmer and smellier as time continues.', 'You may also be wondering why those subway vents on every block smell so much more putrid on a steamy summer day.

Chances are, there would be nothing inside one of those that would make your day any better. But James Butler might disagree with you there.', 'James was strolling through Coonskin Park, a riverside sliver of nature located in Kanawha County, West Virginia, when he heard a strange noise coming from one of the dumpsters there. Curiosity piqued, he investigated, only to discover something that had him fumbling for his camera...', 'Retired West Virginia police officer and aviation enthusiast James Butler heard strange cries coming from a Charleston, West Virginia, dumpster on Tuesday, August 11, 2015. Curious, he investigated the sounds.', ""Right away, he noticed two things. Five raccoons were trapped inside the Coonskin Park trash receptacle, and one of those raccoons was like nothing he'd ever seen before."", 'As to how they got stuck, James said, ""The dumpster had apparently been emptied and the garbage level was low and the raccoons couldn’t reach the top to get back out."" And that rare raccoon?', ""He didn't really look like like his family members—or like any raccoon James had ever seen! This trashmonger was an albino raccoon, an incredibly rare specimen according to the Indiana Division of Fish and Wildlife. How rare, exactly?"", ""The organization stated only one in 750,000 raccoons inherit the albino gene, a mutation that means the animal creates no melanin and therefore has no pigmentation. Stunned by his find, James didn't forget the real trouble at hand—these raccoons were stuck."", 'Thinking quickly, James fabricated a little something to help the raccoons escape their trash pit prison: a wood plank. He leaned it on the inside of the dumpster, and the raccoons could use it like a ramp! They were free—but that brought consequences.', 'The albino raccoon had been ""a well-kept secret"" in Coonskin Park, according to Rodney Jones, chief of Kanawha\'s Park Police Department.

""She spent the last couple days glued to my side, sleeping on my lap, having me carry her around...I just saw a complete 180-degree flip in her personality the minute she was exposed to some kindness.""', ""For a raccoon once deemed so aggressive she had to be kept away from other raccoons at the facility, that's a pretty glowing review! But the story of Isis only underscored the worry of Rodney Jones, the chief of Kanawha’s Park Police Department..."", ""People like James Butler are often fascinated with animals that are different and unique, but it's important to remember they're wild animals—potentially dangerous and capable of love and affection. They're to be admired from afar!"", 'James had the right idea when he saw the albino raccoon: he took some photos, set him free from the dumpster, and let him go on his way.

A daunting task even as the kids get older and the lists get shorter. Gone in my house are the days when the most expensive item on the list was the ever-elusive ""just this size"" binder. Now, we’re talking calculators that rival my electricity bill. But I sigh, watch the ads, and get out there and do it.', 'I put on my thickest armor because nothing will be just right for my kids. The kitty folders are too childish; the more mature ones are $200 a piece. Add to that the hysterical mobs crowding the $1 pencils like they were the last chance to win tickets to a 21 Pilots concert, and we have a joyfest that keeps on giving. (Insert sarcastic eye roll here).', 'Yes, I’m frustrated.', 'And let’s talk about that list, shall we? I mean, who in their right mind thinks it’s a good idea to request that our kids purchase Expo markers in bulk or boxes of Kleenex that should be supplied already? ESPECIALLY when those might not get used by my kids? Who thinks it should be my job to bring Ziploc bags to school?', 'Well, I’ll tell you who.', 'This mom.', 'I’m not going to buy just the one extra box of tissues because (let’s all be honest here) I can afford more than that. And *gasp* what if someone other than my precious Timmy uses them? Well, then, haven’t I done a good deed for the year for less than the cost of a coffee?', 'We should all be interested in what will create the best learning environment for all these kids, for all these little people who will be making big decisions some day like what to do with YOUR Social Security or how to fix YOUR city infrastructure or how best to treat that cancerous mass in YOUR body.', 'If you don’t agree with something on the list and think it’s excessive, have a conversation with the teacher. I guarantee if it is something that will actually get used to educate your children, the teacher will be able to explain how.', 'Yes, Expo markers are expensive. Get in a classroom and watch children solve problems at their desks (sometimes ON them) with them and really engage in the process because it all of a sudden became colorful and perhaps a little bit taboo.', 'You think you have to buy too many glue sticks? I invite you to join a class when they do a simple sorting and gluing project that gives the kids one more opportunity to understand all the ""-augh"" words and their various pronunciations and watch multiple children go through half a stick just for that one project.', 'More is more, right? And yes, the theory is that you teach them to use less, but let’s be honest: some just use what they use. Watch kids ""clean"" the floor at the end of the day and, in a rush to get home, throw away all the ""trash"" they found, which includes half used pencils and crayons that would take too long to find a home for.', 'So, let’s fast forward to January. The supplies are no longer new and shiny, and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise. Used and broken crayons look better in that circular file than in pencil boxes. Glue sticks that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren’t worth it anymore. Markers find new homes in backpacks. Pencils that have no erasers have lost their appeal. Dry erase markers are dried up because they have been used to solve, spell, create. And then what happens?', 'Supplies that were an extra $10 from you at the beginning of the year for one kid become extras in your kid’s teacher’s cart at Target during a grocery run. And forget the $10. Oh no. Multiply that sucker by – how many kids were in that classroom? Was it 20? 30? Let’s see.', 'Does your job ask you to shell out a couple hundred bucks to upgrade your software or buy staples? And if it’s teaching your kid how to multiply better or be able to compose a sentence without referring to spell check, isn’t that extra $10 a little worth it?', 'I’m frustrated by our entitlement. We act like we’re doing the schools and the teachers a favor when we fill that backpack with tissues and markers.', 'Umm, let’s back up a minute. Aren’t they the ones doing us the favor?', 'I mean, are we willing to take a step (or 200) backward and fill in gaps caused by something as silly as a distracted kid (who then distracts others) because he can’t find a glue stick to finish his project? And yes, we went through school without some of these things, but these kids are more accustomed to bright and shiny. Maybe sad, but still true. And if bright and shiny go away, attention spans shorten, and kids are more disruptive. And guess what? Kids don’t learn as well then.', 'I’m frustrated that we can’t see just how big a job these incredibly underpaid teachers are undertaking. So, my suggestion is to watch for sales and stock up. Buy the extra box of tissues. Do the right thing and thank that teacher for all the efforts to make our future decision-makers great ones.

""If like us, you have a small team, limited resources and a tight budget that simply cannot stretch to huge marketing campaigns, you need to think outside the box. For us, this meant putting a lot of emphasis on our community in hopes of the power of the ‘word of mouth’. This strategy has paid off and we do believe it is a valid route for other indies.

(To support his claim, he points, in part, to the show's lack of an audience in Russia.)"", ""To some degree, this is true. Back when the series debuted, the media wrote about Mad Men to a level far exceeding its actual ratings. The first season's viewership numbers dipped below the 1 million mark a few times — a much more perilous event in an age when DVRs and streaming services were less prevalent. But by season two, the awards and critical attention Mad Men garnered ended up boosting those numbers to more comfortable levels, and even if the show was never a smash hit, it had a long, healthy run."", ""Still, there are a bunch of good, mostly reductive reasons for the media to keep, in Idov's words, shoving Mad Men down readers' throats. Here are five."", '1) Readers wanted to read about it', 'In my pre-Vox life, I was the TV editor of The A.V. Club, a position that gave me unique insight into what sorts of TV content readers wanted to consume. And every time we wrote about Mad Men, those numbers spiked. The show was consistently among the top five series we wrote about in terms of readership, and a well-timed thinkpiece always had the potential to blow up.', 'The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle', ""This has carried right over to Vox. We write a lot about the show because there's a huge audience out there ready to devour Mad Men content — far beyond any other show I've written about here that's not Game of Thrones. The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle."", ""Yes, the huge explosion of commentary in the days preceding the show's finale was driven by how much many of us in the media liked the show. But it was also driven by the fact that our readers wanted to see this sort of material. Some of that was an accident of timing."", '2) Mad Men debuted right after The Sopranos ended and filled the void the show left', 'When Mad Men began, in the summer of 2007, The Sopranos had ended just a few weeks before. The Wire (never as popular in terms of raw readership numbers, though no slouch itself) would end in early 2008. Lost was the king of the recap roost at the time, but those who wrote about it usually focused more on grand, unified theories of why the show worked, rather than the sorts of symbolic interpretations The Sopranos invited.', 'Mad Men also benefitted from the rise of TV recapping in general', 'Thus, there was a huge opening in the ""reading about TV on the internet"" marketplace that was beginning to boom in the late 2000s, and Mad Men filled it as surely as it filled the slots vacated by Sopranos at the Golden Globes and the Emmys. The two shows\' thematic concerns, use of dreamlike imagery, and storytelling structure were incredibly similar, which only helped matters.', ""But Mad Men also benefited from the rise of TV recapping in general. Alan Sepinwall began his seminal blog What's Alan Watching in late 2005, and by that final Sopranos season, dozens of publications were dipping their toes into the recap waters. That number would explode in years to come — and Mad Men was a natural fit for publications that wanted to write TV recaps and people who wanted to read them."", ""3) There just wasn't as much good TV on"", ""When Mad Men started, it was popular to suggest that the end of The Sopranos, the cancellation of HBO's Deadwood, and the impending end of The Wire signaled the end of TV's Golden Age. (Sound familiar?) Instead, Mad Men and later Breaking Bad picked up that ball and ran with it, while FX entered the early stages of a hot streak that continues to this day."", 'But, really, in that summer of 2007, the established shows worth writing about were few and far between — especially if you didn\'t want to publish weekly, in-depth reviews of comedies (a later development, largely driven by content-hungry sites like, well, The A.V. Club). They were essentially limited to The Wire, Dexter, Lost, Heroes, 24, Grey\'s Anatomy, and maybe Veronica Mars (if your readership was especially young). Thus, it was easy to get the ""serious TV"" audience to tune in to Mad Men, because there weren\'t a ton of other options.', 'Mad Men suggested every cable channel should have its own scripted drama series in development — and now they pretty much all do', ""Contrast that to today, when a show like The Americans can't get the same sort of readership traction as Mad Men (even though it has a loyal, dedicated audience that likes reading about it), simply because there's so much more stuff out there. This most recent season of that FX drama received the kind of acclaim Mad Men did in its heyday — but it's much, much harder for a series to cut through the noise from all those other shows out there. Mad Men suggested every single cable channel should have its own scripted drama in development — and now they pretty much all do."", '4) Mad Men was actually pretty popular, when all was said and done', ""Though it never pulled in Big Bang Theory numbers, AMC told Vulture's Joe Adalian that at the show's height, a total of just under 7 million people watched it. That number's not insignificant, and even a tiny percentage of that audience consistently reading pieces about the show online would be more than enough to drive significant traffic to most websites — especially back in 2007, when the overall online readership was smaller."", '5) Never underestimate passion', ""As my colleague Matthew Yglesias wrote about the popularity of Bernie Sanders' presidential candidacy online, a small but rabidly passionate audience for a particular topic can be lifeblood to a website that craves readers. What holds true for Sanders is also true for Mad Men: there are very few casual Mad Men fans. And those passionate fans tend to seek out everything they can find about the show."", 'Early on, the media positioned Mad Men as a sort of lifestyle choice', 'The media is, of course, at least somewhat complicit in this. Early on, we positioned the series as a sort of lifestyle choice — if you were cool, you would watch Mad Men. But TV sites have said that about a lot of shows over the years, and few of them held up, readership-wise, as well as Mad Men did. (Whither Boardwalk Empire?) Yes, the early push might have been a bit much, but Mad Men ended up having the goods — at least for the people who cared about it.', 'I agree with the theoretical concerns behind the criticisms of media coverage of Mad Men. Those of us who write about television do too often ignore the shows that a majority of Americans are actually watching, shows like The Big Bang Theory and NCIS and even Empire.', ""But the kinds of people who read our websites are also far more likely to want to take a deep dive into the latest episode of Mad Men than they are to want to read a careful analysis of even several episodes of NCIS. (Believe me. I've tried.) The answer to why the media keeps pushing Mad Men on the people is simple: the people keep pushing it on us.""]",The real reason people write so much about Mad Men: you keep clicking,The show hit at just the right time to ride the growing TV recap boom.,,"['https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53520017/625496290.0.jpg', 'https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRSlOihPEVuoFYY3bczwYfHTHE0=/576x0:3600x2016/1200x800/filters:focal(576x0:3600x2016)/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/46358696/e91a27d7-7779-a797-8ea8-6ba397e972e7_MM_714_JM_0623_1545.0.0.jpg', 'https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53529619/_94928968_originalpic.0.jpg', 'https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53527277/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_6.39.44_PM.1488585270.png', 'https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53484121/medicine1.0.jpg', 'https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jcIKfVCivl71No-eC-i8ZS8TfBU=/0x9:3600x2009/1080x600/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/46358696/e91a27d7-7779-a797-8ea8-6ba397e972e7_MM_714_JM_0623_1545.0.0.jpg', 'https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53525779/zeldabreath.0.jpg', 'https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53521487/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_2.18.56_PM.0.png', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs', 'https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53535527/GettyImages_647615482.0.jpg', 'https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53519805/shutterstock_554313283.0.jpg', 'https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53532165/arnold.0.png', 'https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53527277/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_6.39.44_PM.1488585270.png']",http://vox.com/e/8389932?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Because you keep clicking.', 'spoilerPublisher': 'SavedYouAClick'}","['1) Readers wanted to read about it', '2) Mad Men debuted right after The Sopranos ended and filled the void the show left', ""3) There just wasn't as much good TV on"", '4) Mad Men was actually pretty popular, when all was said and done', '5) Never underestimate passion']","[[[4, 0], [4, 34]], [[9, 0], [9, 83]], [[14, 0], [14, 39]], [[19, 0], [19, 66]], [[21, 0], [21, 30]]]",['multi']

Cohn noted that the GOP nominee is viewed as fundamentally unfit for the job by an unusually large percentage of Republican voters, perhaps creating unique complications in the quest to unify them.', '""Many Republican voters have an unfavorable impression of him — worse still, many don’t even think he has the knowledge, temperament or qualifications to be president,"" Cohn wrote. ""If Mr. Trump can’t reunify Republican-leaning voters, Mrs. Clinton really could win in a landslide.""', 'Speaking in Warren, Mich., on Aug. 11, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton outlined her vision for the U.S. economy. (The Washington Post)', 'Today brings new polling that suggests these conditions may indeed may taking shape.', 'The new NBC News/Survey Monkey Tracking Poll finds Clinton leading Trump among registered voters nationally by 50-41. Even more crucially, Clinton is demolishing Trump on the question of who has the right personality and temperament to be president: 42 percent of voters say Clinton does, versus only 17 percent who say Trump does.', 'But note Trump’s numbers among Republicans on the temperament question:', 'Fewer than one in five Republicans believe Trump has the right personality and temperament to serve as president. (By contrast, 39 percent of Democrats say that about Clinton.) Now, this is only one poll, and the temperament numbers for both candidates were perhaps driven downward by the question wording, which did not poll each individual trait in a separate question, instead asking respondents to pick all the traits that apply.', 'But this general finding shows up in other polls, too. A recent Washington Post/ABC News survey found that a surprisingly high 23 percent of Republicans agreed that Trump is ""not qualified to serve as president,"" while 74 percent said he is qualified. Among all adults, 61 percent said Trump is not qualified. Meanwhile, the Post/ABC poll also found that a staggering 34 percent of Republicans say Trump does not have the right kind of personality and temperament to serve effectively as president, while 67 percent of overall Americans said the same. For Clinton, the percentages of Democrats who said she was unfit for the job by both those metrics was in single digits, while large majorities of overall adults gave her the thumbs-up on them.', 'This basic imbalance is one of the under-appreciated narratives of this race. It regularly gets lost amid claims that both candidates are historically disliked. While this is true, the underlying and arguably more important story is that in spite of this, only one of the two candidates is widely seen as fundamentally prepared and qualified for the presidency, while the other is widely seen as unprepared and lacking in the basic qualities required for it. And this core imbalance goes deeper: Only one of them is seen as unfit by surprisingly large percentages of voters from his or her own party.', 'To be clear, Trump could obviously still win this race or make it very close, if he succeeds in uniting Republican voters in the home stretch. It seems very likely to tighten. External events or new Clinton revelations could still shake things up. But the conventions are over, and the Clinton team — operating with a candidate with very real weaknesses of her own — appears to be well on its way towards accomplishing its goal of making this election all about Trump’s increasingly obvious temperamental unfitness and lack of qualifications for the job.

That’s a combined $104 million in total ad spending for Team Clinton. But in that same time frame, Donald Trump’s campaign still hasn’t spent a single cent on a general-election ad, with two pro-Trump outside groups coming to the rescue with $12.4 million over the airwaves. That’s a nearly 9-to-1 advantage in ad spending.', 'It’s another fundamental Trumpian disadvantage that could grow more pronounced in the home stretch.', '* TRUMP WOULD PROBABLY SEND TROOPS TO MIDEAST: The New York Times makes a good point about Trump’s big foreign policy speech yesterday:', 'Though Mr. Trump made no reference to whether he would send more American troops back to the region, that appeared to be the clear implication. The kind of relentless attacks on the Islamic State he advocates — along with taking and holding the oil fields, which may well be a violation of international law — would require a considerable presence by American troops or their allies, and foreign bases to launch the drones.', 'Trump’s promise is basically to promise to crush the terrorist enemy while vowing no messy entanglements abroad. It’s a scam.', '* TRUMP’S POLICY GIBBERISH: Trump is now proposing to impose a new ideological test on those trying to enter the country from areas scarred by terrorism. CNN analyst Peter Bergen explains why the idea is half baked at best:', 'This seems unworkable. For example, would anyone sitting for these tests volunteer that they had secret proclivities for jihadist terrorism? Also, Trump didn’t specify what countries would be affected by this new test. But France has a serious domestic terrorism problem — would French citizens be subjected to this kind of test?...In short, Trump didn’t say who would be targeted for these ideological tests, saying only that he would consult the State Department about how to approach this issue.', 'The idea is really an effort to repackage Trump’s Muslim ban as somehow being in sync with American values.', '* TRUMP’S BIG LIE ABOUT ISIS: Trump continues to claim (as he did in his speech yesterday) that Obama policies were the chief cause of ISIS. Glenn Kessler corrects the record:', 'This is false and facile. The terror group is the direct result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003....At best, one could argue that actions that Obama failed to take (over Clinton’s opposition) helped contribute to the growth of ISIS.', 'What’s always missing from Trump’s account is that Clinton was more hawkish than Obama was. Meanwhile, Kessler’s interview with author Joby Warrick explores all this in more detail.', '* TRUMP MAY COST GOP A GENERATION OF VOTERS: Trump is getting slaughtered among younger voters. Michael Gerson reflects on the reasons for this and its potential consequences:', 'Younger voters are less likely than other age groups to regard racially inclusive language as ""politically correct."" They are less likely to believe in ""reverse discrimination"" and to embrace anti-immigrant attitudes....Young people understand the logo of the Republican nominee...as conveying a message of exclusion. These are the first serious political impressions of my younger son, voting in his first presidential election this year. It is the way to lose a generation.', 'Never Trump conservatives and Democrats both agree that the GOP’s nomination of Trump provides a unique opportunity to tarnish the GOP among a whole new generation.', '* CLINTON PREPARES FOR SLIME-FEST DEBATE: Politico’s Annie Karni reports that the Clinton team is preparing for the absolute worst at the debates with Trump:', 'The person picked to be Hillary Clinton’s sparring partner in her upcoming debate prep sessions is expected to confront her about the death of Vincent Foster, label her as a rapist’s enabler, and invoke the personally painful memories of Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers....one of the key components of that prep...is finding a person who can stand in as Donald Trump during mock debates and launch personal attacks...that will make the real Trump look tame by comparison.', 'Cue up a fresh round of commentary claiming that Trump’s ""street fighting"" debate style should make Democrats very, very afraid — even though thus far it has been a buffoonish failure.']",Is Clinton headed for a landslide win?

Now, the tournament seems headed on the other side of a border on which Trump declares he wants to build a wall.', 'The PGA needs a clean break from the sport’s less than glorious past track record for racial relations after an era when Afro-American-Asian legend Tiger Woods was by far the top draw for the sport. Golf’s professional bodies have worked long and hard to integrate their sport into America’s mainstream majority of tolerant society, the sport having started at member’s only golf clubs which used to exclude women, African-Americans, Latinos and Jews from many private courses.

Obama believes strongly in the institution of marriage — so strongly that he has at least three current wives, although press reports have put the number as high as 12.

When asked by The Post how many wives and children he has, Obama demurred.

""That’s personal,"" he said.

Obama made headlines in 2011 when he married his third wife, who was still in her teens.

Obama plans to trek back to the US to vote for Trump in November. Obama used to live in Maryland, where he worked for many years as an accountant and is registered to vote there, public records show.

With the adoption of modern lifestyles, men, too are becoming infertile these days.', 'A renowned gynecologist and infertility and in vitro fertilisation specialist, Dr. Sonia Malik, at one of the leading fertility treatment centres in New Delhi, stated that 46% of Indians, between the ages of 31 and 40 years, need medical intervention to conceive. This is because one or both partners in the relationship are suffering from fertility problems. Another city gynaecologist named, Dr. Yashica Gudesar, said one of the main reasons causing infertility is polycystic ovarian disorder in women and reduced sperm count in men.', 'Studies also suggest that it is wrong to blame the women all the time for being infertile. Statistically, in nearly 30% of all infertility cases, men have been found to be infertile, as per Society for the Study of Male Reproduction.', 'Some of the reasons that doctors have stated for this problem is irregular working hours and work stress in the IT, media industry and BPOs. Apparently, constant use of Android or iPhone affects sperm count as they have higher emission rate. Environmental pollution also to some extent contributes to low sperm count. The food you eat and your sleeping patterns have also found to affect the quality of sperms and eggs these days. Moreover, men who smoke cigarettes regularly are at an increased risk of infertility says, Dr. Ved Prakash.', 'But dear men, worry not! There is a solution to every problem. And while cutting down on your smokes and adopting a better lifestyle is one of them, it’s not the only one. IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection offers a good chance of pregnancy. Nowadays, people are becoming more open to consulting IVF centers for problems relating to infertility such as erectile dysfunction, or not being able to have a child.

But on Thursday, Hillary Clinton’s campaign announced it would begin spending precious advertising dollars in the state. The advertising buy is focused on Nebraska’s second congressional district, and includes two ads about Clinton’s advocacy for children.', 'It is an expensive bet on a state that has almost always voted red. But there’s a simple reason behind what seems like a gamble: Nebraska allocates its electoral college votes not in the usual winner-take-all method, but by congressional district. So a Republican candidate can win in the state, but a Democratic candidate can still pick up electoral votes by winning over a district.', 'The second congressional district, which is centered in Omaha and its suburbs, has a history of occasionally voting differently from the rest of deep-red Nebraska.', 'The district went for Mitt Romney in 2012 but for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. In 2014, when Democrats lost a wave of congressional races across the country, Democrat Brad Ashford won the district’s seat in U.S. Congress. And as a Clinton aide pointed out, the African-American share of the vote in the district is higher than the statewide average—and Clinton has shown she consistently over-performs among black voters.', 'The electoral college’s winner-take-all system means that reliably Democratic states like Massachusetts and Oregon—or reliably Republican states like Texas and Alabama—are never seriously contested by presidential candidates. They predictably vote Democratic or Republican. But in Nebraska and Maine—the two states that allocate their electoral votes by congressional district—there is more room for the parties to maneuver. They can spend ad dollars and campaign in states that they could never win outright.', 'It’s an electoral strategy that Donald Trump is hoping to take advantage of, too. This week he campaigned in Maine, which also allocates its electoral votes by congressional district but usually supports a Democrat. He held a rally in Bangor in the state’s second congressional district, which is predominantly white and rural.', 'Clinton has begun a broad and expensive advertising campaign in the swing states that you’d expect: Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Iowa, Nevda, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina. In those states, as well as in her Nebraska ad buy, Clinton has aired advertisements that tout her role in the creation of the Children’s Health Insurance Program in the 1990s.', 'These are the two ads that will be playing in Nebraska.']",Hillary Clinton Is Advertising in Deep-Red Nebraska.

Unlike so much of what comes from Trump on policy, this is a genuinely clarifying moment, with potentially enormous long-term implications.', 'The near-term political consequences of this will — or should — be that there is now no chance whatsoever that Bernie Sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a Trump victory more likely. I don’t believe Sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the Democratic primaries. Indeed, I believe it’s likely Sanders will see it this way, too.', 'To get all the details on Trump’s full energy plan, read Brad Plumer’s piece. Trump would pursue a mostly standard-issue GOP agenda of ""fewer regulations and more fossil fuel production."" More important, with some reporters wondering what Trump’s actual views are on global climate change, he clarified them: He is utterly indifferent to its existence and would roll back the main things we’re currently putting in place to deal with it.', 'Trump said that the current environmental challenges that the Obama administration is trying to tackle are ""phony."" He added that he would ""rescind"" the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, which would curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, and is key to the U.S.’s ability to meet its commitments as part of the global climate deal. He would withdraw the U.S. from participation in that global accord.', 'As I’ve reported before, there are complexities that could make it harder than expected for a Republican president — even one as masterfully competent and strong as Trump — to roll back the Clean Power Plan and/or withdraw from the Paris climate deal. But it’s possible that Trump could accomplish one or both of these, which would be a tremendous setback.', 'This deepens the contrast between Trump and Hillary Clinton. While Clinton would not be as ambitious as Sanders in tackling the climate challenge, the unalterable fact of the matter is that Clinton would preserve and implement the Clean Power Plan and the global climate accord, and Trump would seek to reverse them both.', 'Sanders has repeatedly described the climate challenge as the single greatest long-term threat we face:', 'Climate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016', 'And:', 'As a father of four and a grandfather of seven, I care about leaving a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016', 'It’s true that Sanders has criticized the global climate deal as insufficient. But Sanders surely knows that continuing to implement it — and the Clean Power Plan — are infinitely preferable to rolling them back, which could lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Sanders knows that the Paris accord may end up being our best near term hope for building an international effort to tackle the climate problem. Implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility. What’s more, even if the Paris accord is currently not enough, it can be built upon later. The accord is not guaranteed to succeed, but trying to implement and build upon it makes success more likely. Obviously, if our participation in it is canceled, building upon it is no longer possible.', 'It is often said that Sanders may not help to unify the party because he has ""nothing to lose"" from a Democratic loss. I think that is wrong — I believe Sanders when he says a Trump presidency is unthinkable. And at any rate, the incentives, if anything, favor Sanders helping to unify the party, in order to maximize his and his movement’s influence going forward. Trump has now clarified beyond any doubt just how much, by Sanders’ own lights, we all have to lose from a Trump presidency. My bet is Sanders will seize on this to make the case to his supporters that the stakes in this election require a full commitment to Trump’s defeat, even if that means supporting a flawed alternative.']",Donald Trump just made an extremely important promise. It’s one of his worst yet.,Trump would cancel the global climate accord.

From handing $5 to a homeless person on the street in Manhattan to raising $450 to give to a working father of one in rural South Africa — we believe in the virtues of sharing abundance in an empowering fashion that enables people to decide how best to allocate their resources themselves. When we found GiveDirectly in November 2015, an org that gives $1,000, unconditionally, to people who are in extreme poverty, as a solution to get them out of extreme poverty, we fell in love. Unconditional — they can do anything they want with it — which is incredibly empowering to recipients, but many people in ‘the west’ think it’s risky...or even foolish.', 'We’ve told countless friends and family about GiveDirectly, and the concept of transferring cash is met with much skepticism; soliciting responses such as ""eh, I only give people food,"" and others such as;', '""How do they make sure people aren’t defrauding them or stealing the cash?""', '""I bet most people waste or squander the cash.""', '""It probably doesn’t have long-term impact, such as building a school could.""', '""General angst about the ""Savior Barbie"" complex, where western people go out to save people in poor countries by telling them what they should do — often a self-serving endeavor.""', '...and more.', 'After dealing with the frequent barrage of opposing views, but always holding strong to our personal convictions; we decided to dig for some more answers — and see how many of these holes they were poking in our own justifications could be filled. Since we currently travel abroad full-time, and Kenya is an incredible country, we decided to head out for a field visit and take a real peek under the hood of GD’s operation.', 'Outside of GiveDirectly’s Country Headquarters in Kisumu, Kenya', 'In August 2016, my wife and I visited GiveDirectly’s office in Kisumu, Kenya and spent two 10-hour days in the field, visiting real past recipients in the Siaya (where President Obama’s grandmother lives!) and Homa Bay regions. After meeting the team on the ground and hearing about their day to day work, we were really surprised and impressed by five main things that actually directly addressed a lot of the negative feedback we’ve heard in the past:', ') The vast majority of the team are local Kenyans; only two of around 80 or so employees are expats. We think that’s fantastic, since we’ve already known that 91% of the cash that we personally give to GD goes directly into the field, but actually a solid portion of the 9% administrative cost actually funnels into creating local jobs that afford hundreds more people in East Africa the opportunity to build bright futures for themselves. There’s a huge unemployment issue in Kenya and other East African countries and foreign investment is still far behind demand, so this kind of job creation has a huge impact on the community.', 'Beyond the employment opportunity, the real incredible moments for us came when we had the chance to speak individually with a few of the locals on the team. Candidly; they are all proud to be working their asses off to improve the lives of people in their own community. We even heard two separate stories from some senior-level guys (still under 30 years old) who were driven to work at GiveDirectly after having their own first real exposure to abject poverty; even just a few miles from where they lived. They were moved to make a difference, to pour their energy every day into giving other people in their community better lives.', 'Cavin Oginga (from Kenya) — A Field Ops Manager for GiveDirectly — who applied for a job there after running a research project on GiveDirectly’s work (for poverty-action.org) and seeing what a massive impact they were having.', 'One of the most interesting stories we heard was about a young woman who received a cash transfer from GiveDirectly in 2014. She used a large portion of the transfer to cover her school fees so that she could complete her schooling, and then graduated and immediately sought employment. She applied to work for GiveDirectly (GD often has 200–600 applicants for any one vacancy) and she got the job. From living off of less than one dollar a day, to now being employed in one of the most competitive roles available, the cash transfer from GiveDirectly has completely altered the path of her life, and she will reach heights that only two years ago she would have thought to be completely unattainable for her.', '2.) There was really no ""savior barbie"" complex in the GiveDirectly operation — no one is coming in from wealthy nations and telling anyone else how to live their own lives and what’s best for them, and no one here is swooping in from some rich country on a self-serving mission ‘save the world.’', '3.) Auditing — The rigor behind this operation is crazy. They have 5 separate teams of people for each stage in the transfer process — from initial outreach through final follow-up, the recipients almost never see the same people, so there’s no nepotism, and absolutely everything is audited.', '4.) Let’s face it — ‘data’ is boring and unsexy, yet it’s likely the most powerful foundation for any for-profit or charitable organization to build upon. GiveDirectly is almost annoying with how data-centric they are. Every decision, literally every single question we asked them about why they do or do not do something, was backed by data. And we’re not talking about just any old data. We’re talking about peer-reviewed, audited, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — the holy grail of ""I’m right and you’re wrong."" Not that they carry that swagger on their shoulder whatsoever (I’m humble-bragging on their behalf), but if they’re doing something, it’s because their data, and 3 other independent sources’ data has proven that’s the right decision.', '5.) The ‘mission’ per se of how GD gives isn’t about funding what they believe will have the most ‘profitable’ result, rather, funding is based on who has the greatest need. Basically it’s the ultimate ""anti"" ruthless capitalism. I loved hearing that. (i.e. not favoring a 22 year old with a bunch of entrepreneurial ideas over a 35 y/o single mother of 4)', 'Richard Aura Ongari from Homa Bay, Kenya sits inside of the small two-room mud hut that he build with part of his cash transfer from GiveDirectly. The majority of his transfer has been spent on medication for a chronic illness. Before being able to afford the medication, Richard could not walk, but now that he’s being treated, you can find him marching all around his property and enjoying his life with his children and grandchildren.', 'Now, for the meat of it — we went into small Kenyan villages and met these people who’ve taken a cash transfer of $1,000 (3 installments over a year). Here’s the breakdown of how their money was spent:', '1.) Housing — everyone that we met improved their housing situation in some way; they were fixing the following core issues; (and FYI we didn’t see a single home that was larger than 20 feet by 20 feet (That size home would house 5–9 people))', 'This small mud shack is home to 5. Before receiving his $1,000 transfer from GiveDirectly, Samwel Odhimbo Orimba and his family lived homeless on the shores of Lake Victoria in Homa Bay, Kenya. This house, where you can see through the walls, is a major upgrade for this incredibly grateful and loving family.', 'a. Thatched roof — which leaks in every rain and must be replaced every 1–3 years.', 'i. Completely sleepless nights (who can sleep getting rained on?)', 'ii. Leads to frequent illness / sometimes chronic, and death', 'iii. Leads to missed frequently school for children', 'iv. Leads to missed work and income', 'b. No home — living with 4–8 people in a 10x12 one or two room mud hut', 'c. Upgrading home — living in a mud hut (with holes in the walls)', 'd. Dirt floor in home — constant insect infestation, including ""jigas"" which burrow in your feet causing crippling pain.', '2.) School Fees — After primary school, Kenyans have to pay $60-$70 per 3-month semester for school, given that people in extreme poverty often earn less than $5 a day for a family of 2–4 kids, that meager amount can be a mountain, forcing thousands of kids to miss out on school from 5 or 6 years old and onwards.', '3 children of GiveDirectly Recipient Eunice Awino Omondi, and 5 of their friends all living in Siaya Kenya (Where President Obama’s Grandmother lives!). Eunice’s children are now much healthier because they can sleep through the night under a steel roof, and not thatched grass that keeps them up and cold when it rains.', '3.) Food — probably the saddest of expenditures, in my opinion, but a lot of people that we met were purchasing a few month’s worth of corn to feed their families. I see it as the saddest because such a basic need, that’s consumed and gone without perpetual benefits', ""Bags of corn purchased with a portion of a cash transfer from GiveDirectly that sit in the recipients doorway / living room / foyer / children's’ bedroom / guest’s bedroom"", '4.) Other — Outside of those top three, which everyone seemed to have spent at least some portion of their transfer on, people purchased medicines for chronic illness (Cancer, HIV, etc), livestock for income, and clothing & shoes.', '5.) I’ll hide this little gem in here: Many skeptics think that large portions of the transfers will be wasted on vices like alcohol, drugs, or tobacco, or that the sudden influx of cash may increase a person’s propensity to seek these substances, however there is no evidence that vice consumption is different from others in the community who did not receive transfers.', 'With GD’s rigorous measurement and auditing, they find the effect on vice spending (tobacco, alcohol, etc.), is ""negative and insignificant,"" meaning there is no statistically significant effect on vice consumption...Here is the 3rd party study conducted by Princeton.edu', 'This finding is consistent with a publication from World Bank on vice spending and cash transfers that surveyed dozens of studies from around the world.', 'Now this ended up being a pretty diverse array of purchases considering that half were from one little village, and half from another, and for us it just highlights the variety of need that exists within any small community. I think that if an organization went in to build clean water wells, offered solar panels, mosquito nets, donate clothes, built schools or built houses — only a fraction of the gross value of the investment would be felt by the people in the community. Shoving a square peg of charity into a round hole of need. This is exactly why we believe in giving cash, and why we believe in GiveDirectly. Of course these people still have needs for more, but I can confidently say that 91% of what we give them goes directly to people who need it most, and 97% of that cash transfer served immediate needs in their lives, and I don’t think other NGOs can say the same.', 'I think a more open and participatory conversation on eradicating extreme poverty is critical in this day and age. Extreme poverty sits at the bottom of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and contributes to massive issues all the way up the pyramid; leading to widespread health epidemics, overpopulation, lack of education, lack of environmental and conservational awareness, increased violence and pollution. We’re all connected, and the more people who live in dignity, the better off we can all be. Do you think cash transfers are a terrible idea? Do you know of a better way?']","Here’s What Happens When You Give $1,000 to Someone in Extreme Poverty","My wife, Adrienne, and I are long-time supporters of unconditional cash giving.

Photo: Tom Johnson', 'This post originally appeared on VICE UK.', ""Good Cop, Bad War is the story of an undercover police officer, Neil Woods, who spent over a decade infiltrating Britain's biggest drug gangs. The book , released last week, provides a unique insight into a world of mind games and violence, where the drug trade acts as a production line for the creation of ruthless gangsters. Ultimately, his experiences led Woods to reject the way drugs are policed in the UK."", '""The logic of the drugs war only leads one way: the police get smarter, so the criminals get nastier; things can only ever go from bad to worse, from savagery to savagery,"" says Woods. Now, after having left the force, he is chairman of LEAP UK (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition), a pro-drug legalization activist group consisting of ex-law enforcement officials.', 'But to what extent are Woods and his colleagues at LEAP UK—and those currently employed in the police force—rare specimens? How thin on the ground are drug cops who think they are fighting the wrong fight? Expressing sympathy for anything other than hardline prohibition—even to their colleagues—is something of a risk in the black and white, ""them and us"" world of police culture.', 'Even so, every now and then drug cops open up about the realities of clearing the streets of dealers and drugs.', '\ue605 Neil Woods buying crack while undercover in 1995. Photo courtesy of Neil Woods', ""I spoke to Mike Fisher*, a senior drugs investigator for Britain's organized crime busting bureau, the National Crime Agency (NCA). He asked for his name to be changed to avoid disciplinary action, as his views will definitely not be found anywhere near the pages of the NCA's annual report."", '""If the NCA stopped targeting drug gangs, it would change nothing,"" he explained. ""You would see little change in the high street. Society would not collapse. As it is, drugs are freely available now. All that would happen is that dealing would be more open. But it may give us more of a chance to deal with crimes such as homicide.""', ""On the surface, it's a counter-intuitive line to take for a senior officer working within an agency for which the drug trade is a key target."", '""Law enforcement against drugs is completely ineffective and has been since the Misuse of Drugs Act came into force in 1971,"" says Fisher. ""The idea of the state protecting you from yourself just doesn\'t work. We\'ve spent billions of pounds trying to prohibit drugs, but there\'s less chance of it working than Canute stopping the waves.', '\ue605 Photo: Andoni Lubaki', 'Fisher tells me that arresting people on the streets for drugs is an endless cycle, and that it\'s the same with the larger fish. ""Whenever we remove a big guy, someone else—usually a lieutenant—replaces him within days. The more we try, the harder it gets: increased enforcement keeps these people looking over their shoulder; they become more covert about their activity, and that makes our job harder.""', 'Fisher\'s solution is to take the Portugal route: decriminalize personal use of all drugs, from cannabis to heroin, and look at legalizing production and supply. ""I believe consenting adults have a choice as to what they put in their bodies. It will also make it easier for heroin and crack users to get the help they need and free up police time to go out on patrol and deal with other crimes,"" he says. ""Ideally, production should be wrested from organized criminals and managed by governments.""', 'Surprisingly, he tells me around half of Britain\'s elite drug detectives at NCA have similar ""liberal"" attitudes to the drugs problem.', ""But what about those drug cops working below NCA level, in towns and cities across the UK? To gauge what they truly think about their daily task, you need to be a fly on the wall—so that's the exact position that University of Sheffield criminologist Dr. Matthew Bacon took. He spent two years embedded with drug detectives in a town and a major city (the identities of which are secret) in the UK and wrote about his experiences in Taking Care of Business , published last month."", 'Most officers were anti-drugs and fully supported prohibition. Drugs were seen as being behind all that\'s bad in society. This gave them a ""righteousness"" in their actions, observed Bacon. But within this, recreational drug users, social dealers, and nightclubs were far less of a crime problem than alcohol, a drug which few officers had a problem with.', 'It\'s perhaps not surprising, given the police\'s moral code, that most of the officers he hung around with viewed ""junkies"" as lazy, undeserving scumbags. In 2012, a former undercover officer who disguised himself as a heroin user-dealer, told me: ""It made me realize how bad cops can be to drug addicts. I was abused, assaulted, and threatened with being fitted up by having drugs planted on me on a regular basis.""', 'To the anti-drug teams Bacon shadowed, heroin dealers were one of the most despised groups in society, so much so that they were seen as ""police property""—objects that police could do with as they wished. ""Almost without exception, dealers were depicted as deplorable and dangerous outlaws,"" says Bacon. ""They were made the scapegoat of the drug problem.""', '\ue605 Photo: Marco Tulio Valencia', 'Drug cops, who saw themselves as ""elite crime fighters,"" had sufficient respect however for the the Mr. Bigs of the drug world. They saw those who ran professional outfits and had families at home as worthy adversaries, and a ""good collar"" for which they would earn respect among their colleagues.', 'Despite all this, there was acceptance—often expressed by officers off-duty after a few pints—that they were not waging a ""war on drugs,"" but managing an unbeatable problem in order to ""keep the public happy.""', 'One detective sergeant told Bacon: ""Sometimes I think we\'re like those [Japanese] soldiers in World War II—you know, those ones on the island who just kept fighting because they didn\'t know the war was over. Only difference is, we\'d lost the war before we even started fighting."" Another officer told him: ""We\'ve thrown everything at it, even the kitchen sink, but drug problems just keep getting worse. In the end, the drugs are still on the streets, no matter how many people we lock up.""', 'There are rebellious notions even among the rank and file. When I went stop and searching in Soho with one of the Met Police\'s sniffer dog teams in 2013, I was surprised to hear from a regular beat officer and his colleague that they thought cannabis should be legalized entirely. ""I say legalize the lot,"" one said. ""Legalize it and tax it,"" said the other. ""If someone wants to turn the sky green and the grass blue, then it\'s up to them. I can\'t see the difference between alcohol and cannabis. The official line is that drugs are under control, but they are not.""', 'I call up Simon Kempton, a police sergeant from Dorset who has specialized in drug enforcement and sits on the National Board of the Police Federation, a body that represents rank and file officers. He agrees with Woods—that the drug trade houses the most violent people in the country—but believes prohibition is crucial to taking them out.', '""I can\'t speak for everyone, but in my opinion drug policing is worthwhile, all day, every day,"" he says. ""I get it: it can seem futile when we take out someone knocking out kilos of cocaine, [who\'s] replaced within two hours. But the reason it\'s worth doing is because the drug is not just about the drug trade: it\'s weapons, terrorism, people trafficking, money laundering; it straddles the spectrum of the most serious crimes, such as murder, kidnapping, serious assault—which all go hand in hand with the drug trade.', '""We are taking out the worst people in our society. When they assault people it\'s not just a punch-up outside a pub; we are talking about sending a message through retribution and torture. These people have to protect their trade from others, so they use extreme levels of violence. You have to be the scariest, biggest person on the block, otherwise they will take your money from you.', '""Undercover police officers would not take the huge risks infiltrating gangs if they did not think it was worthwhile. Undercover drug policing is not cheap, but it\'s very cost effective. It\'s rare to get a not guilty after undercover work because of all the evidence that\'s been gathered. Yes, people can feel demoralized that they\'ve put themselves on the line, and then someone ends up getting just a coupe of years, but that\'s the way it is sometimes.""', 'However, Sgt Kempton said that for rank and file officers, policing cannabis was another matter, and that many officers sympathized with the path taken by Durham Police in going easy on low-level cannabis offenses : ""With dwindling resources, forces are having to focus their limited numbers on areas which represent the greatest harms to wider society. While policing cannabis is still a legitimate action, I believe most officers and the public would support a focus on other areas of crime.""', 'Over the years writing about the drug trade, I\'ve met drug cops who have told me that their job is similar to that of the drug user or trafficker—a series of almost addictive drug bust ""hits"" that perpetuate the game. There are some who have crossed the line completely to become dependent drug users themselves, and others who are disgusted by the stigmatization of drug users and even dealers.', 'One female drug cop I spoke to told me: ""There are some pretty nasty pieces of work out there, but some of them are just ordinary people.

When I got my results back I was not surprised. There were no big revelations and, just as I suspected, I am not related to royalty. But I did wonder if I could learn anything more from the DNA report. That search sent me down a rabbit hole that lead me to the story of Michael Usry Jr., a young filmmaker who became a suspect in the Angie Dodge murder investigation.', 'After getting my DNA report I learned that there are a number of genealogy sites, educational institutions and companies that are willing to offer you further insight into what your DNA may reveal, as long as you’re willing to upload your DNA profile to them. Some of these sites charge money, while others are simply willing to analyze your DNA profile in exchange for adding your profile to their database. I probably uploaded my profile to about four sites. One told me the type of workout supplements I should be taking, another searched public family trees for family connections. There was even one that promised to create a diet tailor made for me based on my DNA. I gave no thought to how my profile could be used by these companies or institutions down the road.', 'Then I heard that the New York City Police Department was trying to get permission to do something called a ""familial DNA"" search. What does that mean?  Police hunting for a killer in a high-profile murder case wanted to use his DNA to search New York State’s criminal database for a relative of his. They had already searched for the killer, but he was not in the database. If they could find someone related to him they would have a family name, making it easier to track down the killer.  A quick search of the phrase ""familial DNA"" and I learned authorities in California had used it to apprehend a serial killer, who had eluded them for 25 years. The infamous ""Grim Sleeper,"" Lonny Franklin Jr., had a son who was serving time on a felony weapons charge, and his DNA had been uploaded to the California criminal database. A familial search connected father and son, allowing police to finally make an arrest.', 'A little more searching and I stumbled across a blog post about a young filmmaker named, Michael Usry Jr. A familial search conducted by Idaho Falls police landed Usry in a stark interrogation room, where he was grilled by detectives and asked for his DNA, without any explanation. I tracked Usry down on Facebook and asked him to call me. When we finally spoke, he told the whole story. How his father had participated in a genealogical study through their church, giving a sample of his DNA to a public database, which was later purchased by Ancestry.com. Years later, in an attempt to crack the 20-year-old cold-case murder of Angie Dodge, police conducted a familial DNA search in that very database, and found an anonymous donor who appeared to be a very close match to the killer’s DNA. After obtaining a search warrant for Ancestry.com to reveal his name, detectives learned it was a man named Michael Usry Sr. When cops built out his family tree they found Usry had a son. Cops tracked him down and began investigating.', 'As I talked with Michael Usry, he told me he was very angry about being caught up in the investigation, but he was even angrier about something else. There was a man serving time for Angie’s murder, Christopher Tapp, who Usry believes is innocent.', 'After I hung up the phone, I started researching Angie Dodge’s murder and the case against Chris Tapp. I learned that authorities had never found Tapp’s DNA at the crime scene. Tapp was convicted and had at that point served nearly 20 years because of his own words, a confession he made to police. I was immediately struck by the fact that Michael Usry Jr. and Chris Tapp had found themselves in similar situations, 20 years apart. Both men said they knew nothing about the murder of Angie Dodge , both men had their DNA tested and both men did not match that of the killer, yet one man went to prison and the other man went home. That was the story I pitched to ""48 Hours"" executive producer Susan Zirinsky.', 'Chris Tapp, serving time for the murder of Idaho teen Angie Dodge, shows CBS News correspondent Anne-Marie Green what his life is like inside the...', 'The day both Michael Usry and I went to see Chris Tapp in prison, I was struck by how soft spoken and kind Tapp was. He cried twice that day, once when I asked about the moment in his interrogation when he began to implicate himself in Angie’s murder, and a second time when Michael Usry showed him a video of something that was shot for a documentary Usry is making about this case. It was an interview with Tapp’s wife, Lori, who Tapp had met and married while in prison. In the video, Lori spoke of how much she admired her husband and believed in his innocence. The interview was conducted shortly before Lori was killed in a car crash, and this was the first time Tapp had heard her voice since the accident. I think there are many lessons in this case, but writing strictly as it relates to the privacy of DNA databases, the lesson is this: When you trade your DNA for information you are also giving it away -- and the database you give it to, owns it. What if that company goes out of business and sells the database? Do the protections you have been promised still stand? What if an insurance company wants to know if you carry a specific gene that could increase your chances of getting cancer, or indicates a penchant for risk taking?  ', 'Right now, the judicial system is playing catch up when it comes to your rights and protections, so we should all be aware and read the fine print. There is nothing wrong with wanting to know where you came from and what your genes can tell you about your health; just make sure you know what you are signing up for. Despite what happened, Michael Usry’s father does not regret participating in a DNA study, but rest assured that his son never will.']",How safe is your DNA?,"A new high-tech, controversial law enforcement procedure has some people worried it threatens the privacy of our DNA","48 hours, familial DNA, DNA test kit, privacy, christopher tapp, DNA database, DNA, Anne-Marie Green, the dna of a killer, Chris Tapp, murder, dna testing, Michael Usry, Angie Dodge, idaho falls",,,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': None, 'spoilerPublisher': None}","['When you trade your DNA for information you are also giving it away -- and the database you give it to, owns it.

92498c20-d9a8-46ba-9a56-aa0faaea6b52,4yx8ln,why unbreakable remains the ultimate superhero movie,reddit,"['I n the Superman comics there is a character called Bizarro, a twisted, villainous inversion of the iconic hero. Bizarro looks and acts like Superman but lives by the exact reverse logic: he says adjectives to mean their opposite, he sees it as a crime to do good, and so on. There’s a great Seinfeld episode based on the character.', 'In today’s age of superhero movie ubiquity, it’s tempting to read 2000’s Unbreakable as a Bizarro version of everything that proceeded it. The basic similarities are all there: a cloaked protagonist with superhuman strength locks horns with a scheming, criminally insane supervillain. We see the reluctant hero, played here by Bruce Willis, come to terms with his powers, use them for civic protection and watch him win the girl before finally overcoming his nemesis. We get both characters’ origin stories in flashback, and both are played by Hollywood A-listers. It’s the preeminent blockbuster blueprint.', 'And yet it by no means and exaggeration to say that Unbreakable is the exact antithesis of Marvel and DC’s current output. For starters, it clocks in at 106 minutes and its cast barely extends beyond the four central actors. Nothing explodes, erupts or is shot at from beginning to end. There is no shouting. The film is shot and cut with a near-maddening degree of patience, its soundtrack almost noiseless for long spells, and it resorts to eye-catching CGI not once.', 'It may be anathema to the box-office behemoths of today, but there’s no doubt that M Night Shyamalan’s film is a superhero movie in the truest sense. Nor that, as its camera glides affectionately down the aisles of comic-book stores drinking in vintage illustrations, it shows a genuine passion for the original form that is unmatched by anything that has come since (with the possible exception of Sam Raimi’s Spiderman films).', 'The present glut of cinematic universe-forging comic-book adaptations has born some decent films and some terrible ones, but none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of Unbreakable. Remember the face-clawing tedium that was the final hour of Man of Steel ? Indestructible hero and indestructible villain throwing each other through brick walls ad nauseum, CGI skyscrapers reduced to CGI rubble at a rate of knots, the level of peril remaining at precisely zero throughout. Unbreakable’s final encounter includes not a single building flattened, not a single punch thrown and lasts all of five minutes. Instead, we see Willis’ David Dunn defeat his arch-nemesis by dobbing him in to the authorities. It is a scene of understated gravitas, perhaps the most affecting showdown of any modern superhero movie.', 'It’s also significant that the other character at the heart of Unbreakable is Samuel L Jackson’s villain. Six years before he was being driven to high-pitched distraction by those muthafuckin’ snakes on that muthafuckin’ plane, Hollywood’s keenest scenery-stealer took to the screen with uncharacteristic restraint as embittered comic-art dealer Elijah Price, barely raising his voice above a murmur throughout (and his one concession to theatricality, the berating of a customer intending on buying a limited edition print for his kid, works as a nice metaphor for how the film wants to treats its audience like adults).', 'If Heath Ledger’s Joker was so arresting because of his lack of motive, Jackson’s cane-clutching baddie chills precisely because his are so plainly stated. But while Ledger used a manic physicality to unnerve, Jackson achieves the same end through the opposite means: his resolutely undemonstrative ""Mr Glass"" is straight from the John Doe school of dead-calm supervillainy. The scene where he repeatedly sabotages a book store clerk’s attempts to wheel him out of the shop is a more effective, more affecting demonstration of directionless rage than any of the extravagant acts of terrorism enacted by his screen successors.', 'While today’s superhero movies aim for excitement via loud action and bloated narratives, Unbreakable is deadly quiet, only lightly dusted with plot and told with an everyday realism that verges on mundanity. Its sole fight sequence is unpleasant and ungainly, actively un-thrilling, shot from a distance in one unbroken take. Admittedly the film’s slow pacing can seem a bit strained at times, but it’s a directorial style that takes guts to pull off this effectively – and one that’s aged well over a 16-year period in which frenzied spectacle has become the new normal.', 'Two years after Unbreakable was released, Raimi’s first Spider-Man film became the highest grossing film of that year, taking close to half a billion dollars worldwide and effectively igniting the superhero movie boom. A decade on, Marvel’s list of past and prospective releases stands at 45, while DC having latterly leapt aboard the gravy train.

You buy a bond. Then you get back interest payment. So easy, even your great uncle Mort can do it.', 'Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent.', 'These days, things aren\'t so straightforward: The sovereign-debt markets have devolved into a bizarro world of upside-down expectations. Yields on government bonds from all around the world have been plunging thanks to anxious investors buying them for their safety. (Bond yields fall as prices rise.) And in many instances, the returns have cratered below zero. As Quartz reports Thursday, ""around a third of all developed-country government debt—or more than $7 trillion, in terms of market value—is now trading at negative yields,"" meaning that buyers are willing to pay more for these bonds than they will eventually get back if they hold them to maturity. This is remarkable. Countries like Germany have been selling short- and midterm debt at negative yields for a while, but now it’s happening with bonds dated for 10 years or longer. Investors are basically banging down the door for the guarantee that they will only lose a little bit of money over the next decade or two.', ""The most mind-blowing example of this trend is Switzerland. Last week, yields on all of its government bonds, out to 50 years, turned negative. Investors are now expected to pay for the privilege of lending money to the Swiss for a half-century at a time. Other countries are getting nearly as good deals. Fifteen-year German and Japanese bond yields have also drifted below zero. Even economically wounded Spain can borrow for a few years at a time and theoretically make a profit. It's like a bad financial-world play on a Yakov Smirnoff joke: In Switzerland, lender pay you!"", ""Why are investors settling for these kinds of terms? For one, they don't see many other safe options. The world economy still feels shaky, especially after the Brexit vote, which sent bond yields even lower. Meanwhile, stashing cash in a vault somewhere costs money and effort—you need to cover the cost of security and storage. So they're willing to pay governments to essentially hold their euros or yen or Swiss francs. The fact that long-dated bonds are going negative also means that the markets don't expect inflation to rise much down the line, which means they don't expect world growth to pick up much either. It may even be a sign that some investors see deflation on the horizon, since a bond with a negative yield could theoretically be profitable if prices fall enough in a country."", ""All of which is to say: Today's sub-zero bond yields are a sign of how deeply pessimistic investors have become about both the near and somewhat distant future. And if they stay down, they could create some nasty problems of their own. When long-term interest rates fall too low, for instance, it makes it very hard for banks to earn a profit by borrowing and lending. This is playing out all over, but right now, people are looking very nervously at Italy's banks in particular, which are parched for profits while sitting on a pile of bad loans. As Matt O'Brien notes at the Washington Post, low bond yields around the world can make it hard for central banks to ever raise rates, since the second they do, investors will rush to buy that government's bonds. Among other things, that can push up the value of a currency, hurting exports and risking deflation.""]","Something Crazy Is Happening to Swiss Bonds, and It’s a Sad Sign for the World Economy","Investing in government debt used to be a boring, pretty straightforward proposition.

Well, perhaps not always terror, but certainly mysterious lifeforms, as evidenced by a bizarre purple blob that appeared off the coast of California the other week.', 'Now, a new bemusing lump of biological matter has appeared near the shores of Bunbury, Western Australia, and it’s safe to say that it caused some fishermen a bit of head-scratching. Smooth, pink, fleshy, and unbearably smelly, this chunky conundrum simply couldn’t be identified – at least at first.', 'Mark Watkins, a fisherman of 21 years, had clearly never seen anything like it. ""When we got closer we realized it had to be a dead whale because of the smell,"" he told the West Australian. ""Its stomach was full of gas so it was all bloated up.""', ""The stomachs of whales tend to be full of gas during life, but this is normally kept under control. Floating up to the surface some time after death, the Sun's rays began to hit the whale's abdomen, causing the gases to expand and ultimately forcing the stomach to swell up. On occasion, this can cause the cetacean to explode with dramatic, gore-filled fury."", 'After drifting away from the carcass, Watkins spotted it beginning to deflate. It looked like a few sharks had turned up and taken a few bites out of the ex-whale, which had caused its gastrointestinal gas and fluids to flood out into the Indian Ocean.', 'Although the exact species of the whale hasn’t been declared, it’s likely to be a humpback or southern right whale, two of the most common types found off the western Australian coastline.', '""Seeing it was great,"" Watkins noted on Facebook.

The hardware arms race to superiority will forever dominate as the main motivation for any company not named Nintendo, or so it once seemed. Reports from around the game industry have dubbed a new iteration of the Playstation 4 the Playstation 4.5, or possibly Playstation 4K thanks to its upgraded GPU which will be used for 4K visuals and the fancy Playstation VR headset. The fact that the Playstation 4, which is still a relatively beefy system three years post-launch, needs an upgrade reeks of the days of gaming past, when kids had to walk uphill both ways to find an N64 ram pack so they could finally play co-op Perfect Dark.', 'Needless to say, pundits, hardcore gamers and industry leaders aren’t impressed. Yes, technology is moving faster than ever, but had even a whiff of this been known back when Sony was the altruistic heroes of the Xbox DRM meltdown before the launch of the next-gen systems, most gamers may have saved up their cash for a gaming PC.', 'Speaking after Microsoft’s Build 2016 keynote address, Xbox head Phil Spencer told Gamespot he doesn’t believe in the piece by piece upgrading of systems, and you won’t be seeing that with the Xbox One.', '""I’m not a big fan of Xbox One and a half. If we’re going to move forward, I want to move forward in big numbers. For us, our box is doing well. It performs, it’s reliable, the servers are doing well.

(Debit cards, EBT cards, and cash are still accepted as payment too.) Costco members who have Costco AmEx accounts should have already been sent new Costco Visa cards in the mail automatically.', 'In many ways, the card change works to the benefit of Costco members. The new Visa cards provide members with 4% cash back on up to $7,000 of gas purchases annually, plus 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back for Costco purchases, and 1% back on everything else. The old Costco AmEx card, by comparison, gave 3% cash back on gas purchases up to $4,000 annually.', 'In the case of both of the new and old Costco-affiliated credit cards, the cash back can be redeemed only at Costco. What’s more, Costco now accepts any Visa card, so you don’t need to use the one the retailer sent as a replacement for the old AmEx card.', 'And there may be times when you probably should use a non-Costco Visa card for your Costco purchases. For instance, the Chase Freedom Visa card is offering an outstanding 5% cash back on purchases at warehouse clubs such as Costco, BJ’s, and Sam’s Club. The cash back applies to purchases up to $1,500 per quarter, and while the cash back offer was originally only supposed to apply to the second quarter of 2016, it’s been extended to the entire year', 'So, looking ahead, Chase Freedom cardholders have the possibility of earning 5% cash back on up to $1,500 worth of Costco purchases (for a total of $75 back) during the third quarter (July 1 to September 30), and again during the fourth quarter (October 1 to December 31). After customers hit the cap, the bonus goes back to only 1%. Note that with the Chase Freedom card, the cash back is plain old cash back and does not have to be redeemed at Costco.', 'Finance', 'Costco']",Costco Is Making a Big Change Today That Shoppers Need to Know About ...,From Yahoo Finance: How you can pay is changing.,,"['http://archive.is/Knhth/cecc225febbe519545f37f88354dee387928bb9d.jpg', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/150f4f22e022401ce1a7d9756a3add19026e66dc.jpg', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/21bf146cc84624895cab22711cd234f1e2b23e11', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/c49ff36109da5f0113555c92224d455aaab518ea.jpg', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/63a5155b8c1152795486ee50ee58632e711e2afb.jpg', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/ff6ef0ddebe8046c97aa05cdcc4133f6c5eb71cb.jpg', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/d38ee9fd38100245ec317c3cb7fce62233c353b6', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/d7e47b9b4da43a4131c7e44adbb7307bee6b08d4.jpg', 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAMAAAAoLQ9TAAABU1BMVEUAAAABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALCwsfHx8dHR0ICAgCAgIVFRUSEhISEhIODg5TU1MFBQUCAgIDAwNJSUkTExMEBAQHBwcICAgEBAQMDAwCAgJZWVk5OTkKCgoUFBQhISEODg4KCgoAAAANDQ0MDAwCAgIBAQEjIyMCAgIvLy8AAAAVFRUPDw8ODg4QEBAAAAAKCgovLy8qKioKCgoTExMAAAASEhIODg4EBAQAAAAFBQUKCgoKCgoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABcXFwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEBAAAAAeHh4AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAgIoKCgkJCQNDQ12dnYSEhIdHR0lJSUmJiYwMDAUFBQZGRkKCgpiYmKCFFTcAAAAYnRSTlMAAAQCB+9A/gFZYMtZCwADOK7fSgEA9k8APVM3pCfZpCenzKzqGgAAABHgJpHABxMZeE4k4epZw4I8eK5zAF1oSfMhmf7HKzGF1tO0RzIxna+4zTUDJecM4KyL0GEQw2Xe1BogW7kAAAC/SURBVHheNY1Tg8RAEAY7yWZt2zbOtm2jszji/3OnZy710l/VSwOjGQbCYrPTkSRrMuWQ2Mp85ig4Xd7Rn3uRLZ+nRiHgr28EQ3IkGosnQGA+Sp9kB+/f+YLwYqlcqfZ/fjVsGHhotaHz8aYho0vem5icmh4iZ4bC7Fd/bh4FCxSUpWVYEb66BvqfdXLT5ta2rKed3b39g0PVdKxwNZ6enV8AXCJe8c/XN4i37Mp39w9APKqIT3wpIHh+eTXCP2MHbSZMouN0pwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/7dbb4a35945151f2d4562ffd466f15e4c28903c1.jpg', 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAABlBMVEX///////9VfPVsAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAApJREFUCB1jYAAAAAIAAc/INeUAAAAASUVORK5CYII=', 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/9d030e8924125b95a647edf89032efdea1e9a54a.jpg', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/d9a72fb2fca078fbc2ae5a4a5701dc33a2e9f5de.jpg', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/3abe798e6e43c5da93e9034e54731c7a44267ff8.png', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/162eadf6c7f775a987e4d3001b40ed6dbb39caec.jpg', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/f649b07d0140808519a19fc8a3a85c94a1ded90b/scr.png', 'http://archive.is/Knhth/97fc30c7f683cbe2790823527b2541709e280323.jpg']",http://archive.is/Knhth,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': '""as of June 20 members who had Costco AmEx cards should switch over to the new Costco Visa Anywhere card""', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}",['Costco AmEx cards should switch over to the new Costco Visa Anywhere card'],"[[[0, 182], [0, 255]]]",['passage']

On Sunday, RCP updated their numbers to show that Trump is now, on average, 0.2 percentage points ahead of Clinton.', 'That gap might be narrow, but it has still led some (including a senior elections analyst at RCP) to conclude ""it’s probably time to panic"". I’d disagree. For those concerned about the prospect of a Trump victory, it’s been time to panic for a while – zooming out from a single statistic shows it.', 'Delayed panic?', 'Although this might be the first time that Trump has come out on top in the RCP polling average, he has come very close to doing so on two prior occasions – in September and December of last year. Since September, Clinton’s lead has fluctuated significantly from being as large as 11 percentage points to as narrow as 0.6. In other words, there have been many other periods when Trump’s opponents should have been worrying before now.', 'Just as it took pundits a while to wake up to the fact that Trump was a sufficiently popular candidate to win the Republican nomination, it seems that they have also been slow to switch focus to his chances of winning the White House.', 'Part of the reason why they didn’t panic before was a belief that measuring American public opinion a long time before a national election is a bad predictor of voting patterns. Why? Because people change their minds. November is still six months away. The alternative view is that preferences may be becoming hardened now, making voter behavior less likely to shift.', 'Looking backward, rather than forward, results from the last six presidential elections suggest that 31 states are ""safe"" – based on the fact that the same party has consistently won them. Unsurprisingly, polling companies are investing their time and resources in states they think might ""swing"" and therefore determine electoral outcomes nationally – states like Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia. So far, polling suggests neither candidate has a significant lead in those states which could provide extra cause for concern for those worrying about a Trump win.', 'Polling on a pedestal', 'All that said, the RCP polling average is not the perfect political barometer it is so often held up to be.', 'The polling average has become the go-to number for those trying to make quick sense of the state of the presidential race. That’s problematic in itself; this election can’t be predicted on the basis of just one number, not least because a candidate’s vote share does not neatly translate to their chances of winning the White House. Each state wields a different number of electoral votes, so it matters how a candidate’s support is distributed throughout the country.', 'Democratic victories in highly populous states, which have more electoral votes to award, could cause the performance of the Democratic candidate in the electoral college to outstrip her or his performance in the popular vote. In 2008, Barack Obama won 68% of the electoral college vote with only 53% of the popular vote. Clinton may be buoyed in the 2016 election cycle by traditional Democratic strength in populous states such as New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California.', 'There’s another, much bigger problem with the RCP average, though: it’s only as good as the individual polls that make it up. RCP always takes a straight average of the five most recent polls that were conducted. Once you peek under the hood, you’ll see that an average of 0.2 percentage points flattens out some very different findings.

Although they were all conducted during a relatively similar period of time (which is essential when trying to get a snapshot of what the public thinks now), the polls by NBC/WSJ and Fox News only spoke to registered voters, Rasmussen interviewed ""likely voters"", while the ABC News/Washington Post poll simply spoke to adults (82% of whom were registered voters).', 'All polls claim to speak to a ""nationally representative"" sample of adults, but virtually none will publish data showing where their respondents were based. Perhaps Rasmussen Reports had to adjust their findings to account for the fact that they only managed to speak to two people in Iowa – we just don’t know. Languages matter too. Two of the polls mentioned above conducted their interviews in Spanish and English – it seems that the others did not.', 'Methodologies matter. They’re one reason why the footnotes in each poll mention slightly different degrees of accuracy. Take the ABC News/Washington Post poll for example – those numbers have a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points. That means that Trump’s reported lead of 2 percentage points could have actually been as high as 5.5 percentage points. Or it could be that Hillary Clinton actually led by 1.5 percentage points.', 'Polling is far from perfect.

That is especially true of the relatively rare blue whale, the world’s largest inhabitant.', 'Decimated by historic whaling practices, blue whales number just 5,000–12,000 individuals worldwide, and they are threatened by entanglement in fishing nets, environmental noise and pollution. Scientists have long used whale blubber as a record of the chemicals that these enormous creatures absorb as they traverse the ocean. But analysis of blubber does not indicate when chemical contamination occurred, or how long it lasted.', 'The whale earplug from a blue whale that was used in the study.', 'Whale earwax is a fat-rich deposit that stores the same chemical data as blubber. But it also records time — similarly to the rings of a tree, the wax is laid down in light and dark bands, with each band correlating roughly to a six-month period. In baleen, or filter-feeding, whales, earwax forms a solid plug that may be tens of centimetres long and remains intact even after its death.', 'Chemical signatures', 'Usenko and his team identified their specimen as a male aged about 12 years. During his brief life he came into contact with 16 persistent organic pollutants, including pesticides and flame retardants. Exposure to the most persistent chemicals was greatest in the first year — and accounted for one-fifth of his total lifetime contact — suggesting a transfer of contaminants from his mother in the womb and during nursing.', 'Maternal transfer of pollutants is known to happen in other mammals, such as seals and humans. Once these compounds enter the food chain, they are passed on and accumulate. ""Some of these chemicals are no longer in use, such as flame retardants that were outlawed in 2005, but they can stick around for 50 or 60 years,"" says Usenko. Other toxins uncovered from the earwax were probably picked up along the way. Mercury — which can cause brain damage — spiked twice in the sample, at around five and ten years.', 'Over the whale’s life, concentrations of cortisol, a stress hormone, doubled. The peak was directly after the whale reached sexual maturity, at about ten years old, suggesting stress from sexual competition. But it is unclear whether the overall increase was caused by natural events, such as weaning, or by human activities, such as pollution and noise.', 'The research is ""exciting"", says Jeremy Goldbogen, a marine biologist at Cascadia Research Collective in Olympia, Washington, but ""the inability to distinguish baseline stress levels from those associated with anthropogenic disturbances is a limitation of the study.""', 'The male blue whale whose earplug was harvested for the study.

Yes, Daniel Radcliffe is no longer Harry Potter -- as a recent New York Times Magazine profile deftly illustrated -- but what\'s interesting about Radcliffe (great, even) is that he\'s not anti-Harry Potter.', 'Here\'s your for instance: In ""Kill Your Darlings,"" Radcliffe plays a young Allen Ginsberg, who, at the outset of the Beat generation, finds his friend, Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), embroiled in a scandalous relationship that leads to tragedy. When I pointed out that the Ginsberg, wasn\'t exactly a connoisseur of mainstream tastes, Radcliffe defended the ""Harry Potter"" franchise. The 24-year-old may be moving on from Hogwarts, but he certainly hasn\'t forgotten, nor dismissed, where he came from.', 'Not only do you have ""Kill Your Darlings"" coming out this year, but you also starred in the Toronto International Film Festival debuts, ""Horns"" and ""The F Word."" It\'s not easy to redefine yourself from Harry Potter, but it appears it\'s happening.', 'I think it depends on the attitude you take towards it, basically. If you say, yes, ""Potter"" was the biggest thing that I\'m ever going to do and I\'m never going to come close to that again, and it\'s going to hold me back from getting parts, then probably all of those things will come true. But if you take the attitude that this is the most amazing platform, in a way, to get set for a career in the world, it\'s an amazing start to have had and it\'s something that can be capitalized on rather than being something that holds you back. And I just have such fun doing my job, as well. Like, the most interesting way for me to do it is by picking diverse, varied things -- like ""The F Word"" and ""Kill Your Darlings.""', 'And I think there\'s definitely an element of you grow up for 10 years on a set and you don\'t really have peers when you\'re 12 or 13 that you look to in other films.

And you start being fans of them and you also start kind of going, ""Oh, I want to do what they\'re doing. I want to have loads of different parts as well."" So it builds up this desire to get out there.', '""The Woman in Black"" felt like its narrative was basically, ""Here\'s Daniel Radcliffe\'s first post-Potter role,"" and now, with these, people have moved on.', 'I think that\'s a really astute observation. I think that\'s completely true. ""The Woman in Black"" was a fantastic transition because it wasn\'t so different than Harry that people were like, ""Oh, he\'s just trying to shock us."" But it was different enough that people realized it was a different reason to go and see it. And the fact that it did so well and it was a really good movie. I may not be over the moon with my own performance in it -- there\'s still stuff I see when I see that that\'s very reminiscent of Harry. I only started filming it six weeks or something after we finished the last ""Potter."" So, it came very soon after. But I do think, now, with these next three films, people will see it is so different from anything I\'ve done before. I just think I\'ve grown up a lot as an actor in the last couple of years.

Even though it was the most commercial series in the world -- in terms of the money it made and the appeal it had -- we always did try to make them as challenging as possible. I think the reason I\'m so proud of it, still, is that we made eight films that got better and better and better until the last one. That\'s not very often achieved in film and the fact we achieved it is a testament to the amount of care and love put into it by everyone who was involved on that set, all the time. So, yeah, I still think we did a remarkable thing and even if we were very mainstream -- which, of course, we were -- we brought a lot of integrity and sort of a boldness to the franchise.

For others, this love blooms later, eventually revealing the vibrant colors of a true bibliophile! But science has started looking into the effects of reading on the brain. They’ve done experiments, ran MRIs, polled, and surveyed, all to what end? Studies have been released in the past several years that have given scientists some interesting data about fiction readers and what type of fiction they should read!', 'What has science concluded? Studies are showing that readers of fiction are more empathetic towards others. By engaging with a story, readers are temporarily placing themselves in a character’s shoes, therefore, the more stories you read, the more shoes you’ve tried on. It’s a fascinating insight into the world of reading.', 'In 2012, Standford University did research into why this is. According to neuroscientist Bob Dougherty,', '""The right patterns of ink on a page can create vivid mental imagery and instill powerful emotions.""', 'Your brain does amazing things while you’re reading, the breadth of which researchers are still defining. And by placing yourself into the world of a great novel, you are given the chance to experience something new that could be informative in your interactions with other people.', 'This compassion was notably detected in children reading Harry Potter. Another experiment ""conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of Harry Potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees).""', 'The conclusion of the study was that children who identified with Harry as a character reacted to his sympathy for marginalized groups (such as ""mudbloods"") by becoming more sympathetic towards similar groups in contemporary society (such as the LGBT and immigrant communities). But this was only shown after these connections were explicated to the children and only if they identified with Harry.', 'What does this all mean?', 'Sure, we create images in our heads of the stories we read –we engage with language, we sympathize with the characters in our books– but besides Harry Potter, which books should we be reading to maximize these cognitive benefits?', 'The authors of another study, David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano, tackled this question, but also asserted that what you choose read is important! As Castano explained to Mic.com:', '""We believe that one critical difference between lit and pop fiction is the extent to which the characters are complex, ambiguous, difficult to get to know, etc. (in other words, human) versus stereotyped, simple...""', 'Through their research, they found that readers of literary fiction receive more of the empathetic benefits of reading than those who read pop-fiction or non-fiction. The term ""literary fiction"" seems arbitrary, but Kidd and Castano explain that literary fiction merely denotes the level of complexity in stories and their characters (at least, that’s what it means in the context of their study).', 'In 50 Shades Of Grey, for example, the characters are laid out. They react to each other and to their environment. By no means are these characters simple or easy, but they do not evoke the same complicated and uncanny feelings that one experiences with Nick Carraway as he narrates The Great Gatsby.', 'Reading in general helps with empathy, but literary reading amplifies this effect. By reading a challenging book, you’re not only becoming a smarter person, you’re also become more empathetic. Literature is not always easy, but by attempting to tackle harder books, we create new connections in our minds that we might not have otherwise.', 'Like opening a window to let fresh air into your home, literature opens up our minds to the myriad ideas that we wouldn’t be able to experience on our own!

f8c58e51-8e49-4d78-b9c2-b12f26308f8e,50pr3j,does your iq correlate with the rap music you listen to?,reddit,"['So the other day, I was scrolling through my timeline and came across a tweet commenting on some of the trendier rappers in hip hop right now. The tweet, which I’ll paraphrase, said that people who listen to rappers like Kodak Black, Migos, Young Thug, Future, Fetty Wap, and Lil Yachty are people who subsequently have low IQs. This isn’t exactly an unfamiliar comment that can be found online. I’ve seen tweets before that have told me that I’m stupid for listening to more Fetty Wap songs than Tupac songs in the past year. I’m not a real hip hop fan, apparently. There are a couple points I want to get to about these sorts of popular, conformist opinions.', 'First of all, the digital era and internet presence of hip hop has made the genre as inclusive a community as I’ve ever seen it. Chance the Rapper made Free (Based Freestyles Mixtape) with Lil B. Mac Miller has a song with Chief Keef on his last album, GO:OD AM. Andre 3000 dropped a lengthy verse on ""Sixteen,"" a song off of Rick Ross’ God Forgives, I Don’t. What haven’t 2 Chainz and Thugger not been featured on this decade? Rappers with completely different styles and interpretations of hip hop are frequently working together these days. Your favorite, thoughtful, wordy rapper could put out a song with your least favorite, struggle-bar spitting rapper. It’s only a matter of time before it happens (unless it already has).', 'So if a rapper like Danny Brown wants to hop on the remix for SD’s ""New World Order"" (as he did), does that mean that Danny Brown has a low IQ? Or even, does SD have a low IQ for rapping repetitive and simplistic lyrics in a sub-genre of rap (drill) that almost depends on recycling lyrics/themes? The answer to both questions is no. Therefore, it doesn’t matter if someone’s favorite rapper is Kodak Black or Kendrick Lamar—it doesn’t in any way reflect someone’s intelligence.', 'Now, I can’t really speak on the actual IQ numbers of the people I know, but I can say with confidence that I know a lot of very intelligent people who like rappers who aren’t considered lyrical rappers. My sister, who does have a gifted-level IQ, has become a big Future fan. One of my college roommates frequently listens to Migos, and he will be attending law school next fall. My girlfriend, who is an award-winning writer, and who could run laps around most people with her expert grasp of language, gets hype to Flocka like none other. My favorite hip hop project of the year (if I’m not considering the force that is Death Grips’ Bottomless Pit a rap album, which I’m not) is Lil Yachty’s Lil Boat mixtape, and I just graduated from my liberal arts college with departmental honors. And I think ""Minnesota (Remix),"" which ironically features Quavo of Migos and Young Thug, is one of the most fun hip hop songs I’ve heard all year. People with any level of intelligence are free to like any kind of music they want to. What’s wrong with putting Kodak Black’s ""SKRT"" and Kendrick Lamar’s ""The Art of Peer Pressure"" on the same playlist?', 'In fact, there’s nothing wrong with liking both Kodak Black and Kendrick Lamar. Speaking of Kendrick Lamar, I have a friend who told me once that Machine Gun Kelly was a better artist than Kendrick. Sure, I cringed and adamantly disagreed, but ultimately it didn’t make a difference what I thought. It’s never cool to make someone feel bad for what they like or love, even if the music they like might be unpopular, weird, or bad to you. It’s twice as lame to post on social media how terrible certain rappers are (rappers who could care less about the opinions of fans who they aren’t trying to attract anyway) and even worse to trash the innocent fans of these rappers.', 'There will always be pretentiousness when it comes to any kind of art. I’m guilty of it as much as I’m sure a lot of people are. But opinions on hip hop are subjective. It’s important to be open-minded. There are so many unique sub-genres of rap that are waiting to be explored that may not rely on lyrics, poetry, or message as much as maybe the sound, vocal delivery, or overall aesthetic. There’s a reason Common isn’t ever requested at the bar. I don’t hear A Tribe Called Quest during warmups for big basketball games. How does one dance to an Immortal Technique song?', 'Hip hop needs guys that make music with energy. Hip hop needs rappers who allow us to tune out their words and just feel their music. Hip hop fans don’t need to feel pressured to only listen to music that is considered smart. Smart isn’t everything, and just because a song is intellectually smart, doesn’t necessarily mean it is enjoyable to listen to. People have different tastes.

cde3869b-ebd5-4562-9fc6-60e5918bae50,4uai7m,what would happen if the olympics banned russia?,reddit,"['Imagine the most stereotypically Russian way an Olympic doping scandal could play out. Are you thinking sketchy FSB agents? Passing urine samples back and forth through a hole in a wall ... hidden behind a cabinet in a laboratory? And everything kinda sorta maybe ties back to Putin? Because then you’d be absolutely right.', 'This morning, the Court of Arbitration for Sport made a ruling on Russia’s cartoonish state-sponsored skullduggery, which has been going on since 2010: It upheld the International Association of Athletic Federations’ ban on Russian track and field athletes in the Rio Olympics, whether there’s hard evidence they were juicing or not. The International Olympics Committee is still making up its mind about that ban, but it’s also still possible it will ban the country altogether—a decision that would affect not just the medal counts in Rio, but the state of international athletics.', 'Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, builds models that forecast medal counts based on past performance, population, GDP, and other variables. In London, the Russians won four to 16 more medals than his models predicted—meaning their wins were probably inflated by doping. And his numbers have been borne out: The Olympic committee has since reallocated 11 Russian medals from the London games.', 'If the Russians competed in Rio cleanly (or, as Noland says, ""no dirtier than average""), his models suggest they’re good for 66 or 67 medals. So how many more would he expect if doping went on unchecked? If they managed to nab 11 extra medals in London, when their doping program was still relatively new, you can bet they could get at least that number and then some. Noland figures the Russians would have come away with about 80 medals.', 'If the IOC does ban Russia, that’s enough medals to throw any Olympic predictions seriously out of whack. And many of the medals that might have otherwise gone to Russian athletes would likely go to competitors from the US, as they did at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics that the Soviet Union boycotted: In the absence of the USSR, the US’s total medal count skyrocketed to 174, and fell to 94 when the Soviets returned to the Olympics in 1988. ""For the Olympic movement, it’s a huge deal,"" says David Wallechinsky, the President of the International Society of Olympic Historians. ""This isn’t Tonga or Paraguay, it’s one of three big medal winners.""', 'For the average American Olympics viewer, the absence of Russian athletes might go unnoticed. Where it most certainly will be noticed, of course, is Russia. ""You cannot separate the Olympics from politics,"" says Wallechinsky. ""That’s a myth. Russia is already saying this a Western plot."" Countries have been banned from the Olympics before, but it’s always been for overtly political reasons. Germany and Japan were not on the Olympic guest list for the 1948 Summer Olympics, South Africa was banned during the apartheid era, and Afghanistan was banned in 2000.', 'The potential Russian ban wouldn’t be that much of a departure from those decisions, because Olympic athletes’ doping is inherently political. ""If doping is done for the glory of the nation state, even if the athlete is doing it in secret with just an Internet connection and a PO box, it can take on an element of politics,"" says John Gleaves, co-director of the International Network of Humanistic Doping Research. And state-sponsored doping is the same, but, you know, more so.', 'One of the reasons that doping has remained such a problem at the Olympics is that the whole process is completely byzantine, and countries are left to police themselves. ""The anti-doping setup had led to a really lumpy enforcement,"" says Gleaves. ""How much anti-doping work can Kenya be expected to do when you look at its ranking in GDP?"" The Russian doping scandal puts a spotlight on a problem that was already systemic in international sports.', 'Which may very well drive the IOC to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility. ""The IOC is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport—and failed on all those accounts,"" says The Games: A Global History of the Olympics . He puts on his best John Goodman: ""‘I’m talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.\'"" Which may very well drive the IOC to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility. ""The IOC is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport—and failed on all those accounts,"" says David Goldblatt , author ofThe Games: A Global History of the Olympics. He puts on his best John Goodman: ""‘I’m talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.\'""', 'And this scandal seems an appropriate place for the IOC to draw that line. Look at what happened to East German athletes in the 1970s. ""At the nadir, doping accounted for 17 percent of the medals won in women’s competitions,"" says Noland. ""There was no informed consent. You now have high rates of birth defects amongst East German athletes. The stuff they gave them had incredible, multi-generational physiological damage. I regard this as really evil."" Whether you think that doping is inherently bad or the future of athletic excellence, state-sponsored doping is not in the spirit of the games.']",What Would Happen if the Olympics Banned Russia?,"Because the Olympics are always political, and state-sponsored doping sure is too.",,"['http://archive.is/kvX42/a0d35dcc1f144f724e533c02322ad2f1f84ed0db.jpg', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/8e2fba476fa12929c8e57044fd4224862cc659b8.jpg', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/6cb066f3cc322055fbc027674f9093504fe0841d.jpg', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/d80edde401b0404a95987e46c6ae800d6ddd686f.png', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/4450fbb86cdb5cc9b9cf12bb16399f3ae95ec19b.png', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/ce85099bf875533ca2a7a57869e643f88314dc50.jpg', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/0dabde7bde542821d340f80f75981c23f4a385b2.jpg', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/c4f66ffcaa2014b1c730fbf1b1bdd0c921ee39d9.jpg', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/a28dd3ac060157e2d7d11d047e8bee875d073742/scr.png', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/dae257cd8abc7aa725392bbe6006c78f3601aea6.jpg', 'data:image/png;base64,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', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/4f745675ee7f667b2fcc685e94b288330a1d21eb.jpg', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/c8728df74487f907230358a1b08ae1a1b25f9ed4.png', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/79a5c6689b557efb5f61308f3a145434bec6dea3.jpg', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/ebd66de2ae8b9ab064e7f62c12c4b4198ae86313.png', 'data:image/png;base64,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', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/54600d504feaafcf6a9810f8f602532429a2c023.jpg', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/f12f9f28bfaeb4b412e823400d68f1c99664ccdd.jpg', 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==', 'http://archive.is/kvX42/113c05fcfb6492c0d9262e1042490ed0a494eec1.jpg']",http://archive.is/kvX42,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'The U.S. athletes would win more medals.', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}",['enough medals to throw any Olympic predictions seriously out of whack.

[7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health]', 'U.S. states may differ on the details of their laws regarding possessing alcohol, adult supervision of drinking, or drinking at home, but all 50 states have maintained a minimum drinking age of 21 since at least 1988. The benefits of these laws, however, continue to be debated.', ""Advocates for lowering the minimum legal drinking age argue that the laws have not stopped teenagers from drinking, and in fact contribute to binge drinking behind closed doors and in places with no adult supervision. They also argue that the current laws haven't led to fewer traffic accidents caused by alcohol consumption."", 'However, the new review found that since the legal drinking age was set at 21, young people have been drinking less, and are less likely to get into traffic accidents.', 'In fact, the age 21 laws have saved up to 900 lives yearly on the road, according to estimates from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.', 'Teen drinking and driving rates have dropped by 54 percent over the last two decades, and the biggest declines were seen between 1982 and 1995, a period which included changes in the Federal law that pushed all states to increase their drinking age to 21.', 'During that period, the number of fatally-injured drunk drivers decreased by 57 percent among those ages 16 to 20, compared with 39 percent for those ages 21 to 24, and 9 percent for those older than 25.', 'Looking at whether setting the age at 21 has driven teenagers to drink more, researchers found that psychological and social studies on drinking motivations have not supported this idea.', ""On the other hand, many studies have found that a higher legal drinking age led to less alcohol consumption. In one of the most recent studies, researchers found that in 2011, 36 percent of college students said they'd engaged in binge drinking in the past two weeks, compared with 43 percent of students in 1988, the first year that the age 21 law was adopted by all states."", 'Researchers noted the age 21 law has had positive effects despite being sometimes disobeyed, and indifferently enforced. Instead of lowering drinking age, there should be in fact stricter enforcement of the law, they said.', '""Clinical trials have found that when college towns put more effort into enforcing the law — and advertise that fact to students — student drinking declines,"" DeJong said.', '""Some people assume that students are so hell-bent on drinking, nothing can stop them,"" DeJong said.

But is Linux getting to the point where it can take on Windows in PC gaming?', 'A writer at TechRadar remains quite skeptical about the possibility of Linux someday becoming the top gaming operating system for PCs.', 'Game Carey reports for TechRadar:', 'Evidently, Windows isn’t going anywhere, with a Steam market share of nearly 96% as of March 2016. In fact, Epic Games even recently called Microsoft out on trying to ""monopolize"" PC gaming with its Universal Windows Platform initiatives. Although Microsoft has lost sight of what PC gamers want in recent years (see: Games for Windows Live), there’s no doubt that the current Xbox head Phil Spencer wants to bring the company back to its roots, namely by integrating features (and games) from the Xbox One into Windows 10. In contrast, Valve’s attempts at making Linux not only the best place to play games from your Steam library, but actually the heart of your living room are tough to jive with. Despite making an effort with SteamOS, it doesn’t help that a number of companies still haven’t released their November 2015-bound Steam Machines after neglecting to comply with the operating system’s handicaps. There’s a clear winner here, and unless Linux rectifies its performance disparity, lack of natively supported control options and impoverished game library, the OS to beat for PC gaming will remain Windows 10. More at TechRadar', 'DistroWatch reviews FreeBSD 10.3’s new features', 'Jesse Smith at DistroWatch did a full review of FreeBSD 10.0 a while back, and now he has some thoughts to share about the new features that have been added to the recently released FreeBSD 10.3.', 'Jesse Smith reports for DistroWatch:', 'FreeBSD is a venerable operating system, often deployed on servers due to the project’s focus on performance and stability. At the beginning of April the FreeBSD project released version 10.3 of their operating system. The release announcement for FreeBSD 10.3 mentioned several features and improvements which caught my attention. Specifically the availability of ZFS boot environments, 64-bit Linux compatibility and jail improvements were of interest to me. I was especially eager to try out FreeBSD’s new jails technology using the iocage front-end. The iocage software has been presented as an improvement on (and replacement for) Warden, a friendly front-end for handling jail environments. One of the first things I wanted to do was experiment with boot environments. For those who have not used them before, a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system. Before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system. This gives us a point in time when we knew the operating system was working. We then perform any changes or upgrades we want. When we boot the system we can choose, from the boot menu, which snapshot we want to use. This allows us to effectively move backward in time and boot older copies of the system. This makes the operating system virtually bullet proof as almost any change (short of hardware failure) can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system. The PC-BSD and openSUSE projects have used boot environments successfully for some time now, but the technology has not widely caught on elsewhere. The next item on my list of things to try was 64-bit Linux compatibility. FreeBSD has a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run Linux executables. There are some restrictions though. For example, up until now the Linux executable had to be compiled for 32-bit systems and any dependencies had to be copied into place manually. There is a package in the FreeBSD repository which installs the CentOS core userland software. In essence, this gives us a bare bones installation of CentOS 6 in a directory on our FreeBSD computer. This is handy if we need to run Linux software alongside FreeBSD software or if we want to run Linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine. The final feature I wanted to look at was FreeBSD jails, specifically the way the iocage software works and how it compares to the older Warden jail management software. Jails on FreeBSD are basically very lightweight virtual machines. Part of the file system is roped off and processes can run in this area (jail) without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system. What primarily separates jails from virtual machines is jails all share the host’s kernel, meaning jailed processes must be able to run on our version of FreeBSD. In recent years Docker has provided similar functionality on Linux.

IBM’s POWER9 finds its first support, although perhaps prematurely given the silicon won’t arrive until late 2016. Whatever CPU you use to run Linux, it can now have a more complex conversation about when to vary its frequency, OrangeFS, XFS, Btrfs and EXT 4 users can all look for tweaks that enhance performance of their preferred file systems, while F2FS is now said to be rather better at running on flash storage.

f398ced0-a18c-4d29-a779-1bfb61fde20d,4m1rq8,is buying organic really worth it?,reddit,"['Buying organic food typically involves shelling out a premium. But is the extra pinch to the pocket actually worth it?', 'Last week, a Department of Agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic.', 'Organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said.', 'Producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones.', 'Though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food?', 'The answer, it turns out, is anything but straightforward. Here, we explore this hotly contested issue.', 'What the heck does organic mean anyway?', ""Organic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed."", '""By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health,"" Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post over email.', 'When it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says ""100 percent organic"" indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients. ""Organic,"" on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while ""made with organic ingredients"" is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients.', 'There’s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels. Last year, a study by market research firm Mintel found that a majority of American consumers think organic labeling is merely an ""excuse to charge more.""', ""Indeed, there’s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable. A major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say they're organic really are."", 'Still, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not.', 'A 2012 meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce. A 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and ""substantially higher"" levels of antioxidants.', 'So, what does this mean for human health?', 'According to the Environmental Working Group, nearly three-quarters of 7,000 produce samples tested by the USDA in 2014 contained pesticide residues. In some cases, these pesticides persisted on fruits and vegetables even when they were washed or peeled.', ""Pesticide exposure has been linked to all kinds of health conditions, from neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's to cancer and birth defects."", 'The jury, however, is still out as to whether or not the pesticides found in conventional foods are present in large enough quantities to actually make a difference to human health.', 'In the 2012 meta-analysis, conventional fruits and vegetables were found to have far more pesticide residue than organic produce, but the levels were almost always under the maximum amount allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency.', '""We’re exposed to a cocktail of chemicals from our food on a daily basis,"" said Michael Crupain, the director of Consumer Reports’ Food Safety and Sustainability Center, in an earlier post. ""It’s not realistic to expect we wouldn’t have any pesticides in our bodies in this day and age, but that would be the ideal. We just don’t know enough about the health effects.""', 'Some organic food skeptics have also pointed out that non-synthetic pesticides are used on some organic farms as well -- and the science is still hazy as to whether or not those compounds have ill effects.', ""When it comes to the nutritional value of organic food, there's also conflicting data."", 'The 2012 meta-analysis did not find any significant nutritional differences between conventional and organic foods. A meta-analysis published two years later in the British Journal of Nutrition, however, found that organic produce may have substantially higher concentrations of antioxidants and other potentially beneficial compounds.', 'A recent study, published in February, concluded that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids.', '""Omega-3s are linked to reductions in cardiovascular disease, improved neurological development and function, and better immune function,"" wrote study co-author Chris Seal, a professor of food and human nutrition at the U.K.’s Newcastle University. ""But getting enough in our diet is difficult. Our study suggests that switching to organic would go some way towards improving intakes of these important nutrients.""', 'As for antibiotic use in food animals, the problems are more clear-cut.', 'The Centers for Disease Control notes that ""[s]cientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food-producing animals can have a negative impact on public health"" because the drugs allow antibiotic-resistant bacteria to develop. So choosing organic meat, or meat raised without antibiotics, is better than conventional when it comes to this issue.', 'Other ways of measuring ""worth"":', 'When considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health. But as Marion Nestle, author of Food Politics and professor of nutrition at New York University, noted, choosing organic has implications for the Earth’s well-being, too.', '""When done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability,"" she told HuffPost. ""Organics are about production values. Those values are important to me.""', 'According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health.', ""But organic farming still isn't perfect. One meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit."", ""Though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers. There's also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure. Pesticides used in strawberry farms in California, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the Department of Pesticide Regulation."", 'Lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large.', '""Promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods,"" he said. ""It’s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly.""', 'According to Food and Water Watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated. The four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that’s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers.', '""Communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses,"" the nonprofit writes.', 'Many organic farms are small operations, though ""big organic"" farms do exist as well. If buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where you\'re often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce.', 'Organic on a budget', 'Regularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so Nestle suggests to just ""buy organic to the extent you can, when you can.""', 'And there are ways to do it on the cheap (or at least, more cheaply):', '1. Prioritize your purchases.', '""It is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food,"" advised Deborah Gerszberg, a nutritionist at Columbia University’s Pancreas Center, in a blog post.', 'She also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible.', '""Some companies aren’t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. This would be a good second choice,"" she said.', 'Choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice. ""The repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure,"" said Lu.', ""For produce, buy organic if you're planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable."", '""Choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue,"" said Gerszberg.', 'The Environmental Working Group\'s ""Dirty Dozen"" and ""Clean Fifteen"" lists are helpful resources on this front. The first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach). The ""clean"" list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues. These include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower.', '2. Buy in season (and local, if possible). Buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet. In addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) to get local, in-season produce.', 'Locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative.', '""The crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor,"" writes Vern Grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the University of Vermont. ""Livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities.""', 'Buying local food is a community investment, Grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient. It also supports a more sustainable food system by significantly minimizing the use of fossil fuel-based transportation.', ""It's estimated that the average American meal travels about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate, according to the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture. In contrast, locally sourced food can travel 200 miles or less."", '3. Buying generic and in bulk are money-savers too.', ""Many mainstream supermarkets, including Safeway, Target, Wal-Mart and H-E-B, carry organic store-brand options, while Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's sell organic foodstuffs in bulk. Some supermarkets, like Whole Foods, also have bulk bins stocked with organic grains, dried fruit, coffee and other products."", '4. Keep an eye out for sales and coupons. Sites like All Natural Savings and Organic Deals can help customers surface organic food deals.', ""5. Grow your own food. It might sound daunting, but growing your own produce isn't as difficult as it sounds. It just requires a bit of effort and patience. Good Housekeeping has some tips on how to start your own organic garden. Live in a small apartment? The Urban Organic Gardener website's got you covered."", 'The bottom line', 'So is buying organic worth it? Depending on your priorities, it might be. Ultimately, many experts agree that eating a balanced diet, while remaining conscientious about how your food choices impact the health of the planet and farming communities, is key.']",Is Buying Organic Really Worth It?,Here's how organic food compares to conventional alternatives.,"organic,Organic Food,Food,conventional farming,factory farms,organic produce,Pesticides,generation now","['http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_970_noupscale/574bec79130000d605383091.jpeg', 'http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_970_noupscale/574bf288130000d605383096.jpeg', 'http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg', 'http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1', 'http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_970_noupscale/574bef081600002a00f94c61.jpeg?cache=prxhym8svy', 'http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_970_noupscale/574becff130000d605383092.jpeg', 'http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif', 'http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/OrganicPrices2.png', 'http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript', 'http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/574bef081600002a00f94c61.jpeg?cache=prxhym8svy', 'http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_970_noupscale/574bf22c1600002a00f94c62.jpeg', 'http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_970_noupscale/574becbc160000ab02f94c60.jpeg', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_970_noupscale/574bec551600002a00f94c5f.jpeg']",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/buying-organic-worth-it_us_57481117e4b03ede4414733d,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'It depends!

Well worry no longer, as the legendary filmmaker has told The Hollywood Reporter that he is not only ""super excited"" about the fifth installment but that adventure will still have a name at the end of the movie and that name will be Indiana Jones!

That gives us purpose and motivation to strive forward. Yet, it can have detrimental consequences to our mental health, activating stress indicators that come as a byproduct of pushing ourselves too hard towards massive goals.', 'As psychologist Karl Weick suggests in his article ""Small Wins,"" we should make it an everyday practice to focus our attention towards the positive by counting each small win we make. By taking the Alcoholics Anonymous as an example, he suggests that the principle works due to the change in perspective. Instead of focusing on overwhelming and complex goals, participants are encouraged to choose small, achievable daily actions:', 'The impossibility of lifetime abstinence is scaled down to the more workable task of not taking a drink for the next 24 hours, drastically reducing the size of a win necessary to maintain sobriety.', 'By celebrating these small, daily wins, participants feel more confident and motivated to achieve the same satisfactory feeling the next day, and so the behavior gains momentum leading to an almost effortless achievement of the ultimate goal.', 'The Dangers of Dreaming Big', 'We are encouraged on a daily basis to ""dream big"" and set our bars high if we want to achieve great things. This phrase is an inescapable part of every motivational speech by almost every successful person who ever lived. There is nothing wrong in the saying itself, yet it tends to be misinterpreted by us, the regular mortals who are fascinated by fairy tale stories of dreams that come true to those who are brave enough to wish and focus on the ultimate goal.', 'For every great achievement ever made, there have been a million of small wins and breakthroughs that gradually led there, and this is something many people tend to overlook when working on achieving their goals. If we forget to appreciate the small wins we regularly make, the following negative consequences will appear:', 'Our sense of self-worth can be worsened', 'We risk feeling bad about ourselves and feeling incompetent when we constantly compare present state to our final goals, which can only lessen our chances of making progress', 'We are prone to the feeling of failure and depression when our goals can’t be achieved', 'The increased amount of stress we have to cope with when we work on getting it all and now is counterproductive, as it blocks our productivity and weakens our physical health', 'Once we change the perspective from big to small and break our final goal into smaller, achievable chunks, we take the pressure off and avoid the risks to our health. By focusing on everyday progress, we automatically feel much more motivated, which causes our brain to get hooked on the positive rush and the feeling of accomplishment striving to achieve more. Understanding the importance of small wins and knowing how to apply it to your everyday life will cause tremendous benefits to your goal achieving and your overall health.', 'Here is the 4-step process you can take to develop the habit of celebrating small wins:', 'Step 1: Start small', 'First of all, you need to write down your final goal, and forget about it. It sounds silly, but this will help you focus on the fragments ahead of you, which is the only way to get things done. Instead of wasting energy on planning months ahead, focus on the next day’s challenges only. Be here and now and only think one step ahead in order to move forward. This will give you the constant sense of accomplishment, which will motivate you to move forward and boost your self-esteem.', 'Step 2: Reflect often', 'Every once in a while, take some time to reflect on your progress. So often we focus on goals yet to be accomplished and forget about the progress that has already taken place. This means comparing yourself — with yourself. For example, if your goal is to lose certain amount of weight, instead of beating yourself up for not getting there yet, you should compare some older photos of yourself to the new ones. By doing so, you will get the visual proof of your progress which serves as great inspiration for future advances and inspires positive emotions.', 'Step 3: Reward yourself', 'From early childhood, we get familiar with the achievement — reward formula which makes us consider it a norm in each such situation. Therefore, if you achieve certain success, no matter how big or small, your mind expects that you provide yourself with an adequate prize. If the reward doesn’t come, your motivational fuel gets drained, making your efforts futile. So, next time when you catch yourself single-mindedly chasing a complex goal without appreciating the small wins, give yourself a break and treat yourself to a movie, favorite sweet, or a short trip with your friends.', 'Step 4: Enjoy the process', 'Maybe the most important element to keep in mind in order to maintain mental strength in a competitive and goal-oriented world is to remind yourself to be content with yourself and the goals achieved. Remember to have fun and not take yourself too seriously. Enjoy experimenting and growing.

When she emerged, she wrote about patients tied together with ropes, abusive staff and ubiquitous vermin, ""lunatics"" treated with nothing more restorative than ice baths, and, perhaps most disturbingly, patients who seemed to be perfectly sane, dumped there by a society that had few safety nets for women who were single, poor, and often immigrants.', 'Serialized by Joseph Pulitzer\'s New York World, Nellie Bly\'s accounts (later collected in a book called Ten Days in a Mad-House) caused a sensation, fueled in no small part by her pluck—she\'d begun her career by writing a scathing rebuttal to an editorial titled ""What Girls Are Good For""—though her ingénue looks couldn\'t have hurt, either. But despite prose that shades purple to today\'s ears, Bly\'s work holds up not only for its daring, but for its impact: It prompted a grand jury investigation that led to changes she\'d proposed, including a $26 million (in today\'s dollars) increase to the budget of the city\'s Department of Public Charities and Correction and regulations to ensure that only the seriously mentally ill were committed.', 'Access to prisons has been vastly curtailed. There is no way to know what truly happens inside but to go there.', ""Bly—who'd go on to get herself arrested so she could investigate conditions at a women's prison, and to best Jules Verne's fictional protagonist by circumnavigating the world in 72 days—was not the first journalist to go inside an institution to expose its inner workings. Or the last. Ted Conover also reported from behind prison walls, as did Ben Bagdikian, for whom MoJo's fellowship program is named. In 1961, John Howard Griffin ingested a chemical that darkened his skin to investigate racial apartheid in the United States. Barbara Ehrenreich took jobs at chain restaurants and Walmart to spotlight the plight of low-wage workers. Mac McClelland worked as a picker in a warehouse of an online shipping behemoth to report for Mother Jones."", ""But while such investigations were commonplace in the muckraker era, they've grown increasingly rare. Why? First, there's a real concern over ethics. When is it okay for reporters to not announce themselves as such? There's no governing body of journalism, but a checklist written by Poynter ethicist Bob Steele provides guidelines for assessing when this kind of reporting is acceptable. I'll paraphrase:"", 'When the information obtained is of vital public interest.', 'When other efforts to gain that information have been exhausted.', 'When the journalist is willing to disclose the reason and nature of any deception.', 'When the news organization applies the skill, time, and funding needed to fully pursue the story.', 'When the harm prevented outweighs any harm caused.', 'After meaningful deliberation of the ethical and legal issues.', 'To see what private prisons are really like, Shane Bauer applied for a job with the Corrections Corporation of America. He used his own name and Social Security number, and he noted his employment with the Foundation for National Progress, the publisher of Mother Jones. He did not lie. He spent four months as a guard at a CCA-run Louisiana prison, and then we spent 14 more months reporting and fact-checking.', 'We took these extraordinary steps because press access to prisons and jails has been vastly curtailed in recent decades, even as inmates have seen their ability to sue prisons—often the only way potential abuses would pop up on the radar of news organizations or advocates—dramatically reduced. There is no other way to know what truly happens inside but to go there.', 'But here\'s the other reason investigations like this one have grown so rare: litigation. When ABC News busted Food Lion for repackaging spoiled meat for sale back in 1992, a jury bought the company\'s line that the real offense had been the falsification of employment applications and the reporters\' failure to fulfill their assigned duties—i.e., repackaging spoiled meat! The $5.5 million damage award was eventually knocked down to just two dollars, but it put a chill on this kind of muckraking for a generation, and during that time, corporate and official entities built an ever-tighter web of legal protections. Nondisclosure agreements—once mainly the provenance of people who work on Apple product launches and Beyoncé videos—are now seeping into jobs of all stripes, where they commingle with various other ""non-disparagement"" clauses and ""employer protection statutes."" Somewhere along the way, employers\' legitimate interest in protecting hard-won trade secrets has turned into an all-purpose tool for shutting down public scrutiny—even when the organizations involved are more powerful than agencies of government.', ""Companies' interest in protecting trade secrets has turned into a tool for shutting down public scrutiny."", 'Or when, for that matter, they replace the government. When CCA (which runs 61 prisons, jails, and detention centers on behalf of US taxpayers) learned about our investigation, it sent us a four-page letter warning that Shane had ""knowingly and deliberately breached his duty to CCA by violating its policies,"" and that there could be all manner of legal consequences. The letter came not from CCA\'s in-house counsel, but from the same law firm that had represented a billionaire megadonor in his three-year quest to punish us for reporting on his anti-LGBT activities. When he lost, he pledged $1 million to support others who might want to sue us, and, though we won the case, were it not for the support of our readers the out-of-pocket costs would have hobbled us.', ""Shane's story will draw a fair bit of curiosity around the newsgathering methods employed.

b0d2ad72-89c7-415b-9cb4-75b966c35e74,4l2uha,a shocking find in a neanderthal cave in france,reddit,"['In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Some 336 meters into the cave, the caver stumbled across something extraordinary—a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken. Most of the 400 pieces had been arranged into two rings—a large one between 4 and 7 metres across, and a smaller one just 2 metres wide. Others had been propped up against these donuts. Yet others had been stacked into four piles. Traces of fire were everywhere, and there was a mass of burnt bones.', 'These weren’t natural formations, and they weren’t the work of bears. They were built by people. Recognizing the site’s value, the caver brought in archaeologist Francois Rouzaud. Using carbon-dating, Rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber was 47,600 years old, which meant that the stalagmite rings were older than any known cave painting. It also meant that they couldn’t have been the work of Homo sapiens. Their builders must have been the only early humans in the south of France at the time: Neanderthals. The discovery suggested that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for. They wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions. Perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were the rings and mounds for? Rouzaud would never know. In April 1999, while guiding colleagues through a different cave, he suffered a fatal heart attack. With his death, work on the Bruniquel Cave ceased, and its incredible contents were neglected. They’ve only now re-entered the limelight because Sophie Verheyden went on holiday. ""When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible."" A life-long caver, Verheyden works at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, where she specializes in stalagmites. She treats them as time capsules, using the chemicals within them to reconstruct the climate of past millennia. So when she learned about Bruniquel Cave, while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle, she had only one thought: Why hadn’t anyone dated the broken stalagmites themselves?""', 'She knew that Rouzaud’s date of 47,600 years was impressive but suspect. Carbon-dating is only accurate for samples younger than 50,000 years, so the Bruniquel material was hitting the technique’s limits. They could well have been much older. To get a better estimate, Verheyden assembled a team including archaeologist Jacques Jaubert and fellow stalagmite expert Dominique Genty. In 2013, they got permission to study the site and crawled into it themselves. ""I’m not very big, and I had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through,"" says Verheyden. ""It’s kind of magical, even without the structures."" After drilling into the stalagmites and pulling out cylinders of rock, the team could see an obvious transition between two layers. On one side were old minerals that were part of the original stalagmites; on the other were newer layers that had been laid down after the fragments were broken off by the cave’s former users. By measuring uranium levels on either side of the divide, the team could accurately tell when each stalagmite had been snapped off for construction. Their date? 176,500 years ago, give or take a few millennia. ""When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible,"" says Verheyden. Outside Bruniquel Cave, the earliest, unambiguous human constructions are just 20,000 years old. Most of these are ruins—collapsed collections of mammoth bones and deer antlers. By comparison, the Bruniquel stalagmite rings are well-preserved and far more ancient.', 'And if Rouzaud’s work made it unlikely that modern humans built the rings, Verheyden’s study grinds that possibility into the dust. Neanderthals must have been responsible. There simply wasn’t any other hominin in that region at that time. ""When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious."" Why did they build the rings and mounds? The structures weren’t foundations for huts; the chamber contains no stone tools, human bones, or any other sign of permanent occupation, and besides, why build shelter inside a cave? ""A plausible explanation is that this was a meeting place for some type of ritual social behavior,"" says Paola Villa from the University of Colorado Museum. ""When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious, but that’s not proven,"" adds Verheyden. Indeed, despite some fanciful speculations about cave bear cults, no one really knows. Nor is it clear how the Neanderthals made the structures. Verheyden says it couldn’t have been one lone artisan, toiling away in the dark. Most likely, there was a team, and a technically skilled one at that. They broke rocks deliberately, and arranged them precisely. They used fire, too. More than 120 fragments have red and black streaks that aren’t found elsewhere in the chamber or the cave beyond. They were the result of deliberately applied heat, at intensities strong enough to occasionally crack the rock. ""The Neanderthal group responsible for these constructions had a level of social organization that was more complex than previously thought,"" the team writes.']",A Shocking Find in a Neanderthal Cave in France,"A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found.","The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life","['http://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.23.6--NS/0', 'http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6463921&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1407501962855831&ev=NoScript', 'http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-906344h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript', 'http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-b0K-eQJGBXxXE.gif', 'https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/None/_R7A6312_1/headshot.jpg?1485193950', 'https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/05/CNRS_20160048_0006/facebook.jpg?1464180693', 'https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/05/CNRS_20160048_0006/lead_960.jpg?1464180693', 'http://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.22--NS/0']",http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/05/the-astonishing-age-of-a-neanderthal-cave-construction-site/484070/,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Deliberately broken stalagmites arranged in rings', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}","['a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken.

This is what they do. They are prolific and ruthless — a juggernaut of the highest order."", 'If anything, the Warriors have given the Cavs opportunities in the first two games of the series: In Game 1, the Splash Brothers combined to shoot 30 percent from the floor and the Warriors only made nine 3-pointers total. In Game 2, Golden State turned the ball over 20 times.', ""Those were windows — the cracks might have been small, but there was a gap there, and the Cavs couldn't take advantage of it. The simple truth loomed too large."", 'The Warriors made 15 3-pointers while the Cavs made 5 on Sunday, a difference of 30 points in a 33-point Warriors win — the seventh-largest margin of victory in NBA Finals history.', ""The Cavs came into Sunday's game saying they were going to shoot more 3-pointers, that they were going to go back to playing the style that pushed them through the Eastern Conference Playoffs with ease."", ""It was going to be hard — coach Tyronn Lue was clearly fond of telling reporters over the two-day gap between Games 1 and 2 that it's nearly impossible to create ball movement against the Warriors' defense, which switches assignments at all five positions — but the Cavs had to try, it was the only path to victory."", ""Instead, the Cavs shot two more 3-pointers in Game 2 compared to Game 1.

Smith, the team's most prolific 3-point shooter, has made only two shots from distance in the Finals and is shooting a 3-pointer once every 10 minutes he's on the court. The Warriors are smothering him, and he's not a dynamic enough player to create his own shot -- at least not an effective one."", 'How do the Cavs win a game in this series? It certainly appears that it\'s going to take some impressive changes and adjustments to do so — the kind of changes that look beyond Lue, who inexplicably blamed not getting to 50-50 balls and not making the ""tougher plays"" as the reasons behind his team\'s blowout loss Sunday.', 'Not being beaten in every single aspect of the game, as LeBron James said in his postgame press conference — 50-50 balls.', ""The Cavaliers are in the deepest 2-0 hole in NBA Finals history — the Warriors' 48-point differential is the largest ever through two games — and it has almost nothing to do with 50-50 balls."", ""It has to do with the Warriors' elite defense. It has to do with the Warriors' bench being worthy of a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. It has to do with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love being underachieving one-way players in a series that demands two-way play against a team that has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they'll exploit weak defenders with cruel efficiency. It has to do with the Cavs needing J.R. Smith to be a consistent offensive producer on a nightly basis if they plan on winning. It has to do with the Cavs daring Draymond Green to beat them and then him doing just that. It has to do with Cleveland changing its offensive system and defensive ideology on the fly against perhaps the greatest team of all-time."", 'It has to do with the simple truth that 3 is greater than 2.', ""The Cavs clearly haven't learned that lesson yet, and unless a truly unpredictable turnaround is looming, it's too late for them to do anything about it.""]",The simple reason the Cavs can't win the NBA title,The Cavs have dropped seven straight to the Warriors.,,"['https://archive.is/IZgS1/0e033b41f8e4f9134bd8abd63261922b1d15e278.png',

Tabloids have been speculating for months now on the status of their marriage. The couple have been sending mixed signals to the press and public for almost as long, never providing any affirmative answer.', 'Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck celebrated their eleventh wedding anniversary this week and it’s been almost a year since they publicized their separation. The couple is still seen together with their children. Case and point, their family trip to London and Paris last month while Ben Affleck was filming Justice League.', 'Neither Ben nor Jen will confirm or deny the divorce allegations. Ben still calls Jennifer his ""wife"" as he did during an HBO interview with Bill Simmons last week. Despite his unusual appearance on Any Given Wednesday, Ben Affleck was very clear once more how supportive Jennifer Garner was of him while he rebuilt his career.', 'But as recent as three weeks ago, Jennifer Garner had plans on divorcing her husband. So does Ben’s HBO appearance mean he still hopes they can reconcile? Does he still believe he can get Jen to come around and change her mind and not finally file divorce papers?', 'According to an exclusive ET Online report, a source quotes that they are making it work. They also come right out and say that they don’t know if they will ever get a divorce: ""They still have not officially filed paperwork for a divorce,"" the source reiterates.', 'ET also noted since their split, the two have established a co-parenting routine with ben remaining close to Jen and the kids.', 'They’re still legally married, but separated. They both live on their property in Brentwood California. Another source told ET: ""They’re in a good place and co-parenting the best they can.""', 'Confused? ET did it’s best to get to the bottom of this conundrum. Do Ben and Jen know what they’re intensions are? Do they share every relationship up and down with the press and let the tabloids write what they will? Or, do the pair have things worked out and simply tell the press what it wants to hear in order to keep their lives private and press distracted?', 'Radar Online has an interview with Jennifer’s father after the devastating floods that hit West Virginia. Her dad remains mum about the status of his daughter’s relationship, saying he’d leave it up to the couple to discuss their personal lives.', 'People Magazine has published two conflicting stories. One friend of Jennifer’s says: ""nothing has changed"" in the relationship: ""They’re still all about putting the kids first.""', 'Yet another report states that Ben doesn’t want a divorce and Jen has denied to friends that they’ve reconciled. The friend also said that Jen doesn’t mind that the divorce hasn’t been finalized, but she still intends on going through with it.', 'And to pile on more confusion, the same friend said that Jen really enjoyed her time with Ben and their kids in Europe. She liked spending time with Ben again. And yet another source said: ""They have a lot of admiration and respect for each other""', 'So which is it? Will they or won’t they divorce? Will Ben Affleck and Jen Garner continue to play this game with the press, teasing the tabloids while not really giving them an answer? Or is Jen dangling the reconciliation worm before ben and is ben the one who’s being jerked about?', 'What do you think is going on, CDL readers? Tell us in the comments. Keep your browser right here at CDL for all the latest celebrity gossip and news.', 'Jennifer Garner is seen departing on a flight at LAX airport in Los Angeles, California on June 30, 2016.

Li, an investment analyst from Rockville, Maryland, had tried convincing his son to join him on his trip to China. According to Washington Post, his son declined his offer and told him:', '""Dad, don’t worry about me. I will work hard, and I will be successful, and you will be proud of me.""', 'On June 25, 2015, Sam Ellis left a party in North Potomac where he had been drinking and crashed his car into another vehicle that killed Li’s son, Calvin, and a fellow classmate, Alex Murk. Ellis, a one-time star quarterback at Wootton High School, pleaded guilty on two charges of vehicular manslaughter and was sentenced to four years in prison.', 'Calvin, an extroverted football player and recent graduate at Wootton High School, had been admitted to the University of Maryland in College Park where he would have attended as a freshman. Friends remember Calvin as a football fanatic who was charismatic, upbeat and funny.', 'He was the wide receiver No. 7 on his high school football team and once had aspirations of becoming a professional football player. Li recalled crushing his son’s dreams during his middle school years when he told Calvin:', '""Son, you go back to study. You’re not going to be a football player. You are Chinese.""', 'That moment would become one of his greatest regrets. Li, a Chinese immigrant who arrived to the United States during his twenties, reflected after his son’s passing:', '""If I knew what I know now, I would’ve been a much better parent.', '""When I look back, I cannot forgive myself. Even though I know maybe in reality he would not be a football player. But it was just the way I shattered his dream when he was small ... And I know for sure, there are other Chinese parents who are doing the same to their children right now. And I don’t want that to happen.""', 'Li recognized his son’s struggle to reconcile the dual Chinese and American cultures in which he was raised. As a child, Calvin attended Chinese school on the weekends and excelled in Mandarin. However, as he grew up, Calvin began distancing himself from his parents’ cultural traditions and values.', 'As a teenager, Calvin strove to be more Americanized and had no interest in eating out at Chinese restaurants with his parents, listening to Chinese news or traveling to Asia. He wanted to break away from the kind of stereotypes that are linked to Asian Americans such as academic excellence in math and science. Li said:', '""So his [Calvin’s] way of doing that was to distance himself from anything Chinese. I felt that’s not the right way of dealing with identity, but at the time I was not aware of this issue. I was not understanding enough to help him. I was just forcefully saying, you know, ‘You’re a Chinese kid.’""', 'Calvin associated with few other Asian students in his social circle and while he maintained good grades, his passion wasn’t academics. Li struggled to understand his son’s avoidance of his cultural heritage and desire to adopt an all-American attitude growing up.', '""Society often thinks, Asian kids — they’re doing well in school, they’re working hard they tend to be overachievers, they don’t have any problems. But in fact, they do have problems, and many of the problems are overlooked by not only their parents but also by the society.""', 'In March, Li established a foundation name for his son and announced that he will be donating $1.2 million over the span of three years for a University of Maryland fellowship. The fellowship will be dedicated to studying the kinds of issues facing the children of Asian American immigrants involving family dynamics, identity formation and cultural gaps.', 'Janelle Wong, the director of Asian American Studies at University of Maryland, believes such families will benefit from the research findings that will be presented at lectures and community workshops.', '(Visited 40,955 times, 1 visits today)']",Chinese Father Realizes His Greatest Regret After His Son Dies in Car Accident,,,"['http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/chinese-parents-300x180.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1-36-80x80.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nextnext.png', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-24-at-1.31.22-PM-80x80.png', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/plugins/user-avatar/user-avatar-pic.php?src=http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/avatars/5/1406934743-bpfull.jpg&w=50&id=5&random=1406934743', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-24-at-1.31.22-PM-300x180.png', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/drunk-driving-car-crash2.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/armless5-80x80.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/steph-murphy-80x80.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/drunk-driving-car-crash4.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/poor1-e1488592762358-300x180.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/liveanimalkeychains-80x80.png', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/team-usa-rio-olympics-80x80.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/poor1-e1488592762358-80x80.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-06-at-6.17.00-PM-80x80.png', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/A-11-80x80.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/drunk-driving-car-crash3.jpeg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/seoul-1510336_960_720-e1488591439350-80x80.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/team-usa-rio-olympics-300x180.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/palawan-300x180.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/liveanimalkeychains-300x180.png', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/logo-flex-footer.png', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-06-at-6.17.00-PM-300x180.png', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/seoul-1510336_960_720-e1488591439350-300x180.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/A-11-300x180.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/drunk-driving-car-crash1.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/steph-murphy-300x180.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/palawan-80x80.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/chinese-parents-80x80.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/niceguys-e1452799836423.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/armless5-300x180.jpg', 'http://nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1-36-300x180.jpg']",http://nextshark.com/paul-li-calbin-li-drunk-driving-accident/,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Made him study instead of let him play football', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}","['""Son, you go back to study.

2b64670d-6638-4485-859e-68ea87a7a7fd,790154060259295232,this is the difference between a job and a calling,Twitter,"['I’ve learned that work is most fulfilling when it’s a calling. And often, it’s a calling because you find a deep sense of purpose and positive impact in your role. And fortunately, the data show that purpose is incredibly tied to both business and personal success. In Corporate Culture and Performance, authors John Kotter and James Heskett write that purposeful, value-based companies outperform their counterparts with 400% higher revenues, 700% greater job growth and 1,200% higher stock prices. But having purpose doesn’t only impact the organization you work for; it also impacts you. Research from the Hay Group shows that highly engaged employees are, on average, 50% more likely to exceed expectations than their least engaged counterparts. As a result, I believe that, to be both successful and fulfilled, it is crucial to understand what purpose means to you.', 'Granted, finding your purpose is a proactive pursuit. Many people start to explore their feelings when they’re unhappy, dissatisfied with their job and/or upset with their personal life. But it is important to find time to reflect when you find yourself in a good place, too. When you’re experiencing fulfillment and joy in your work or in your personal life, take a moment to ask yourself, ""What am I doing right now that is making me fulfilled?"" Are you helping someone? Are you coding? Are you being creative? Are you creating the best financial model the world has ever seen? The answers to this question often bring to the surface what is important to you and can help you recreate that satisfaction moving forward.', 'I’ve also found it helpful to create a personal vision for your life. Spend some time thinking about what your ideal day would be like. I keep a ""dream book"" myself, and I’ve filled it with things that are important to me—from building a great tech company that is tackling a hard but important problem to building and maintaining lifelong friendships to checking items off of my travel bucket list. It even includes a picture of a well-landscaped backyard because that’s been on my list of projects to tackle—and trust me, you need vision to see beyond the weeds that are back there today.', 'So spend time creating a vision for your life. Ask yourself key questions about the role that purpose will play. Trust me, your vision can and will change over time. But knowing what you want your life to look like and then working to establish annual, monthly or even daily goals and habits to help you live that life—in and out of the workplace—is absolutely key to success. And more importantly, it is absolutely key to finding your passion for life.']",The Difference Between a Job and a Calling,You should start before you begin to feel unhappy in your work,"purpose, finding, career, calling, career option, best career, find career, find calling, career calling","['https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/work-office.jpg?quality=85&w=600&h=336&crop=1', 'https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/megan-markle.jpg?quality=85&w=300&h=168&crop=1', 'http://i2.wp.com/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/woman-emails-signature.jpg?crop=0px%2C410px%2C7360px%2C4140px&resize=300%2C168&quality=85&strip&ssl=1', 'https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/work-office.jpg?quality=85&w=940&h=528&crop=1', 'https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/breast-cancer-surgery-masectomy.jpg?quality=85&w=300&h=168&crop=1', 'https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/lindsey-vonn-body-confidence.jpg?quality=85&w=300&h=168&crop=1', 'http://i1.wp.com/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/kim-kardashian-lip-ring.jpg?crop=2px%2C136px%2C1266px%2C710px&resize=300%2C168&quality=85&strip&ssl=1', 'http://i0.wp.com/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/natalie-portman-benjamin-millipied.jpg?crop=0px%2C9px%2C2100px%2C1180px&resize=300%2C168&quality=85&strip&ssl=1', 'http://ti.me/images/motto-logo.jpg', 'http://i0.wp.com/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/clean-eating-tips-bacon.jpg?crop=0px%2C270px%2C5111px%2C2874px&resize=300%2C168&quality=85&strip&ssl=1', 'http://i2.wp.com/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/janusz-korwin-mikke.jpg?crop=0px%2C490px%2C2270px%2C1276px&resize=300%2C168&quality=85&strip&ssl=1', 'https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/gettyimages-611183146.jpg?quality=85&w=300&h=168&crop=1']",http://ti.me/2eCJV3W,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Writing clickbait: a job\n\nSpoiling clickbait: a calling https://t.co/vVDGu1ycqp', 'spoilerPublisher': 'SavedYouAClick'}",['it’s a calling because you find a deep sense of purpose and positive impact in your role'],"[[[0, 74], [0, 162]]]",['passage']

One tree was in Finland and the other in Austria, and both were monitored from dusk until morning on dry, windless nights in September. This was close to the solar equinox, when daylight and nighttime are about equal. [What Is the Oldest Tree in the World?]', 'The laser scanners used infrared light to illuminate different parts of the tree, each for fractions of a second. This provided enough detail to map each tree within minutes, the researchers said.', ""The silver birches' branches and leaves sagged at night; they reached their lowest position a few hours before sunrise, and then perked up again during the wee hours of the morning, the researchers found."", ""Trees might sleep after dark, according to precise laser measurements that detected the plants' branches drooping at night. Credit: Eetu Puttonen"", '""Our results show that the whole tree droops during night, which can be seen as position change in leaves and branches,"" study lead author Eetu Puttonen, a researcher at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute, said in a statement. ""The changes are not too large, only up to 10 centimeters [4 inches] for trees with a height of about 5 meters [16 feet].""', 'It\'s unclear if the sun ""woke up"" the trees or if they relied on their own internal circadian rhythm, the researchers said. But ""the fact that some branches started returning to their daytime position already before sunrise would suggest this [internal circadian clock] hypothesis [is right],"" the researchers wrote in the study, which was published online on Feb. 29, 2016, in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science.', ""The finding isn't too surprising, but oddly enough it hadn't been studied until now, the researchers said. Most living organisms have day and night circadian rhythms, and any gardener will notice that some plants open their flowers in the morning and that some trees close their leaves at night, the researchers said."", 'The famed botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) found that flowers confined to a dark cellar still opened and closed, and naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) noted that the nocturnal movement of leaves and stalks on plants looked like sleep.', 'However, their studies concentrated on small plants grown in pots. The finding in trees represents the first study to use lasers to precisely measure the nighttime movements of wild trees, the researchers said.', ""The tree study didn't address why the branches and leaves drooped at night, but it's likely related to the turgidity, or the internal water pressure within the tree, the researchers said."", '""Plant movement is always closely connected with the water balance of individual cells, which is affected by the availability of light through photosynthesis,"" said study co-author András Zlinszky, a researcher at the Centre for Ecological Research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. [How Tall Can Trees Grow?]', 'The researchers said in the future, they plan to examine the water movement within each tree and compare it to measurements made by the laser scans.

But the bank’s real treasures aren’t in some vault, they’re in plain sight—the ADB canteen offers scrumptious meals from several Asian cuisines at affordable prices, as well as a bakery that serves up all kinds of breads, pies, and pastries.', ""While the bibimbap, tempura bento, and walnut pie might all be worth breaking and entering for, the real crown jewels of the ADB canteen are the chocolate crinkles baked in-house daily. You hear about them—the cookies in that really strict building. They've become a legend on their own, and out of reach. And just like clockwork, a queue forms every day at mid-afternoon for these hockey pucks from heaven."", 'Time your appointment just right and fall in line for the chocolate crinkles (P14/piece). While you’re at it, pick up some brewed coffee at just P11 (bring your own tumbler or shell out P10 for a paper cup!) and take your double handful of happiness out to a bench in the courtyard.', 'For the price, these crinkles are huge—each one is three inches in diameter and half an inch thick, with considerable heft to it. Pull a crinkle apart—it’s very dense, and very moist. I love that it’s really more like a half-baked, dollar pancake-shaped brownie than your typical small, dry, boring convenience store crinkle. The surface, lightly dusted with confectioner’s sugar, just barely holds the structure together, and provides a subtle, cookie-like textural contrast to the chewy interiors.', 'Pop it in your mouth and you’ll find that the dark, bittersweet chocolate is as rich and rewarding as it looks. There’s no doubt that the bakers don’t scrimp on the good stuff. In fact, these crinkles are so decadent, I have trouble finishing more than one at a time. They’re the best I’ve had in Manila because unlike others, they’re well-balanced—the sweetness is just right and isn’t overwhelming, thanks to the good chocolate worked skillfully by the bakers, and the delicate touch taken with the confectioner’s sugar.', ""I'd go through ADB's airport-level security just to have it over and over again."", 'So if your work brings you to ADB, share the opportunity presented with a lucky few and grab as many as you can (which is strictly limited to 20 per person—I guess crinkle hoarding is a thing!).', ""The Undercover Eater works with food on a daily basis and hunts for hidden gems in his spare time.

(Photo: Ron Jenkins/Getty Images)', 'Last week, Kenneth W. Starr was stripped of his title as president of Baylor University after an independent investigation found that the university had mishandled sexual assault accusations against football players. Football head coach Art Briles was also fired as a result of the investigation. Starr, who will continue to serve as both chancellor and a law professor, gained notoriety as an independent counsel for his investigation of President Bill Clinton, the New York Times reports:', 'Mr. Starr’s demotion delivered a twist to the biography of a man whose reputation was built on what many considered an overzealous pursuit of allegations of sexual transgressions by Mr. Clinton. Now he is being punished for leading an administration that, according to a report from an ostensibly independent investigator, looked the other way when Baylor football players were accused of sex crimes, and sometimes convicted of them.', 'The relationship between athletes and sexual assault is a decades-old discussion. Since at least the 1980s, high-profile rape cases involving famous athletes have led the press to speculate on whether players might be more prone to committing acts of sexual violence. A string of sexual assault allegations in recent years has ensured that college athletic programs and the athletes that populate them will remain in the spotlight. In the last two years alone, players from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, Florida State University, and the University of Oregon have made headlines for assault allegations. More than 160 higher education institutions are under investigation by the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights for sexual violence allegations. But are athletes actually more likely to commit sexual assaults, or are we just more likely to pay attention when they’re the ones accused of committing the crime?', 'One factor to consider is that sexual violence does not occur in a vacuum. Anthropological research suggests that, rather than a purely psychological- or biological-driven act, sexual assaults are also highly influenced by culture. Peggy Sanday, an emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, found that some societies are more prone to rape than others; tribal societies with higher levels of male dominance, sex segregation, and tolerance of interpersonal violence had higher rates of rape. In other words, some environments can encourage sexual aggression.', 'The recent investigation into Baylor concluded that university officials ""created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.""', 'College athletics are highly sex segregated, extremely male dominated, and, at least in the case of some sports — football and hockey, for example — violent by design. While no university could be accused of explicitly encouraging sexual assault, several have been blamed for condoning such behaviors, or sweeping assault allegations under the rug. The recent investigation into Baylor, for example, concluded that university officials ""created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.""', 'And the perceived lack of consequences for star athletes might embolden them to behave in sexually aggressive ways. Consider surveys that have found that between one in six and one in three men would be willing to ""use force"" to obtain sex from women as long as there were no consequences for their actions.', 'While members of sports teams — and other male-dominated groups like fraternities and the military — are indeed more likely to commit gang rapes than the average person, there are few conclusive studies to show that athletes are more likely to commit sex crimes. There is some evidence that not all athletes are equally likely to be violent, according to Laura Finley, a sociologist at Barry University. Finley told Wisconsin Public Radio that players of ""power and performance sports"" — football, hockey, wrestling, and basketball — commit violent crimes more often that their peers in sports like swimming or tennis. An analysis of National Football League players by Benjamin Morris at FiveThirtyEight showed that, though the football stars displayed lower levels of domestic and sexual violence than the national average, the rate of domestic violence was still much higher than expected given their income bracket.', 'Without better data, it’s hard to say anything definitive on the matter. Even the oft-cited statistic that one in three sexual assaults on college campuses are carried out by athletes dates back not to a scientific study, but to a 1986 Philadelphia Daily News article. (One 1995 study did, however, find that male athletes were overrepresented in reports of sexual assault on campuses.) Literature reviews, which are usually useful for identifying patterns in the sea of conflicting single studies that science produces, are also unreliable here: One recent review found that the bulk of research on the subject was inconclusive; another, however, found higher rates of violence among student athletes.', 'We can at least say with certainty that universities have not been effective in handling the cases of sexual misconduct by athletes. A 2014 survey found that, in more than one-fifth of universities, the athletic department oversaw cases involving sexual assault allegations against athletes, prompting the National Collegiate Athletic Association to issue a resolution that athletic departments can only participate in, but never lead, investigations into such allegations. Still, the recent investigation at Baylor found that the university’s football program frequently dealt with sexual assault allegations internally.']",Are Student Athletes More Likely to Commit Sexual Assault?,"An investigation found that Baylor University had mishandled sexual assault accusations against its football players.

They recommend voting for a third-party or write-in candidate.', 'As a professor who has taught Christian ethics for 39 years, I think their analysis is incorrect. Now that Trump has won the GOP nomination, I think voting for Trump is a morally good choice.', 'American citizens need patience with each other in this difficult political season. Close friends are inevitably going to make different decisions about the election. We still need to respect each other and thank God that we live in a democracy with freedom to differ about politics. And we need to keep talking with each other – because democracies function best when thoughtful citizens can calmly and patiently dialog about the reasons for their differences. This is my contribution to that discussion.', 'A good candidate with flaws', 'I do not think that voting for Donald Trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a flawed candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent. In fact, it is the morally right thing to do.', 'I did not support Trump in the primary season. I even spoke against him at a pastors’ conference in February. But now I plan to vote for him. I do not think it is right to call him an ""evil candidate."" I think rather he is a good candidate with flaws.', 'He is egotistical, bombastic, and brash. He often lacks nuance in his statements. Sometimes he blurts out mistaken ideas (such as bombing the families of terrorists) that he later must abandon. He insults people. He can be vindictive when people attack him. He has been slow to disown and rebuke the wrongful words and actions of some angry fringe supporters. He has been married three times and claims to have been unfaithful in his marriages. These are certainly flaws, but I don’t think they are disqualifying flaws in this election.', 'On the other hand, I think some of the accusations hurled against him are unjustified. His many years of business conduct show that he is not racist or anti-(legal) immigrant or anti-Semitic or misogynistic – I think these are unjust magnifications by a hostile press exaggerating some careless statements he has made. I think he is deeply patriotic and sincerely wants the best for the country. He has been an unusually successful problem solver in business. He has raised remarkable children. Many who have known him personally speak highly of his kindness, thoughtfulness, and generosity. But the main reason I call him ""a good candidate with flaws"" is that I think most of the policies he supports are those that will do the most good for the nation.', 'Seek the good of the nation', 'Should Christians even try to influence elections at all? Yes, definitely. The apostle Peter says Christians are ""exiles"" on this earth (1 Peter 1:1). Therefore I take seriously the prophet Jeremiah’s exhortation to the Jewish people living in exile in Babylon:', '""Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare"" (Jeremiah 29:7).', 'By way of modern application, I think Christians today have a similar obligation to vote in such a way that will ""seek the welfare"" of the United States. Therefore the one overriding question to ask is this: Which vote is most likely to bring the best results for the nation?', 'If this election is close (which seems likely), then if someone votes for a write-in candidate instead of voting for Trump, this action will directly help Hillary Clinton, because she will need one less vote to win. Therefore the question that Christians should ask is this: Can I in good conscience act in a way that helps a liberal like Hillary Clinton win the presidency?', 'Under President Obama, a liberal federal government has seized more and more control over our lives. But this can change. This year we have an unusual opportunity to defeat Hillary Clinton and the pro-abortion, pro-gender-confusion, anti-religious liberty, tax-and-spend, big government liberalism that she champions. I believe that defeating that kind of liberalism would be a morally right action. Therefore I feel the force of the words of James: ""Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin"" (James 4:17).', 'Some may feel it is easier just to stay away from this messy Trump-Clinton election, and perhaps not even vote. But the teachings of Scripture do not allow us to escape moral responsibility by saying that we decided to do nothing. The prophet Obadiah rebuked the people of the Edom for standing by and doing nothing to help when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem: ""On the day that you stood aloof, on the day that . . . foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them."" (Obadiah 1:11).', 'I am writing this article because I doubt that many ""I can’t vote for Trump"" Christians have understood what an entirely different nation would result from Hillary Clinton as president, or have analyzed in detail how different a Trump presidency would be. In what follows, I will compare the results we could expect from a Clinton presidency with what we could expect from a Trump presidency.', 'The Supreme Court with Clinton as president', 'Hillary Clinton would quickly replace Justice Scalia with another liberal like Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan. This would give liberals a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court even without Justice Kennedy, and 6-3 when he votes with them.', 'But that is not all. Justice Ginsburg is 83, and she has had colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and has a heart stent. Justice Kennedy is 80. Justice Breyer is 78. A President Clinton could possibly nominate three or four justices to the Supreme Court, locking in a far-left activist judiciary for perhaps 30 or more years. She could also add dozens of activist judges to federal district courts and courts of appeals, the courts where 99% of federal lawsuits are decided. Judicial tyranny of the type we have seen when abortion rights and same-sex marriage were forced on the nation would gain a permanent triumph.', 'The nation would no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representatives, but by unelected, unaccountable, activist judges who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree. And there would be nothing in our system of government that anyone could do to stop them.', 'That is why this election is not just about Hillary Clinton. It is about defeating the far left liberal agenda that any Democratic nominee would champion. Liberal Democrats are now within one Supreme Court justice of their highest goal: gaining permanent control of the nation with a five vote majority on the Supreme Court, and then relentlessly imposing every liberal policy on the nation not through winning elections but through a relentless parade of one Supreme Court decision after another.', 'Even if Clinton were to drop out of the race (perhaps due to additional shocking email disclosures, for example), our choice in the election would be just the same, because any other Democratic nominee would appoint the same kind of liberal justices to the Court.', 'Abortion', 'On abortion, a liberal court would probably find the ban on partial-birth abortion to be unconstitutional (it was upheld by only a 5-4 majority in Gonzalez v. Carhart, 2007). In addition, the court could find an absolute ""right to abortion"" in the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and then sweep away with one decision most or all of the restrictions on abortion that pro-life advocates worked for tirelessly over the last 43 years, including ultrasound requirements, waiting periods, parental consent requirements, and prohibitions on non-doctors performing abortions.', 'Voters should not doubt the power of the Supreme Court to abolish all these laws restricting abortions. Think of the power of the Obergefell v. Hodges 5-4 decision in June, 2015. It instantly nullified all the work that thousands of Christians had done over many years in persuading the citizens of 31 states to pass constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. But no one is campaigning for such laws or amendments anymore, because it would be futile. The Supreme Court has spoken, and therefore the issue is settled in the political system of the United States. We lost – not at the ballot box, but because we had a liberal Supreme Court that nullified the democratic process regarding the definition of marriage.', 'So it would certainly be with any efforts to place legal limitations on abortion. Nobody would campaign any more for laws to limit abortions, because any such laws would be unconstitutional. The legislative lobbying work of pro-life advocacy groups would be totally and utterly defeated. Millions of unborn children would continue to die.', 'Religious liberty', 'The current liberal agenda often includes suppressing Christian opposition to its views. So a liberal court would increasingly nullify rights of conscience with respect to forced participation in same-sex marriage ceremonies or expressing moral objections to homosexual conduct. Already Christians are being pushed out of many occupations. Florists, bakers, and professional photographers have had their businesses destroyed by large fines for refusal to contribute their artistic talents to a specific event, a same-sex wedding ceremony to which they had moral objections.', 'Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran in Atlanta was removed from his job because of self-publishing a religious book that briefly mentioned the Bible’s teachings regarding non-marital sexual conduct, including homosexuality, amidst a host of other topics. His situation holds ominous implications for any Christians who hold public sector jobs. In our military services, many high-ranking officers have quietly been forced to resign because they were unwilling to give support to the homosexual agenda.', 'Mozilla/Firefox CEO Brendan Eich was pushed out from his own company merely because he had donated money to Proposition 8 in California, supporting marriage between one man and one woman. This event has troubling implications for Christians in any corporate executive role who dare to support a political position contrary to the liberal agenda.', 'Last year Boston urologist Paul Church, a Harvard Medical School faculty member, lost his hospital privileges at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center because he had expressed concerns about the medical dangers associated with same-sex activity.', 'Are my predictions about this kind of loss of religious liberty too grim? The three conservative justices still on the Supreme Court expressed similar concerns just last month. The case concerned a Washington pharmacy that has been owned for 70 years by the Stormans family, who are committed Christians. They will likely now be put out of business by the Washington State Pharmacy Board for refusing to dispense an abortion-causing prescription drug. On June 28, 2016, the Supreme Court refused to hear the Stormans’ appeal, in spite of the strong dissent written by Justice Alito (joined by Roberts and Thomas):', '""At issue are Washington State regulations that are likely to make a pharmacist unemployable if he or she objects on religious grounds to dispensing certain prescription medications. . . . . there is much evidence that the impetus for the adoption of the regulations was hostility to pharmacists whose religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception are out of step with prevailing opinion in the State . . . . If this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern."" (italics added)', 'Christian business owners', 'If Clinton appoints just one more liberal justice, it is likely that many Christian business owners will be targeted. Hobby Lobby won its 2014 Supreme Court case (again 5-4), so it was not compelled to dispense abortifacients to its employees, but that case could be reversed (the four liberal justices in the minority, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, are still on the court). If that case is overturned, it would force Hobby Lobby out of business, because the Green family had said they would shut down the company of 23,000 employees and over $3 billion in annual sales if they lost the decision. The implications for other Christian business owners with pro-life convictions are ominous.', 'These incidents show that it is not an exaggeration to say that, under a liberal Supreme Court resulting from Hillary Clinton’s election, Christians would increasingly experience systematic exclusion from hundreds of occupations, with thousands of people losing their jobs. Step-by-step, Christians would increasingly be marginalized to the silent fringes of society. Is withholding a vote from Donald Trump important enough to pay this high a price in loss of freedom?', 'Some Christians have even hinted to me that ""persecution would be good for us."" But the Bible never encourages us to seek persecution or hope for it. We should rather work to prevent such oppression of Christians, just as Jesus taught us to pray, ""Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil"" (Matthew 6:13). Paul did not encourage us to pray that God would give us bad rulers but good ones who would allow us to live a peaceful life:', '""I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way."" (1Timothy 2:1)', 'Christian schools and colleges', 'A liberal Supreme Court would also impact education. Christian colleges would likely be found guilty of ""discrimination"" if they required adherence to the Bible’s standards regarding sexual conduct, or even required affirmation of primary Christian beliefs. Campus ministries like Cru and InterVarsity have already been forced off of many university campuses following the 5-4 Supreme Court decision CLS v. Martinez (2010), which upheld the exclusion of the Christian Legal Society from the campus of Hastings College of Law in San Francisco. And now California’s Equity in Higher Education Act (SB 1146), which recently passed the California state senate and will likely become law, would prohibit Christian colleges from requiring students or employees to hold Christian beliefs or abide by biblical moral standards regarding sexual conduct, and would prohibit colleges from assigning housing based on a student’s biological sex if a student claimed to be transgender. Colleges like Biola and Azusa Pacific could not long survive under those regulations.', 'With regard to elementary and high schools, laws promoting school choice or tuition voucher programs would likely be declared unconstitutional if they allowed such funding to go to Christian schools. A tax credit program for scholarships to private schools, including Christian institutions, was only upheld by a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn in 2011, and all four liberal justices who voted against it are still on the court. Another possible target of the liberal agenda would be laws that allow for home schooling, if the secular/ liberal governmental hostility to home schooling in European countries is any indicator.', 'Churches', 'Churches would not be exempt from the impact of a liberal Supreme Court. The court could rule that any school district is allowed to ban churches from renting school buildings on Sundays, an action that could severely hinder the work of small churches and church planting in general. (This was already the ruling of the Second Circuit in the Bronx Household of Faith case regarding New York City public schools.) And some churches in Iowa have now been told that they have to make their bathrooms open to people on the basis of their ""gender identity"" if the churches are going to be open to the public at all.', 'Freedom of speech', 'Freedom of speech would be increasingly restricted in the public square. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that prayers of visiting pastors who prayed ""in Jesus’ name"" when they opened a city council meeting were allowed under the Constitution, but again it was a 5-4 decision (Town of Greece v. Galloway) and all four liberals who wanted to restrict such prayers are still on the court.', 'Criminalizing dissent', 'Another troubling possibility is that liberal activists, once in power, would further entrench themselves by criminalizing much political dissent. We have already seen it happen with the IRS targeting of conservative groups and with some state attorneys general taking steps to prosecute (!) groups who dare to disagree with activists’ claims about the danger of man-made global warming.', '""But my conscience won’t let me vote for Donald Trump,"" some have told me. But I wonder if their consciences have considered the gravity of these destructive consequences that would come from a Clinton presidency. A vote for Trump would at least be doing something to prevent these things.', 'In addition, I think there are several positive reasons to vote for Trump.', 'The Supreme Court with Trump as president', 'Trump has released a list of 11 judges to show the kind of nominee he would appoint to the Supreme Court. A lawyer familiar with many of these names has told me that they constitute a ""dream list"" of outstanding judges who would uphold the original meaning of the Constitution and would not create new laws from the bench. Trump has said he would rely primarily on advice from the Federalist Society, the organization that promotes the ""original meaning"" view so strongly exemplified by Justice Scalia before his death.', 'If Trump would appoint a replacement for Scalia from his list of 11, and probably one or two other Supreme Court justices, then we could see a 5-4 or even 6-3 majority of conservative justices on the Supreme Court. The results for the nation would be overwhelmingly good.', 'Such a Supreme Court would finally return control of the nation to the people and their elected representatives, removing it from dictatorial judges who repeatedly make law from the bench.', 'Abortion', 'Such a court would likely overturn Roe v. Wade and return abortion laws and the regulation of abortion to the states.', 'Religious liberty', 'A conservative court would vigorously uphold the First Amendment, protecting freedom of religion and freedom of speech for Christian colleges, Christian ministries, and churches.', 'Such a court would likely overturn the horribly destructive decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) that changed the meaning of the First Amendment and ruled that a government action ""must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion"" (note: not a specific denomination but ""religion"" in general). A conservative court would likely declare that the First Amendment was only intended to prohibit the establishment of a state-sponsored church or denomination.', 'Such a decision would once again allow the nonsectarian affirmation of personal belief in God in public schools, would once again allow coaches to pray with their football teams before a game, and would allow visiting clergy to be invited to give a prayer at high school graduation ceremonies. It would also imply that nativity scenes without Santa Claus and Buddha should be allowed in government-owned parks and buildings at Christmas time. It wouldn’t require these things, but would allow them if local officials chose to approve them. It would restore true freedom of religion as the First Amendment intended.', 'It would also protect freedom of conscience for Christians who object to participating in abortions, or dispensing abortifacient medicines, or who do not wish to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies. It is also possible that a conservative Supreme Court would eventually return control of marriage to the states.', 'Freedom for Christian influence in politics', 'Significantly, Trump has pledged to work to repeal the 1954 Johnson Amendment to the IRS code, which has been used for 62 years as a threat to silence pastors from speaking about political issues, for fear of losing their tax-exempt status. This would be a great victory for freedom of religion and freedom of speech.', 'In short, a Trump-appointed Supreme Court, together with dozens of lower court judges appointed by him, would probably result in significant advances in many of the policy areas important to Christians. It would also open the door to huge expansion of influence for the many Christian lobbying groups known as ""family policy councils"" in various states, especially enabling them to work for further legal protections for life, for marriage and family, and for religious liberty.', 'How can we know that Trump won’t change his mind?', '""But Trump has changed his mind in the past,"" a politically-minded friend said to me. ""How do you know that he will do what he has promised? Maybe he’ll betray you and appoint a liberal Supreme Court justice.""', 'My reply is that we can never know the future conduct of any human being with 100% certainty, but in making an ethical decision like this one, we should base the decision on the most likely results. In this case, the most likely result is that Trump will do most or all of what he has said.', 'In the history of American politics, candidates who have been elected president have occasionally changed their minds on one or another issue while in office, but no president has ever gone back on most of what he has promised to do, especially on issues that are crucially important in the election. In this election, it is reasonable to think that the most likely result is that both Trump and Clinton will do what they have promised to do. That is the basis on which we should decide how to vote.', 'And notice how Trump has changed his mind. He continues to move in a more conservative direction, as evidenced by his list of judges and his choice for vice president. Just as he succeeded in business by listening to the best experts to solve each problem, I suspect that he has been learning from the best experts in conservative political thought and has increasingly found that conservative solutions really work. We should applaud these changes.', 'His choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate is an especially significant indication that he will govern as a conservative. Trump could have picked a moderate but instead picked a lifelong solid conservative who is a thoughtful, gracious policy wizard. Pence is a lawyer and former talk radio host who served 12 years in Congress and had significant congressional leadership positions, so he will be immensely helpful in working with Congress. He is a committed evangelical Christian. He is a former board member of the Indiana Family Institute, a conservative Christian lobbying group in Indiana.', 'However, the Supreme Court is not the only issue at stake in this election. While I disagree with Trump on a few things (especially trade policy), on most important issues, Trump will likely do much good for the nation.', 'Taxes and jobs', 'Trump has pledged to cut taxes significantly, while Clinton wants to raise them. Trump is advocating a 15% tax rate for corporations rather than the current 35%. Lower corporate taxes would lead to business expansion and a massive increase in available jobs and higher pay levels. For individual taxpayers, Trump favors a top rate of 25%, but for Clinton it’s 45%. Most small businesses file under this individual rate, so once again Trump’s lower taxes would result in substantial expansion of businesses and many more jobs. Finally our economy would snap out of its eight years of anemic growth.', 'In my judgment, Christians should support lower tax rates that would lead to more jobs, because Obama’s economic policies for the last eight years have hurt lower income and low-middle income families the most. Many can’t even find jobs, and others can’t find full-time jobs. Those who have jobs struggle to survive with no meaningful pay raises year after year. It is no surprise that these are the people who are supporting Trump in overwhelming numbers.', 'Tax rates are also a good indicator of government control. Higher tax rates mean greater government control of our lives, while lower tax rates indicate greater freedom.', 'Minorities', 'Two of the deepest causes of poverty among minority groups and racial tensions in our country are failing public schools in our inner cities and lack of available jobs. Trump expressed a commitment to solve these problems at several points in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention. He pledged to reduce taxes and regulations, leading to many more jobs. And he said:', '""Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are not employed . . . . This administration has failed America’s inner cities. It’s failed them on education. It’s failed and on jobs. It’s failed them on crime . . . . Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? . . . . We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.""', 'By contrast, Clinton will bow to the teachers’ unions and oppose school choice at every turn, and she will continue to strangle businesses with high taxes and regulations, preventing job growth.', 'The military', 'Trump has promised to rapidly rebuild our depleted military forces, but Clinton would continue the liberal policy of eviscerating them through denying funding. This is dangerous in light of increasing threats from China, Russia, Iran, and ISIS.', 'Borders', 'Trump has repeatedly promised that he will finally secure our borders, an urgent need to protect the nation from ever more terrorists and drug smugglers. Clinton will not do this but will continue to allow in what she thinks will be thousands of future Democratic voters.', 'ISIS and terrorism', 'Trump has pledged to aggressively attack and utterly defeat ISIS. Clinton will continue the anemic Obama policy of periodic bombing runs and drone attacks, under which ISIS has continued to thrive.', 'China and Russia', 'Trump will not let China and Russia and Iran push us around anymore, as Obama has done, with Hillary Clinton’s support when she was secretary of state. If Trump is anything, he is tough as nails, and he won’t be bullied.', 'Israel', 'Trump has promised to vigorously defend and support Israel, while Clinton will most likely continue the Obama administration’s criticism, snubbing, and marginalization of Israel.', 'Energy', 'Trump has said he will approve the Keystone oil pipeline and grant more oil drilling permits leading to lower energy costs and providing thousands of jobs. Lower energy costs help everybody, but the poor most of all. Clinton, by contrast, will make fracking nearly impossible and essentially abolish the coal industry, causing energy prices to skyrocket.', 'Executive orders and bathrooms', 'Trump has promised to rescind many of the most objectionable executive orders given by President Obama, so he will likely end the compulsory moral degradation forced on us by a liberal agenda, including orders forcing schools to allow boys in girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms, in defiance of the will of the vast majority of Americans. But Hillary Clinton would likely perpetuate and expand these policies.', 'Health care', 'Trump will work to repeal Obamacare, which is ruining the nation’s health care system, and replace it with an affordable free market system in which companies have the ability to sell insurance across state lines, thus substantially lowering insurance prices especially in those states that currently allow only high-priced ""Cadillac"" insurance plans. But Clinton would continue to work relentlessly toward federal government control of our entire health care industry.', 'The unprotected', 'Trump will finally begin to recognize and protect what Wall Street Journal writer Peggy Noonan calls ""the unprotected"" in America -- people in lower income areas who cannot find good jobs, cannot find good schools for their children, do not feel protected from crime, and find their retirement savings are not enough because for years they have been earning no interest in the bank. Trump said in his acceptance speech, ""Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across the nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned . . . I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.""', 'These American citizens recognize that Trump has built a business career on listening to experts, solving problems, and getting things done. They realize that Trump didn’t earn $4 billion by being stupid, and their instinct says that he might be exactly the right person to solve some of the biggest problems in a nation that has for too long been headed in the wrong direction and stuck in political gridlock.', 'They may not have college degrees but their old-fashioned common sense tells them that America would be a much better place if we no longer had to be afraid to say ""Merry Christmas,"" or that boys are different from girls, or that Islamic terrorists are Islamic terrorists. They’re sick and tired of being condescended to by the snobbish moralism of the liberal elites who dominate the power centers in our nation. That is why they cheer when Trump repeatedly violates the canons of politically correct speech. They have found in him someone who gives them hope, and they are supporting him by the thousands.', 'Does character matter?', '""But are you saying that character doesn’t matter?"" someone might ask. I believe that character does matter, but I think Trump’s character is far better than what is portrayed by much current political mud-slinging, and far better than his opponent’s character.', 'In addition, if someone makes doubts about character the only factor to consider, that is a fallacy in ethical reasoning that I call ""reductionism"" – the mistake of reducing every argument to only one factor, when the situation requires that multiple factors be considered. In this election, an even larger factor is the future of the nation that would flow from a Clinton or a Trump presidency.', 'To my friends who tell me they won’t vote for Trump because there is a chance he won’t govern at all like he promises, I reply that all of American presidential history shows that that result is unlikely, and it is ethically fallacious reasoning to base a decision on assuming a result that is unlikely to happen.', 'Consider instead the most likely results. The most likely result of voting for Trump is that he will govern the way he promises to do, bringing much good to the nation.', 'But the most likely result of not voting for Trump is that you will be abandoning thousands of unborn babies who will be put to death under Hillary Clinton’s Supreme Court, thousands of Christians who will be excluded from their lifelong occupations, thousands of the poor who will never again be able to find high-paying jobs in an economy crushed by government hostility toward business, thousands of inner-city children who will never be able to get a good education, thousands of the sick and elderly who will never get adequate medical treatment when the government is the nation’s only healthcare provider, thousands of people who will be killed by an unchecked ISIS, and millions of Jews in Israel who will find themselves alone and surrounded by hostile enemies. And you will be contributing to a permanent loss of the American system of government due to a final victory of unaccountable judicial tyranny.', 'When I look at it this way, my conscience, and my considered moral judgment tell me that I must vote for Donald Trump as the candidate who is most likely to do the most good for the United States of America.']",Why Voting for Donald Trump Is a Morally Good Choice,"Some of my Christian friends tell me they cant in good conscience vote for Donald Trump because, when faced with a choice between the lesser of two evils, the morally right thing is to choose neither one. They recommend voting for a third-party or write-in candidate..07/29/2016 15:53:09PM EST.","Why Voting for Donald Trump Is a Morally Good Choice, Wayne Grudem, Conservative News, Conservative opinion,

This was not bedroom playacting between lovers; Bensley claimed to be a centuries-old vampire who needed blood to stay alive. The woman escaped and called police, and Lyle the would-be vampire was arrested for assault."", 'But is it safe to drink blood?', 'In very small amounts (say, a few teaspoons), and if the blood is free from pathogens (such as the many blood-borne diseases), blood might not harm you. Beyond that, watch out. [Circulatory System: Facts, Function & Diseases]', ""The strange fact is, blood, when drank, is toxic. When confined to places where blood is supposed to be — such as the heart, vessels, and so on — it is essential for life. But when ingested it's a very different story. Of course all toxins have doses, and just as a tiny bit of poison won't necessarily harm you, the more you eat or drink, the greater the danger. [7 Strange Ways that People Act Like Vampires]"", 'Because blood is so rich in iron — and because the body has difficulty excreting excess iron — any animal that consumes blood regularly runs a risk of iron overdose. While iron is necessary for all animals (and indeed most life), in high doses it can be toxic. This condition, called haemochromatosis, can cause a wide variety of diseases and problems, including liver damage, buildup of fluid in the lungs, dehydration, low blood pressure, and nervous disorders.', 'Even so, blood-feeding in humans seems to be more common than one might expect. John Edgar Browning of Georgia Tech, who has researched the practice, suggests in a BBC article that thousands of people across the United States drink blood for various reasons. Some of these people say the oxygen- and iron-enriched substance gives them energy, and none of the drinkers interviewed by Browning have had any ill effects from their behavior, so perhaps they didn\'t overdo the blood meals: ""No vampire I’ve interviewed has complained of any medical complications as a result of consuming blood,"" Browning said, according to BBC.', 'Unlike humans, the bodies of animals that digest blood have adapted specialized digestive mechanisms. According to Katherine Ramsland in her book ""The Science of Vampires"" (Penguin Putnam, 2002) the vampire bat, ""requires an enormous intake of iron, which helps make hemoglobin for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Yet the iron intake is generally higher than what the bat needs, so it has a special process for secreting the excess. When ingested, the blood goes through a tract that\'s adapted for extracting nutrients.

It’s hard to keep the romance alive if you’re feeling stressed out about money and you’re afraid of talking to your partner about something that affects the both of you so closely.', 'The fact that millennials are good at this feels weirdly like a no-brainer. Though other generations will often disparage millennials for being too sensitive and open about their feelings, it seems like the benefit of this is millennials are more likely to be transparent and not shy away from tough relationship conversations.', 'The survey included 1,902 adults, and included couples of all ages to see how different age groups talked about their money matters. Most of the couples classified themselves as ""married"" or ""committed.""

I was rearranging the bedclothes over my new knee when I realized the down comforter felt like lead, and lifting it felt like doing a bench press.', 'That seemed curious, but I was so bent on getting the new knee to work properly that I ignored my sore arms as well as a stubborn stiffness in my neck and hips. Physical therapy was my focus, and the goal was to get back to my favorite pastime — rowing. It had kept me in shape for years, and I was missing early mornings on the Potomac.', 'Months later, I still hadn’t picked up an oar. Instead, I’d endured anemia, weight loss, fevers, stiffness and sometimes excruciating pain in my hips and legs. I felt as if I’d been hit by the flu, or maybe a truck. Getting out of bed was painful, and getting into a boat again seemed an impossible task.', 'The culprit: polymyalgia rheumatica, or PMR, an autoimmune disease that spreads painful inflammation through most of the body’s joints.', 'Never heard of it? Neither had I. Yet it strikes many older Americans, usually in their 70s and 80s, more women than men. The afflicted are more often of Northern European extraction, indicating to researchers that genetics may be at work.', 'Fortunately, PMR responds quickly to the steroid drug prednisone. The important thing is to recognize, not ignore, the symptoms and seek help. I felt better within a day of finally seeing my doctor, being diagnosed and taking my first dose of prednisone. In most cases, the condition can be cured, although slowly over months, sometimes years. And in some situations it can be complicated by a more serious disease.', 'Why and how PMR strikes is mysterious, although researchers are looking at viruses or stress as triggers for the disease. But undeniably, it is associated with aging, and particularly the aging immune system.', 'With the first wave of baby boomers heading into their 70s this year, America’s elderly population will swell, and doctors think there will almost certainly be more cases of PMR.', 'Basically, polymyalgia rheumatica tricks the immune system into attacking its own body — sending antibodies and immune cells into the hundreds of fluid-filled sacs called bursae that lie throughout our joints and surrounding soft tissue. In the healthy body, those sacs — some no wider than a dime, others the size of a silver dollar — keep our joints moving smoothly. But when inflamed by PMR, they cause pain and stiffness. PMR also impedes the bone marrow’s ability to make red blood cells, causing anemia.', 'Such an inflammatory response is like a complex cascade, according to Marcy O’Koon Moss, director of consumer health for the Arthritis Foundation, which counts PMR among more than 100 diseases it focuses on.', '""It’s not one thing that happens. The cells involved signal each other and communicate,"" she said.', 'Many people stricken with PMR confuse their symptoms with aging and just soldier on. But as the disease progresses and becomes more debilitating, most figure that something beyond old age is at work.', 'Phil Ringo, 74, of Haverford, Pa., couldn’t imagine what was wrong four years ago when he began feeling sore and ill.', '""I thought I’d gone from a pretty vigorous 70-year-old to an old, old man,"" he said. ""Grandchildren were saying, ‘What’s wrong with Papa?’ ""', 'Unable to get out of a chair or into a cab without a struggle, he got no answers from his doctors. And when he tried for an appointment with one of the nation’s top diagnostic clinics, ""they basically said, ‘You’re an old guy.’ "" Ringo said. "" ‘ Just get used to it.’ "" He was finally diagnosed and treated after a friend with the disease convinced him to see a rheumatologist.', 'Actually PMR is famously tricky to diagnose.', '""A definitive test does not exist for PMR,"" said rheumatologist Rebecca Manno, a Johns Hopkins School of Medicine faculty member and researcher. ""And there are other conditions that mimic PMR,"" such as rheumatoid arthritis, various infections and even some forms of cancer.', 'So the diagnostic process can be torturous. Leslie Kermath, 70, of Whitefish, Mont., spent almost a month undergoing tests before her doctor felt confident that PMR was causing her pain, stiffness and fever.', 'Along the way, she got antibiotics for an existing urinary tract infection, was sent to the hospital for a chest X-ray and a CAT scan after a test flagged a possible blood clot. Later she had another CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis, because her hips were terribly painful. A Lyme disease test came back negative.', 'Eventually, her blood tests, which showed increasing levels of inflammation, plus her symptoms and age, nailed the diagnosis for Kermath’s doctor, who started her on prednisone.', '""How many women of Caucasian origin, who are older, think they’re just aging and can’t do everything they used to — when they actually have this disease?"" said Kermath, who is an avid hiker.', 'Most doctors suspecting PMR order several blood tests, almost always two that look for inflammation: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, known as the ESR test, and another for CRP, or C-reactive protein. Doctors also check for antibodies associated with rheumatoid arthritis, to rule out that disease.', 'When I finally dragged myself to my internist three months after my symptoms showed up, she immediately suspected PMR. Given my age — 73 — my symptoms and lab results showing considerable inflammation and anemia, she started me on prednisone and sent me to a rheumatologist. After eight weeks of prednisone, my inflammation numbers had fallen to near normal and my anemia was under control.', 'My rheumatologist has reduced my steroid dose, but only very gradually because rebounds do happen. The hope is that I can be steroid-free — a sign of a cure — sometime in 2017.', '""Treating PMR is one of the more gratifying parts of my practice,"" said my doctor, Joseph P. Laukaitis. ""In my experience, about 95 percent of patients fully recover.""', 'For a PMR patient, prednisone feels like a miracle drug because it so quickly attacks inflammation and banishes the pain and stiffness. But in fact, prednisone is ""wonderful, wicked"" in Manno’s words. The side effects that some people experience are considerable: a thinning of the bones (already a problem for many older women), high blood pressure, weight gain, high blood sugar, insomnia and a distinctive addition of facial fat known as ""moon face.""', 'Most patients who take prednisone for PMR will also be prescribed a drug to slow bone loss, and that medication, too, has side effects.', 'Although diagnosing PMR can be difficult, doing so is crucial because a much more serious disease, giant cell arteritis, strikes about 10 to 20 percent of people with PMR. Giant cell arteritis causes inflammation and damage to blood vessels in the head and elsewhere. Untreated, it can cause blindness, stroke, even death. PMR patients can expect their doctors to look for symptoms of GCA: severe headaches, tender scalp, jaw pain and blurred vision.', 'Any one of those can indicate that the arteries of the head are inflamed. The diagnosis often requires a biopsy of one of the arteries in the scalp to confirm inflammation. Again, prednisone is the treatment.', 'Much of today’s research into PMR and GCA looks for alternatives to prednisone.', 'Biologics — drugs made from living organisms — hold promise because some can ""inhibit an inflammatory response as it picks up steam,"" the Arthritis Foundation’s O’Koon Moss said. ""It’s like interrupting a chain reaction.""', '""There are also promising clinical trials of drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and have FDA approval for that. And they may be effective for PMR,"" Manno said.', 'Until other drugs become available, prednisone will remain the preferred treatment despite all its of downsides.', 'As I face months of treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica, taking smaller and smaller doses of prednisone each month, I hope to avoid remission and eventually regain my strength. Exercise is key, as it so often is when ill health strikes, so you’ll find me on the stationary bike or walking or, if not rowing, at least beginning to build up stamina on the indoor rowing machine.', 'The rowing season of 2016 may have eluded me, but the 2017 season is only months away.']",I’d never heard of this condition until the terrible joint pain set in,"Don’t delay going to the doctor, because treatment can make you feel better fast.","joint pain, pmr, polymyalgia rheumatica, prednisone, aging joints, pain management, cortisone shot, immune system",,,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': None, 'spoilerPublisher': None}",['polymyalgia rheumatica'],"[[[3, 13], [3, 35]]]",['phrase']

This had to be the year.', 'It was.', 'On Wednesday night the Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians, 8-7, in a Game 7 for the ages. With that victory — yes, the following words are really true — the Chicago Cubs won the World Series.', 'But it just couldn’t come easy, couldn’t be won without extra drama. The Cubs carried a 6-3 lead into the eighth inning, six outs away from a cathartic victory. But a double and a two-run home run by the Indians wiped out that lead and tied the game, and the deadlock held through the ninth inning.', 'Then the rain came. Of course. The top of the 10th inning was delayed for about 15 minutes by a deluge. But once it let up, the Cubs poured it on in the 10th inning, scoring 2 runs to provide the cushion they needed. World Series M.V.P. Ben Zobrist hit a go-ahead double, and Miguel Montero followed up with an R.B.I. single to give the Cubs the insurance run they needed.', 'It is their third title in the World Series, a competition that was introduced in 1903, but this may be the sweetest and hardest-earned championship in the history of American sports. Making it even more sweet was that the Cubs trailed in the series by three games to one.', 'Upon the final out the players jumped and celebrated on the diamond while thousands of visiting Cubs fans screamed joyfully in the stands. Back in Chicago, where fans in the North Side of Chicago have waited generations for this day, revelers poured into the streets for party that will probably last days.', 'In Cleveland, a city with its own hard-luck sports history, the wait continues. The Indians have not won the World Series since 1948, and they now own the longest drought in baseball without a title. At least the Cleveland Cavaliers, many of whom were in attendance Wednesday at Progressive Field, broke Cleveland’s 52-year span without a major professional sports title by winning the N.B.A. championship in June.', 'For the Cubs, whose long history is riddled with the mythology of billy goat curses, black cats and a fan who was vilified for interfering with a foul ball, theirs is now a history of winning, and their identity changes forever.', 'Theo Epstein knows all about that. He is the Cubs’ top baseball decision-maker, the man who put together a team and an ethos capable of dashing history’s long reach.', 'Prior to joining the Cubs, Epstein was the general manager of the Boston Red Sox in 2004, when that once-accursed franchise won its first World Series in 86 years. Red Sox and Cubs fans were the longest suffering at the time, and Epstein has given closure to both.', 'Here’s an inning-by-inning breakdown of how the Cubs won Game 7:', 'Top of 1st: Fowler Crushes One', 'Corey Kluber is trying to become the first pitcher to win three starts in a single World Series since 1968, but he got off to a terrible start when Dexter Fowler launched the fourth pitch of the game over the center field wall, giving the Cubs a 1-0 lead and quieting the Indians fans at Cleveland’s Progressive Field. It was the first leadoff home run ever in Game 7 of a World Series.', 'After Fowler’s blast, Kyle Schwarber hit a slow grounder to the right side of the infield. The Indians had the shift on, and Francisco Lindor, the shortstop, was able to field the ball, but Schwarber, running on a reconstructed knee, was able to beat the throw for an infield single.', 'Kris Bryant flied out to right for the first out of the game, and Anthony Rizzo followed him by flying out to center. Schwarber, who has three career stolen bases, surprised the Indians (and just about anyone watching) by stealing second with Ben Zobrist at the plate, but Kluber was able to get Zobrist to pop out to end the inning.', 'Kluber escaped having allowed just one run and kept his pitch count to 19, but it was hardly the start he was looking for.', 'David Waldstein: When Fowler hit that home run, I almost thought for a moment that Rajai Davis caught the ball on his jump because it seemed like the entire stadium erupted. But it was Cubs fans celebrating the home run. I have never seen this many visiting fans invade a baseball stadium for such a big game. Yes, you will see a lot of Yankees fans in Tampa in May, but this is Game 7 of the World Series. If it is not 50-50 between Cubs and Indians fans, then it is 40-60. In the section of the bleachers closest to center field, it appeared to be 80 percent Cubs fans.', 'Bottom of 1st: Indians Can’t Match Cubs’ Start', 'The Indians were not able to match the Cubs’ strong start to the game.', 'Leadoff man Carlos Santana crushed a liner to right on Kyle Hendricks’s first pitch, but it was right at Jason Heyward, who easily caught the ball for the first out. Jason Kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three. Francisco Lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out, but Javier Baez slipped when trying to throw from his knees, which allowed Lindor to reach safely. Hendricks was able to work around the error by inducing a broken-bat grounder to shortstop from Mike Napoli to end the inning.', 'Victor Mather: Hendricks last pitched in Game 3, when he threw 4 1/3 somewhat shaky innings, giving up six hits and two walks. But crucially, like the first inning tonight, he gave up no runs.', 'David Waldstein: Terry Francona was on a pregame humor jag, making jokes about how he had a dream after Game 6 that someone was breaking his ribs. He woke up to discover he had been sleeping on the TV remote and it was stuck in his ribcage. He also admitted he was dipping pretzels in peanut butter in bed and when he woke up there was peanut butter on his glasses. ""My bedroom looked like a national disaster last night,"" he said. Too much info?', 'Top of 2nd: Kluber Settles In', 'Kluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitches. Addison Russell was the offensive star of Game 6 with a two-run double and a grand slam, but Corey Kluber was able to retire him in his first at-bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop. Willson Contreras then hit a pitch into right-field foul territory that Lonnie Chisenhall tracked down with little effort. Jason Heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop.', 'David Waldstein: Kluber settles down to retire the last six batters, all on fly balls. Kluber is 12-1 in his last 14 starts at Progressive Field with a 1.87 earned run average, including postseason games. But this is the only time he has started three times in nine days. Now it’s up the the Indians hitters to get him back even.', 'Bottom of 2nd: Hendricks Helps Himself', 'The Indians had runners reach base twice in the half-inning but got nothing to show for it.', 'Jose Ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of Kyle Hendricks before rolling toward shortstop. With the ball coming at him fairly slowly, Addison Russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball as Ramirez reached first. The play was ruled a single rather than an error, as Russell likely did not have a play. Ramirez, however, underestimated Hendricks’ ability to hold on runners and got picked off of first.', 'Lonnie Chisenhall singled, but Rajai Davis grounded into a 5-4-3 double play that was truly impressive considering Davis’s speed.', 'David Waldstein: Great play by the icy-veined Kyle Hendricks to pick off Jose Ramirez off first. But everyone knows Hendricks has a terrific pickoff move, so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught. That really messed up the inning because Chisenhall’s single would have put two runners on base with nobody out.', 'The Indians were very sloppy in Game 6 and cannot afford to do that again, especially with the Cubs’ batters getting warmed up in this weather.', 'Top of 3rd: Schwarber Runs Cubs Out of Inning', 'Javier Baez put a big swing on a 1-1 curveball but just missed as he flied out to left for the first out of the inning. Dexter Fowler, he of the leadoff home run, then jumped on the first pitch he saw from Corey Kluber in his second at-bat, but lined out to right. With two outs, Kyle Schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield. But Schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and was thrown out easily at second base by Lonnie Chisenhall to end the inning.', 'Victor Mather: Maybe you aren’t a baseball fan. Well, Akron and Toledo are involved in some exciting college football MACtion on ESPN2. As you might expect, with an Indians World Series on the line, the crowd is sparse in Akron.', 'David Waldstein: Lonnie Chisenhall has had an adventurous World Series, but he has a great arm and Schwarber never should have challenged it, especially with a surgically repaired knee. The shenanigans in the outfield in Game 6 were mostly miscommunication and the fault of the center fielder, Tyler Naquin, and that is why he is on the bench.', 'Bottom of 3rd: Indians Get Aggressive', 'The Indians tied the game thanks to a leadoff double, a well-placed bunt, and a run-scoring single. It looked like it could get far worse for the Cubs, but Kyle Hendricks once again worked his way around a few baserunners.', 'Coco Crisp got things started by showing some serious aggressiveness, lacing a ball into the left field corner and legging out a leadoff double. Hoping to take advantage of the baserunner by playing some small ball, the Indians had Roberto Perez bunt Crisp over to third. Carlos Santana then crushed a 1-0 curveball to right for a single, bringing Crisp home and tying the game.', 'With one run in, Jason Kipnis hit what looked like a double-play ball to shortstop. Addison Russell flipped to Javier Baez who dropped the ball, and all runners were ruled safe after a review of the play.', 'The defensive miscue set Cleveland up with runners on first and second with one out. But Francisco Lindor flied out to left and Mike Napoli lined out to third to end the threat.', 'Victor Mather: It’s been a tough Series for Napoli, who was 4-for-19 without an extra-base hit coming into this game, is 0 for 2 tonight and just missed his chance with men on first and second and two outs. It was a great advertisement for replay when the terrible out call on Santana at second was overturned. Baez never had it.', 'David Waldstein: The Indians are squaring up on Hendricks, so Cubs Manager Joe Maddon instructed Jon Lester to start warming up.', 'It was so important for the Indians to get back even, which is why they played for the one run. Some may have wanted the Indians to play for the big inning since they seemed to be on Hendricks, but Francona elected to draw even. Roberto Perez did a terrific job of executing the bunt with Rizzo only about 20 feet away from him. The Cubs, particularly Baez, are looking shaky.', 'Top of 4th: Cubs Back on Top', 'A shallow pop-fly to center and some aggressive baserunning by Kris Bryant put the Cubs back in the lead. Willson Contreras tacked on an R.B.I. double and with a 3-1 lead, Chicago had some breathing room for the first time this game.', 'Bryant led off the inning by working a full-count against Corey Kluber, and on the eighth pitch of the at-bat he singled on a hard grounder to left. Anthony Rizzo was hit in the right shoulder by a pitch, bringing up Ben Zobrist with two runners on and no outs. He hit a grounder to first that Mike Napoli fielded and threw to Francisco Lindor who was covering second. Rizzo slid in under Lindor’s feet, but was ruled out even though Lindor’s foot may not have been on the bag.', 'That brought up Addison Russell with runners at the corners and he hit a shallow pop-up to center. Bryant, knowing that Rajai Davis does not have a strong throwing arm, broke for home as Davis caught the ball and he slid in just ahead of the tag from Roberto Perez.', 'Kluber looked like he had Contreras on the ropes with two outs, but the young catcher launched a 2-2 curveball into deep center that got over Davis’s head. Zobrist scored and Contreras got into second base easily. Kluber ended the bleeding by retiring Jason Heyward on a pop-out to shortstop.', 'David Waldstein: Now the Indians are making the miscues. The Cubs scored twice, but it could have been and maybe should have been zero. The Believelanders are feeling like Bereavelanders.', 'Victor Mather: Wilson Contreras, 1-for-17 coming into tonight, has probably been the Cubs’ worst Series performer. But he comes through to give the Cubs the 3-1 lead. His rookie season was a key part of the Cubs’ fine year; now he adds a big World Series R.B.I.', 'Bottom of 4th: Hendricks Works Well With a Lead', 'Kyle Hendricks undoubtedly has an incredibly short leash from Joe Maddon, but he started things off well in the half-inning by retiring Jose Ramirez on a soft grounder to first base. He retired Lonnie Chisenhall on a soft fly to left for the second out, and got Rajai Davis to fly to right to end the inning. Hendricks has thrown just 50 pitches, but it would be surprising if he stayed in the game beyond the fifth inning.', 'David Waldstein: That was a great inning by Hendricks. One of the most important things in pitching is the shutdown inning after your team scores. Hendricks had his cleanest frame of the game and that was vital in terms of solidifying the lead and demoralizing the Indians. The tension and the excitement that was felt in this stadium just an inning ago has changed perceptibly. Now it feels just a tiny bit more like a sense of inevitability. The Cubs seem to be rolling ever since Game 5. Still a ways to go, though. The meat of the Indians’ order comes up at least two more times.', 'Top of 5th: Baez Ends Kluber’s Night', 'The Cubs extended their lead to four the hard way, by getting one apiece off of Corey Kluber and Andrew Miller.', 'Javier Baez took a hard cut at Kluber’s first pitch of the inning and crushed a home run, ending the ace’s night. Terry Francona immediately headed to the mound to replace him with Miller and start what could be a long night for the Indians’ bullpen.', 'Dexter Fowler was the first batter to face Miller and was not intimidated by the reliever, stroking a 1-2 slider into left for a single. But Kyle Schwarber gave Miller some help by grounding into a 6-4-3 double-play.', 'Kris Bryant came up with two outs and worked a full-count off of Miller. He somehow ended up drawing a walk on the ninth pitch of the at-bat, after seeing Miller’s ""unhittable"" slider on six consecutive pitches, and then was running on the pitch when Anthony Rizzo sliced a single to right. Bryant, running hard the entire way, was able to score and Rizzo reached second after the throw.', 'It looked like Chicago could do even more damage when Ben Zobrist hit a ball to deep center field, but Rajai Davis caught it on the warning track to end the inning. Miller, who the Indians would like to soak up at least a few innings, has already thrown 20 pitches.', 'David Waldstein: The Cubs are really swinging well now in the warm weather, much like they did in the regular season when they scored 808 runs, the most by a National League team at sea level (Red Sox had 878 runs, the Rockies 845). Perhaps it was only a matter of time, perhaps it was fatigue among the Indians’ pitchers, perhaps it was the addition of Schwarber lengthening the lineup. Even Baez, who was 4 for 26 with 4 singles (and 2 errors in Game 7) hit a home run off the previously impenetrable Kluber. They are even hitting Andrew Miller hard.', 'Victor Mather: If this were the last time the Cubs won the World Series, the game would be over. The decisive Game 5 of that Series, in 1908, lasted 1 hour, 25 minutes. No game in the series lasted more than 2:10.', 'Bottom of 5th: Lester and Ross Open Door for Indians', 'The move to bring in Jon Lester as a reliever had major implications for the Cubs, mostly because of the corresponding move to put in his personal catcher, David Ross. Because of two miscues by Ross, the Indians scored two runs, cutting Chicago’s lead in half.', 'Kyle Hendricks was allowed to come out to start the inning even though Jon Lester was ready in Chicago’s bullpen. He got a soft grounder to second from Coco Crisp for the first out, and struck out Roberto Perez for out two. But Hendricks walked Carlos Santana and his day was done, with Lester being summoned to face Jason Kipnis.', 'Kipnis hit a soft grounder that was fielded by Ross, but the veteran who had just entered the game, threw the ball well out of Anthony Rizzo’s reach, which resulted in Francisco Lindor coming up with runners on second and third with two outs. Lester threw a ball in the dirt that caromed off of Ross’s mask and as the catcher tried to go after it, he stumbled, taking so long to recover the ball that both runners scored.', 'Lester was able to strike out Lindor to end the inning, but the game certainly got more interesting.', 'Because Hendricks did not pitch five innings, he is not in line for the victory should the Cubs hold on.', 'David Waldstein: Lester (and to a lesser degree, Ross) coming into the game was supposed to be the Cubs’ Madison Bumgarner moment, but it looked more like an old-fashioned Cubs moment. Terrific, aggressive base running by Jason Kipnis to score from second base on a wild pitch. He never hesitated and made a beautiful slide under the tag, then got up and punched the air. Terrible inning by Ross, who made the error to allow Kipnis to get all the way to second, and then was staggered by the ball when the wild pitch hit him in the mask. It feels like a game again.', 'Top of 6th: Ross Makes Up for Mistakes', 'David Ross helped erase some of the damage his defense had done in the previous inning by launching a one-out home run to center field that pushed Chicago’s lead back to 6-3. Jason Heyward was the second out of the inning when he grounded out to first, and Javier Baez struck out to end the inning.', 'Andrew Miller, who looked unhittable earlier in the playoffs, has now allowed two earned runs and gotten just four outs.', 'David Waldstein: I promise, were not making all this up. David Ross, who is playing in his last professional baseball game at age 39, who has played on 21 different professional teams at all levels, who is the elder statesman of the Cubs, just hit his first World Series home run. It came after a wild inning behind the plate where he made one error, then got punched in the mask by a bouncing wild pitch that allowed two runs to score. Is it meant to be?', 'Bottom of 6th: Indians Come Up Short', 'Mike Napoli continued his struggles by striking out to lead off the half-inning. That brought up Jose Ramirez, and the third baseman grounded out to shortstop, nearly beating Addison Russell’s throw to first base that Anthony Rizzo made a great stretch on. Brandon Guyer came in as a pinch-hitter for Lonnie Chisenhall and he hit a two-out single to left, but Rajai Davis grounded out to strand him at first.', 'Victor Mather: Oct. 14, 1908. Bennett Park, Detroit. Orval Overall outdueled Wild Bill Donovan, and the Cubs won the World Series. They are nine outs away from doing it again.', 'Top of 7th: Cubs Chase Miller, but Fail to Score', 'Dexter Fowler improved to 3 for 4 by singling to start the inning. That brought Kyle Schwarber to the plate in a tough lefty-on-lefty matchup against Andrew Miller and the ace reliever won the battle, getting Schwarber to fly out to left.', 'But with that that, Miller’s day was over, with Terry Francona replacing him with the team’s closer, Cody Allen. Allen was able to strand the runner he inherited from Miller by striking out Kris Bryant, as Fowler was caught stealing after the pitch for a double play.', 'While Miller is not on the hook for a loss, the game was well below his standards. He threw 43 pitches in two and one-third innings, allowing four hits and two earned runs.', 'Bottom of 7th: Lester Gets Job Done', 'Coco Crisp flied out to left to start the inning and then Jon Lester ran the count full against Roberto Perez before walking the catcher on the seventh pitch of the at-bat. Tyler Naquin came in as a pinch-runner for Perez before Carlos Santana hit a come-backer to Lester. The yips that have been a topic of conversation throughout the playoffs were in play as Lester barely looked at second before throwing underhand to first to get one out on a play that would have gotten two with almost any other pitcher on the mound. Lester did not end up paying for it as he struck out Jason Kipnis to end the inning.', 'Top of 8th: Allen Shuts Down Cubs', 'A dropped strike three forced a throw to first base, but Anthony Rizzo was easily retired to start the inning. Then Ben Zobrist looked completely overwhelmed by Cody Allen’s stuff before eventually grounding out to first. Addison Russell watched strikes one and two sail right past him before popping out to first base to end the inning. Allen has need just 17 pitches to record five outs.', 'Bottom of 8th: Tie Game!', 'A day after he was controversially brought into a blowout rather than being preserved for a Game 7 appearance, Aroldis Chapman proved to be human by giving up Chicago’s three-run lead in just two batters.', 'Jon Lester had gotten the first two outs of the inning but was pulled from the game after Jose Ramirez hit a ball up the middle that Addison Russell couldn’t quite handle.', 'Brought in for a four-out save, Chapman fired seven consecutive fastballs to Brandon Guyer, topping out at 100.3 miles per hour, but it was the last one that cost him as Guyer drove the ball to left–center for a double, bringing in a run. Chapman then imploded, allowing a two-run home run to Rajai Davis that tied the game and blew the save attempt. Coco Crisp piled on with a single but Yan Gomes, who had entered the game in the eighth inning, struck out to end the inning.', 'Chapman ended up throwing 21 pitches and looked like he was completely out of gas despite the radar gun indicating he still had his velocity.', 'Top of 9th: Cubs’ Squeeze Doesn’t Work', 'With new life breathed into the Cleveland Indians, and rain starting to fall, Cody Allen walked the leadoff batter, David Ross, on five pitches. The Cubs looked to capitalize by bringing in Chris Coghlan as a pinch-runner for Ross, but he was erased on a force-out when Jason Heyward grounded to second base. Heyward then got something started by stealing his third base of the series, and advanced to third on a bad throw from Yan Gomes.', 'Michael Martinez was brought in as a defensive replacement in right field to help prevent a sacrifice fly from scoring a run, but Shaw took care of Javier Baez by striking him out on an awkward two-strike bunt attempt. That brought up Dexter Fowler, who had been one of the Cubs’ better hitters all game, and he laced a ball up the middle that looked like it would get through before Francisco Lindor chased it down behind second base and threw Fowler out at first.', 'The Indians now have a chance to win the game and the series at home in the bottom of the ninth.', 'Bottom of 9th: Chapman Shuts Down Indians in 9th', 'This game is headed to extra innings.', 'Aroldis Chapman was back out to start the bottom of the ninth despite having looked completely worn out in the eighth. He got Carlos Santana to fly out before ending up in a long battle with Jason Kipnis. He fired Kipnis a steady diet of sliders rather than his signature heater and ended up in a full-count before slamming the door with a 97.4-mph fastball. Francisco Lindor flied out to right, ending the inning.', 'Victor Mather: Extra-innings Game 7’s: 1924 Senators-Giants, 1991 Twins-Braves, 1997 Marlins- Indians. And tonight.', 'Top of 10th: Rain Delay, Then Cubs Pounce', 'The Cubs are back in the lead thanks to Ben Zobrist, Miguel Montero, and a couple questional intentional walks.', 'After a brief rain delay, the game resumed with Kyle Schwarber facing off against Bryan Shaw. The Cubs’ designated hitter once again attacked the shift, hitting a grounder through the right side of the infield for his third hit of the game.', 'Albert Almora came in as a pinch-runner for Schwarber and the move paid off when Kris Bryant hit a deep flyout to center and Almora showed off some tremendous baserunning ability by tagging up and advancing to second.', 'With first base empty, Shaw intentionally walked Anthony Rizzo to get to Zobrist. The versatile veteran who won a World Series with Kansas City last year made him pay for it by driving in Almora with a double down the third-base line that energized the Cubs.', 'Shaw then issued another intentional walk, this one to Addison Russell, and with the bases loaded, Miguel Montero laced a single into left that drove in Chicago’s eighth run of the game.', 'Cleveland brought in Trevor Bauer with the bases loaded and one out, and the losing pitcher in Games 2 and 5 took care of business, striking out Jason Heyward and getting Javier Baez to fly out to center field to limit the damage.The Indians now have three outs to get back into the game.', 'Bottom of 10th: Indians Get a Run, but Needed Two', 'With one out left in the game, the Indians closed their deficit to one run but that was as close as they would get as the Cubs ended a World Series drought that had been going since 1908.', 'The ending was complicated because Aroldis Chapman was out of the game after throwing 35 pitches in one and one-third innings. With their closer gone, the Cubs called on Carl Edwards Jr., a 25-year-old right-hander with 41 career regular season appearances and two career saves, to close things out. The 2011 48th-round draft pick started things off by striking out Mike Napoli swinging on a 95-mph fastball. He got Jose Ramirez to ground out to shortstop for the second out. That brought up Brandon Guyer, and Edwards walked him on five pitches.', 'With Rajai Davis, who had tied the game in the eighth inning with a two-run homer, due up, Cubs pitching coach Chris Bosio visited the mound. Chicago allowed Guyer to advance to second base without a throw and Davis delivered again with a single that drove Guyer in and closed the gap to one run.', 'Joe Maddon was not taking any chances and he pulled the plug on his young pitcher, pulling him for Michael Montgomery with Michael Martinez due up. The left-hander took care of business, retiring Martinez on a soft groundball and earning himself a save.']",World Series: Here’s How the Chicago Cubs Won Game 7,"It’s true.

Yes, there’s the augmented reality mode, and you can leave that AR feature on to put Pokémon on a backdrop of whatever’s in front of you. Problem is, you’re then focusing on catching the Pokémon instead of the background of reality.', 'The little suckers move around in AR mode, too! It’s one thing to walk around your apartment trying to catch a particularly jump-happy Pokémon. It’s much worse to do so while also trying to drive. You can’t easily spin around in the driver’s seat if a Pokémon darts sideways, and it takes an absurd amount of your attention to follow them around anyway.', 'So, keep it in park if you’re going to do anything in the game.

Then drive there! Driving is great. When you park, do so in a safe and legal location.

This will drain your battery life fast, according to anyone who’s ever played the game for more than 30 minutes.', 'Fortunately, most cars now come with power outlets, so your car is bizarrely well-suited for hunting Pokémon.

That’s only about 12 mph for those of us not fully dedicated to the metric system. 12! You would blow the fuse in your horn if you got stuck behind some jamoke doing 12 mph on a public road.', 'It’s still worth having the app on and hidden in your car as it will still log that brief bit of travel under 12 mph, but don’t expect it to hatch eggs much faster.

Armed with this information, scientists had for many years searched for the source of blue eyes on the OCA2 gene, but without success.', 'More recently, a mutation to a separate, nearby gene called HERC2 has been identified as the cause of blue eyes. This alteration switches off OCA2, the gene that determines the amount of the brown pigment melanin that we make. It is thought to have first occurred when humans began to migrate from Africa to Europe, meaning that every person with blue eyes is a descendent of a single early European.', 'The fact that every blue-eyed person alive today has this same mutation is pretty compelling evidence for this theory, although the identity of the initial mutant remains something of a mystery. To date, the earliest set of sapphire-colored peepers ever found belong to a 7,000-year-old skeleton that was discovered in northern Spain. Naturally, the eyes had long since decayed, however genetic analysis revealed that they would have appeared blue in color.']",All Blue-Eyed People Have This One Thing In Common,"Every blue-eyed person on the planet is descended from a single European who lived around 6,000 to 10,000 years ago, and who first developed a specific mut",,"['http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/icon-environment.png?v=1.2.0', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/ilss-logo.png?v=1.2.0', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/images/14eb813a-5314-5cd3-b022-00d93b599aba/default-1464383304-257-all-blue-eyed-people-have-this-one-thing-in-common.jpg', 'http://iflscience-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538316330&cs=c58cc2de06&cb=1487690647', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/iflscience_logo_narrow.png?v=1.2.0', 'http://iflscience-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538318083&cs=075600f372&cb=1487690647', 'http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=18981470&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/iflscience_logo.png?v=1.2.0', 'http://iflscience-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538318082&cs=f932d0946b&cb=1487690647', 'http://iflscience-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538316414&cs=6c4ace3c1f&cb=1487690647', 'http://iflscience-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538316406&cs=69f403dc56&cb=1487690647', 'http://iflscience-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538316385&cs=24a66e6205&cb=1487690647', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/icon-space.png?v=1.2.0', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/ifls-placeholder.png?v=1.2.0', 'http://iflscience-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538316354&cs=07106bb0fd&cb=1487690647', 'http://iflscience-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538318062&cs=23fc1c635f&cb=1487690647', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/icon-technology.png?v=1.2.0', 'http://iflscience-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538316331&cs=ff36d3abd8&cb=1487690647', 'http://iflscience-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538318062&cs=d6f5031c43&cb=1487690647', 'http://iflscience-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538318081&cs=87fb1c7e69&cb=1487690647', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/icon-plants-and-animals.png?v=1.2.0', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/icon-editors-blog.png?v=1.2.0', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/images/19d83c49-0204-5ea9-ae40-aeedf26a99b4/author_large-1465220073-ben-taub.jpg', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/icon-the-brain.png?v=1.2.0', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/icon-chemistry.png?v=1.2.0', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/icon-health-and-medicine.png?v=1.2.0', 'http://cdn.iflscience.com/assets/site/img/icon-physics.png?v=1.2.0']",http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/all-blue-eyed-people-have-common-ancestor-0/,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'A common ancestor. #StopClickBait', 'spoilerPublisher': 'Stop Clickbait - WTF'}",['descended from a single European'],"[[[0, 40], [0, 72]]]",['phrase']

I also did it because I was sick of my single status dictating the way I looked.Once I booked the appointment, though, the panic set in. Did I make the right decision? Would my hair fall out? What if I turned into a hideously ugly beast? These fears were further heightened when my original colorist wasn\'t available for the double-process. At the last minute, I was ushered into the warm and welcoming hands of the team over at Hairstory Studio in New York City — specifically colorist and mega-babe Roxie Darling Roxie put me at ease. ""It will change your life because you will be received so much differently,"" she says. ""People\'s eyes are naturally drawn to light, and naturally drawn away from darkness."" Basically, I was about to become Daenerys Targaryen. Bring it on.So, on the morning of May 18, I took one last selfie as a brunette, grabbed a coffee, and headed over to Hairstory for my transformation. Ahead, see what the experience of going blond was like. And if you have any questions, please leave them below!

(If you don't agree, I'm sorry, but I don't understand you.) Now, scientists have gone and done something incredibly cool—they figured out a new way to cook the grain that could cut its calories in half...or more."", 'New research was presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society, and revealed that adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water with a half-cup of non-fortified white rice, letting it simmer for 20 to 40 minutes, then refrigerating it for 12 hours may reduce the number of calories your body takes in by 50 to 60 percent.', 'Like I said: Seriously cool.', ""The researchers explained that rice contains two kinds of starch—one that is easily digestible, and one that's resistant. Our bodies don't have the enzymes needed to digest the resistant kind, which means it can't break down that starch and transform it into the sugar that typically gets absorbed into the bloodstream. If you have extra sugar in your bloodstream, that gets turned into fat, which we know is no good. In other words, the scientists wanted to find a way to get the rice to have more resistant starch, rather than digestible ones, to avoid that extra sugar in the body."", 'This is where the coconut oil comes in. Adding it to the cooking process makes the starch granules resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, and then letting the rice cool for 12 hours pushes the process along. Translation: Same amount of rice, fewer calories into the body.', ""Bonus: You don't have to eat the rice cold to get the desired effect. Reheating it the next day won't affect results, the researchers found."", ""No word yet on whether it works on brown rice, or if other oils will do the same thing, but more testing will be done to figure all that good stuff out.

As the opening credits rolled, a subtle but important change was made to the animation, causing fans of the show to shout with glee. Did you miss it? Observant viewers spotted it right away.', 'Prior to Sunday’s finale, the castle at Winterfell was adorned with the gruesome Bolton sigil, which is a picture of a flayed man hanging upside-down. It’s a nasty image but one that’s meant to strike fear into the Bolton’s enemies; the house was infamous for the centuries-old practice, and because Ramsay had taken over Winterfell, the sigil was prominently displayed in the show’s opening credits.', 'But as of Sunday’s finale, the Stark sigil was back in its rightful place. It was a subtle change but a big moment for the show because of how important ""Battle of the Bastards"" was. Fans were understandably pumped about the change; all seems right in the Game of Thrones universe—at least for now.', 'Also notable is that it reflects Jon’s newfound status as King in the North. Because Jon is thought to be a bastard, custom dictates the colors of the sigil be reversed. Instead of a gray direwolf on a white background, it’s now a white wolf on a gray background. Not an insignificant change, especially because Jon’s new nickname is White Wolf.', 'With winter finally here, can Jon ensure the survival of Winterfell?

Mounting evidence has linked an unhealthy gut microbiota with inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes.', 'This new study is one of the first to suggest that not getting enough sleep is one way of making our gut bacteria unhealthy, Cedernaes explained. ', 'The researchers followed nine individuals who spent two nights sleeping in a lab for eight and a half hours, and then another two nights of sleeping in a lab for only four and a half hours.', 'The study included a fairly small number of people, but the strength behind the data is that the researchers were able to compare the effects of varied sleep levels on gut bacteria within the same individuals. Plus, they only included subjects who reported having gotten consistent sleep and regularly timed meals the week before the study, which meant everyone’s gut bacteria started out at a somewhat typical level.', 'The data showed that getting less sleep didn’t necessarily change which gut bacteria the individuals had. But getting less sleep did change the levels of specific strains of bacteria. The amount of certain types of bacteria decreased by nearly 50 percent ― and that was after only two nights of not getting enough sleep.', 'The finding was significant because the wrong balance of bacteria in our gut is thought to be one of the big factors that cause obesity in some individuals, Cedernaes explained. ', 'What’s more, the ratios of specific strands of gut bacteria observed after individuals had not gotten a full night’s sleep mirrored the levels of the same gut bacteria previously observed in people who were obese or had other metabolic diseases.', '""Gut bacteria are a crucial, natural component of our bodies,"" Cedernaes said. ""[They] break down fibers that we cannot digest otherwise. They can also help us extract nutrients."" ', 'There was yet another interesting finding from the study. The individuals were 20 percent less sensitive to the effects of insulin after having less sleep ― a potential diabetes risk ― compared to the days after the nights they had slept longer. ', 'Sleep loss has been linked to decreased insulin sensitivity in previous studies, Cedernaes said. And while his new research did not necessarily suggest the effect was a result of the gut bacteria changes, the link is still an important observation because over time, constant insulin insensitivity is a well-established driver of diabetes. ', 'Additional, longer studies will be necessary to prove that the gut bacteria changes observed after a few nights of insufficient sleep are linked with the various metabolic diseases thought to be connected to chronic sleep loss, like obesity, diabetes and heart disease. But the new data makes a strong case, Cedernaes said ― a strong case for catching your Zs.']",The Terrifying Way Not Sleeping Enough Actually Changes Your Gut,"It could be upping your risk of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.","Sleep,obesity,Diabetes,gut bacteria",,,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': None, 'spoilerPublisher': None}",['This new study is one of the first to suggest that not getting enough sleep is one way of making our gut bacteria unhealthy'],"[[[3, 0], [3, 123]]]",['passage']

If you want to give your charming blended-family comedy an ironic name like Trophy Wife, don""t be surprised if your target demographic takes it literally and stays far away. (See also Terriers, Selfie, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...)', 'Now, Buffy the Vampire Slayer ran seven seasons, was never in danger of cancellation at any point (it jumped networks after season 5 only because UPN was looking to steal a hit from its rival the WB), launched a long-running (and, eventually, very good) spin-off in Angel, was beloved by its fans, and helped define the identity of an entire TV network for the short but memorable existence of the WB. By any standard you want to measure, Buffy was a success.', 'Except maybe this one: If you tell someone who""s never watched it that a show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer is among the best TV dramas of all time, they will roll their eyes at you and change the subject to something less divisive, like immigration policy.', 'Would a Buffy the Vampire Slayer by any other name have been a crossover hit rather than a cult classic, or won more awards, or simply have been an easier sell to non-fans? Certainly, you can imagine WB executives thinking that, which is why they briefly tried to get Joss Whedon to shorten the title to just Slayer.', 'Whedon held firm, and not just because it might have created confusion between the show and the thrash band that brought the world songs like ""Reign in Blood"" and ""Mandatory Suicide."" He knew that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the perfect title for his series, because it captured the exact spirit of what he was planning to make.', 'You could give it a more serious or distinguished title, but no matter the packaging, the show inside would be about a vapid teenage girl, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who discovered that her destiny was to protect humankind from vampires, demons, and other creatures of the underworld, and a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy. The name tells you all of that, and suggests that if you""re turned off by it, you""re probably not going to like the series to which it""s applied.', 'It was a tonal balance that director Fran Rubel Kuzui didn""t even bother attempting with the campy Buffy movie adapted from Whedon""s first script. The show, though, would have room for many different emotions, all juggled expertly by Gellar, Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan, and the rest of the cast. It was a series made cheaply even by the standards of TV""s fifth-place network, but it almost never seemed ridiculous despite the primitive effects and awkward stunt-doubling for Gellar. If it wanted to make you laugh at a bit of witty banter (""I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide until it goes away.""), it could. If it wanted its latest monster to creep you out, it found the most disturbing context possible. And if it wanted to make you cry, it was pointless to try fighting it.', 'If anything, the exaggerated nature of the various undead villains only made the high school setting more effective, because what is adolescence if not a time when every problem gets blown wildly out of proportion?', 'In the real world, a girl whose boyfriend started treating her badly after they finally have sex wouldn""t need to worry that he had turned pure evil, as happened with Buffy and her vampire love interest Angel (David Boreanaz), but it might feel that way for a while. And a real teen boy going through the changes of puberty might occasionally imagine himself a monster, but laconic guitar player Oz (Seth Green) actually transformed into a werewolf every time the moon was full.', 'Turning monsters into metaphors for teenage emotional turmoil was a clever gambit, and one that played particularly well during the show""s three seasons set in high school. Buffy is (by our rankings, anyway) one of the best TV shows ever set in high school, but it wasn""t entirely immune to the same problems that eventually beset all such shows when their characters head to college. Even so, those later seasons still had a knack for landing on the right parallel between the supernatural and the universal, like Buffy""s little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) literally being put on earth to cause her problems (which in this case involved the literal end of the world).', '(Those later years also offered some thrilling formal experiments, including ""Hush,"" an homage to silent horror movies, involving demons who rob people of the ability to speak or scream; ""The Body,"" a stripped-down outing where Buffy confronts the mundane reality of her mother""s death from natural causes; and the musical episode ""Once More, with Feeling,"" where a curse forces everyone to express their feelings through song.)', 'Back to that title. Whedon once suggested to the New York Times, ""If I made Buffy the Lesbian Separatist, a series of lectures on PBS on why there should be feminism, no one would be coming to the party, and it would be boring. The idea of changing culture is important to me, and it can only be done in a popular medium.""', 'Whedon didn""t invent feminism in TV storytelling, or even the idea of cross-pollinating it with fantasy and sci-fi tropes. (For much of its run, Buffy overlapped with Xena: Warrior Princess.) But he created one of the finest examples of it, and wrapped it up in a wildly entertaining package that included a name that may have made some potential viewers roll their eyes, but that made enough of them smile and think this might just be a show for them.', 'And it was.']",TV (THE BOOK): Why ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’ was one of TV’s best shows ever,"In an excerpt from TV (THE BOOK), Alan Sepinwall writes about the greatness of Joss Whedon's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" starring Sarah Michelle Gellar.","sepinwall, buffy the vampire slayer, tv the book","['http://p.uproxxcdn.com/photo/106987/profile', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=722969591073270&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/bmw-feat-uproxx-1.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1', 'https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l68nb&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0', 'http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/hitfixharleyteasuicidesquad.jpgwp-content/uploads/2016/08/tv-the-book-buffy.jpg?quality=100&w=650&h=433', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/150964.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1', 'http://dbg52463.moatads.com?a=5a7216d001e44d7f8e401aa5705d27f8', 'http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l68nb&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0', 'http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/ryan-murphy.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nodapl-wells-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1', 'http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8430760&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/top-chef-feat-uproxx-2.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/weird-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/fastlane-header.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1', 'http://p.uproxxcdn.com/content/default-avatar.jpg', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/tv-the-book-buffy.jpg?quality=100&w=650', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/starter-jacket-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1', 'http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73t-O7FWprUTo.gif', 'http://d5i9o0tpq9sa1.cloudfront.net?a=5a7216d001e44d7f8e401aa5705d27f8', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/jeff-sessions-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/alan-sepinwall.jpg?quality=100&w=48', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/carl-ichan-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/future-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/grohlsteen-feature.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/sharp-dressed-man-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/spice-girls-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ice-ramp-feature.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/chef-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/netflix-theater-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/kevin-gates-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1', 'https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/sampha-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1']",http://m.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/tv-the-book-why-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-was-the-best-possible-name-for-that-show,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'because it was.', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}","['a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy.

The terrorist attacks by Daesh (also known as ISIS or ISIL) in Europe, coupled with hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East have strengthened xenophobia, Islamophobia, and more generally, hatred of foreigners. Daesh itself is a byproduct of the invasion of Iraq that led to the emergence of al-Qaeda in Iraq, morphing into its present state as a result of the wars in Libya and Syria. Can things get any worse? Not only can they, we should expect new wars in the Middle East if Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate for president is elected next November. Even a glance at her record and the neoconservatives’ enthusiasm for her presidency indicate how likely new wars in the Middle East will be.', 'Hillary Clinton is a hawk and warmonger. People often point to her vote in 2002 for going to war in Iraq and her enthusiasm for it. After all, it was during her husband’s presidency that toppling the regime of Saddam Hussein became the official policy of the United States. But, her track record of starting and supporting wars, and siding with despots is much deeper than Iraq. She supported the coup in Honduras in 2009 and in Ukraine in 2014; was the leading advocate of the U.S. and NATO intervention in Libya that turned that economically advanced nation into a hub for all types of terrorist groups; laughed shamelessly at the news of Muammar Ghaddafi’s murder; supported extra-judicial assassinations by drones; backed escalation of the war in Afghanistan ordered by President Obama, and has taken an extremely hawkish stance toward Russia. And as Secretary of State she supported massive sale of advanced US weapons to Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Persian Gulf area, all reactionary dictatorships, the same weapons that are being used to attack Yemen.', 'The only ""accomplishments"" that she is still lacking are starting a war with Iran and invading Syria. If she is elected president, she may get to add both to her ""impeccable"" track record of war, bloodshed and destruction and in the process spark World War III, if it has not already begun as a result of US policy toward the Middle East.', 'Clinton considers Syria and Iran closely linked. In fact, most objective experts and analysts do believe that the war in Syria has a lot to do with Iran, its strategic alliance with Syria, its use of Syrian territory to help the Lebanese Hezbollah, and more generally what the Sunni Arab regimes of the region consider as the ""Shiite crescent"" – the alliance between the Shiites in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Lebanon.', 'So, before the war began in Syria in 2011, she supported secret negotiations between Israel and Syria as a way of separating the latter from Iran. But, the negotiations failed, as they always do, due to Israel’s intransigence. Thus, to her destroying Syria in order to topple Bashar al-Assad became the pathway for attacking Iran, which she views as necessary for Israel’s sake, as the Clintons have deep connections to Israel and its lobby in the United States', 'Her advocacy of direct US intervention in Syria began carefully. One of her top aides, Ann-Marie Slaughter who was director of policy planning at the State Department from 2009-2011, published a piece in the New York Times in February 2012 advocating foreign military intervention in Syria. Clinton herself became a leading force in putting together the so-called ""friends of Syria"" group, consisting of several Western nations and the very Arab regimes that despise Iran and have played the most important role in keeping the war continuing in Syria, namely, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, as well as Turkey. The group is similar to the Contact Group on Libya, also known as ""friends of Libya,"" which consisted essentially of the same countries and was created to help the opposition forces in Libya in 2011, and we all know what that help led to.', 'But, Hillary Clinton has gone even further. In an interview with the CNN she claimed Syria and Iran (as well as Russia) helped creating the Daesh, saying, ""ISIS was primarily the result of the vacuum in Syria caused by Assad first and foremost. Aided and abetted by Iran and Russia.""', 'Despite Clinton’s skepticism about a nuclear agreement with Iran, P5+1 and Iran signed the historic nuclear agreement in July 2015 after Iran made many significant concessions. After the nuclear accord the hope was that rapprochement between Iran and the United States would slowly develop. At the same time, it became crystal clear to practically everyone, from the President and his Vice President Joe Biden, to even the editors of the New York Times that Saudi Arabia and its allies are the main sponsors of terrorism in the Middle East. They are also raping the poor nation of Yemen with US logistic and military support.', 'Yet, Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old worn out songs and espousing the same failed policies toward Iran: more sanctions, more military threats, and more diplomatic pressure. This is of course neither new nor surprising. Along with the neocons, the Clintons have always been Iran’s number one enemy in the US political establishment.', 'The cliché in the West is that it is Iran that does not want improved relations with the West. That is not true, at least not when Iranian reformists, moderates, and pragmatists have been in power. Three times over the past 20 years the Iranian reformists and moderates have tried to improve the relations between their nation and the United States, and in each case the Clintons have either prevented the rapprochement or, as it is happening now, try to scuttle it.', 'In May 1995 former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist then but allied firmly with the reformists now, made a gesture of reconciliation toward the US by awarding the American oil company Conoco a major contract to develop a large offshore oil field in the Persian Gulf, although a European oil company had actually won the bidding for the contract. But, instead of responding in kind, Bill Clinton imposed total trade embargo on Iran in 1996 as part of his absurd, and ultimately failed ""dual containment"" policy according to which both Iran and Iraq were supposed to be contained and put in a strategic box.', 'Then, in 1998 former reformist President proposed ""dialogue among civilizations"" as a cautious approach to open dialogue between the two nations. Not only had Khatami won the presidential elections in 1997 in a landslide, his allies would sweep the first nationwide elections for city councils in fall of 1998 and for the Majles[Iranian parliament] in February 2000. But, once again, instead of making a major gesture toward Iranian democrats by lifting the economic sanctions, or at least suspending them, Bill Clinton announced that Iran could export pistachio, carpet and caviar to the United States, as if that would impress any Iranian. The Clinton administration claimed that it was seriously seeking formal dialogue with Iran, but Khatami was not interested, unless major sanctions against Iran would first be lifted, which were not.', 'After Hillary Clinton was elected a Senator from New York in 2000, she supported every resolution by Congress imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran. All such sanctions are illegal because they have not been approved by the United Nations Security Council. As Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton took the lead in putting together a coalition of Western nations that imposed ""the toughest sanctions"" in history on Iran. The sanctions hurt the lives of tens of millions of ordinary Iranians. Now that she is running for President again, Clinton’s campaign brags about her role in putting in place the sanctions, as she does in her memoir as Secretary of State, Hard Choices.', 'In an interview with ABC in 2008, when Mrs. Clinton was running for President, she was asked what she would do if Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons, to which she responded, ""I want the Iranians to know that if I’m the president, we will attack Iran. In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel we would be able to totally obliterate them"" (emphasis mine). Iran did not and does not have nuclear weapons and Clinton knew it, but she did not even declare that if Iran attacked Israel, which is highly unlikely if not impossible (unless Israel attacks first), she would defend Israel. Her threat to obliterate Iran, a very large country, can be accomplished by only one means: Attacking Iran with nuclear weapons.', 'Even though Clinton’s most important ""accomplishment"" as Secretary of State, namely, attacking Libya under the guise of ""humanitarian intervention,"" which was nothing but naked military aggression, has been a total catastrophe, in interviews with the BBC and Voice of America in October 2011 she claimed that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship. While the leaders of Iran’s Green Movement, a democratic and peaceful movement that emerged after Iran’s fraudulent presidential elections of June 2009, rejected any US help, Clinton said in the interviews that if they had asked for help, the US was prepared to help them the way it helped Libyan rebels. In other words, the US would have tried regime change in Iran.', 'Although Hillary Clinton claims that she supports the nuclear accord with Iran, she never misses a chance to demonize and belittles Iran. In a speech at the Brookings Institution last September, Clinton declared, ""I don’t see Iran as our partner in implementing this agreement. I believe Iran is the subject of the agreement"" (emphasis mine), as if Iran is a banana republic that is subject to US will. In an article in TheJewish Journal she threatened Iran again,', '""We have to send Iran an unequivocal message. There can be no doubt in Tehran that if Iran’s leaders violate their commitments not to seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear weapons, the United States will stop them. They will test our resolve with actions like their provocative ballistic missile test, for which we should impose new sanctions designations. They need to understand that America will act decisively if Iran violates the nuclear agreement, including taking military action if necessary."" (emphasis added).', 'Clinton’s rhetoric regarding Iran, even after the nuclear accord, only creates trouble for the administration of President Hassan Rouhani in the midst of his fierce power struggle with Tehran’s hardliners. By taking a hardline toward the nuclear agreement and improved relations with Iran, Hillary Clinton is a strong ally of Iranian hardliners who also do not want any rapprochement with the United States.', 'In addition to constantly demonizing Iran, Hillary Clinton is always looking for ways of imposing new economic sanctions on Iran to carry favor with the pro-Israel lobby and its rich donors. For example, it is well known that Iranian hardliners were, and still are opposed to the nuclear agreement with P5+1, just as the neocons and the extreme right in the United States opposed it and still do. So, the Iranian hardliners have tried to demonstrate their unhappiness with the nuclear accord, and one way of doing so, in addition to creating other problems for the Rouhani administration, has been testing ballistic missiles. The missiles are purely defensive weapons meant to deter Israel and the tests, unlike what the opposition to the nuclear accord in the United States claims, do not violate UN Security Council Resolution 2231 that was issued after the nuclear accord to endorse it. Despite these glaring facts, after the missile tests, Mrs. Clinton quickly called for new sanctions against Iran.', 'During the primary season the Clinton campaign slammed Senator Sanders’ suggestion that the US and Iran should have closer relations. Jake Sullivan, Hillary Clinton’s senior policy adviser, said on January 21, ""This proposal [by Sanders] to more aggressively normalize relations and to move to warm relations with Iran not only breaks with President Obama’s policy, it breaks with the sober and responsible diplomatic approach that’s been working for the United States."" This is not surprising. Hardliners everywhere are allies of each other and feed one another, and Clinton and Tehran’s hardliners are no exception.', 'Not only does Hillary Clinton not want improved relations with Iran, she has been itching to find an excuse start a war with that nation and, thus, she constantly demonizes Iran. But, in addition to demonizing Iran, she also lies about that nation brazenly. For example, similar to Benjamin Netanyahu she always refers collectively to Iran, Daesh and the Palestinian group Hamas, as if they are allies. Iran has been fighting Daesh in both Syria and Iraq. Iran cut off its financial aid to Hamas after that organization refused to back Bashar al-Assad in Syria. There is absolutely no relation between Hamas and Daesh. In fact, many senior Israeli officers have made it clear that they prefer Hamas to run Gaza, because the alternative would be either Daesh or one of the terrorist groups allied with it,', 'Why is Mrs. Clinton so anti-Iran? I can think of at least two reasons. One is that Hillary Clinton has never given up her imperial ambitions to reshape the Middle East, because she believes in American ""exceptionalism"" and always speaks about ""American global leadership,"" which only means world dominance. She sees Iran as an impediment to her ambitions for the Middle East. Why does she want to reshape the Middle East and possibly change the borders? This brings us to the second reason for her being anti-Iran. Clinton is an Israel ""firster."" Anything that she wants for the Middle East is intended for making the region as ""safe"" for Israel as possible. Clinton is not bothered by the fact that Israel is run by the far right with expansionist ambitions. To see this, all one has to do is listening to her speech at the annual meeting of AIPAC in March.', 'When asked during her first Democratic presidential debate last October ""which enemy are you most proud of,"" Hillary Clinton included ""the Iranians"" among them. This was truly disturbing. Was she talking about 80 million Iranians? If she meant the Iranian government, why did she not say so? Why did she not make it clear that she meant, for example, Tehran’s hardliners? Apparently, Hillary Clinton considers all Iranians as the enemy, which is truly disturbing.', 'Those who argue that we should vote for Clinton as the lesser of two evils in the upcoming presidential elections are truly misguided. Yes, for decades if not longer elections in the United State have been reduced to choosing between bad and worse. But, not this time. Hillary Clinton is simply as terrible as Donald Trump, if not worse. Expect new catastrophic wars in the Middle East, especially one with Iran, if she is elected.', 'This article (Expect Hillary to Do This Almost Immediately If She Wins in November) by Muhammad Sahimi, originally appeared on AntiWar.com and was used with permission.

Almost immediately after conception, a plug forms in the cervix and sits at the top of the vagina. This plug stops any other sperm from entering the uterus and getting to a second egg.', 'Third, there are physical and chemical changes that happen to the inner lining of the uterus in pregnancy. These changes usually stop a second fertilised egg from being able to attach to the uterine wall.', 'Even so, some animal species manage to get around all these barriers.

However, just because you can do something, doesn\'t mean you have to. The development team wants players of the new game to be abler to make their own decision as to how to play the game. This has apparently worked out so well that there\'s one major mechanic in the game you don\'t ever need to touch. I had a chance to sit down with both Watch Dogs 2 as well as the game\'s creative director where I learned that it\'s possible to beat Watch Dogs 2 without ever firing a gun. Something interesting is our LV Director, he finished the game without using the shooting mechanic...He used takedowns because sometimes in stealth you have to use them, but he never shot anyone. This is kind of our goal. You don\'t have to kill people and you don\'t have to shoot. Can we achieve that? Sometimes it\'s very difficult in a certain context, but we did it, so I\'m super proud of that actually. The great appeal of open world games is that they\'re supposed to give you a variety of ways to attack any objective. However, quite often those same games tend to push you down a particular path, so one game mechanic is important in one mission and another is the focus later on. Ubisoft has tried to design Watch Dogs 2 so that players have more control. Jonathan Morin, the Creative Director of Watch Dogs 2 told me that while playing the game without guns isn\'t easy, it is possible. Instead, there are greater opportunities for using hacking in order to reach your goal. Every hackable object can be hacked in different ways, rather than just one, meaning that you have more control over how your environment reacts to you. The addition of rovers and drones also means that the player can get access to more areas without actually having to step foot in a place where you might be spotted. As a fan of the hacking aspect of the original Watch Dogs but not so much the Grand Theft Auto style gunplay, this more wide open world sounds much more interesting. I found myself far too often needing to fight off waves of enemies with a gun in the first game when I would much rather stun them with a hackable object before they even knew I was there. While my hands-on time with Watch Dogs 2 was limited, I can say I also never used a gun. Christopher Morin told me to ""think like a hacker"" while playing Watch Dogs 2, to consider how you can use the systems to solve the problems that you\'re dealing with. It gives the impression that the hacking aspect of the game has been set up more like a puzzle where the player will need to figure out how to hack the different parts of the game in order to solve it. However, the most important part of making that work is that you have to believe there is a solution. Based on the fact that you can apparently beat the game using only hacks and takedowns, it would appear the solution is possible. Will you try to beat Watch Dogs 2 without using a gun?

Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events, is purely coincidental."" The cut-and-paste legal rider must be the most boring thing in every movie that features it. Who knew its origins were so lurid?', 'For that bit of boilerplate, we can indirectly thank none other than Grigori Rasputin, the famously hard-to-assassinate Russian mystic and intimate of the last, doomed Romanovs. It all started when an exiled Russian prince sued MGM in 1933 over the studio’s Rasputin biopic, claiming that the American production did not accurately depict Rasputin’s murder. And the prince ought to have known, having murdered him.', 'Here’s the story. In 1916, the fabulously wealthy, Oxford-educated Prince Felix Yusupov was one of several Russian aristocrats agonizing over the unseemly influence that Rasputin—the magical healer, charismatic lech, and peasant—had over the czar and, particularly, the czarina. In December, Yusupov invited Rasputin to his palace, where he offered him cyanide-laced cakes and then shot him.', 'Although the czarina was distraught, the czar let Yusupov off lightly, exiling the prince and his wife Irina. (In doing so, he inadvertently spared them from the impending slaughter of the revolution.)', 'A Slate Plus Special Feature: Radio Drama Has Returned to the Spotlight—Now What? The Culture Gabfest’s producer explains why radio drama isn’t dead. Listen to this special Slate Plus bonus segment by joining – your first two weeks are free.', 'Sixteen years later, MGM produced Rasputin and the Empress, based on those events. Its big coup was casting the three Barrymore siblings—stars of stage and silent film—in the lead roles. Lionel played Rasputin, Ethel the czarina, and John (grandfather of Drew) was ""Prince Paul Chegodieff,"" a composite, who murders Rasputin.', 'Yusupov, now penniless in Paris, heard about the film and thought it defamatory. He argued audiences would recognize him in the fictional assassin—in part because he’d publicly cashed in on his infamy, penning a braggy memoir about killing Rasputin. He wasn’t wrong: The New York Times, in its review, noted that Chegodieff was ""really intended to represent [Yusupov].""', 'But having copped to being a murderer, Yusupov couldn’t build much of a libel case. Instead, he alleged that Rasputin and the Empress in fact defamed his wife.', 'In the film, Chegodieff’s wife is ""Princess Natasha,"" a supporter of Rasputin. But the mystic, wary of her husband, hypnotizes and rapes her, rendering Natasha—by his logic, with which she agrees—unfit to be a wife. Yusupov contended that as viewers would equate Chegodieff with Yusupov, so would they link Natasha with Irina. But while Yusupov was portrayed more or less accurately, Irina and Rasputin had never met. (The scene also libeled Rasputin, but him being dead, you could say anything, then as now: ""Rasputin sucks,"" ""Rasputin liked to caress his big beard and give it little kisses,"" etc.)', 'An MGM researcher had pointed out this factual discrepancy to the studio during production and warned that the Yusupovs could sue; the studio fired her. MGM was satisfied, dramatically, with the rape scene, despite there being no basis for it in real life. If it was shock they were interested in, one could imagine them constructing a similar scene around Rasputin and the czarina—about whom there were prurient rumors, which Rasputin himself encouraged by whipping his dick out in a restaurant and boasting of giving it to ""the old girl""—but MGM couldn’t do that after casting a real-life brother and sister in those roles.', 'Poster via Wikimedia Commons', 'Irina Yusupov sued the studio, and the jury found in her favor, awarding her £25,000, or about $125,000. MGM had to take the film out of circulation for decades and purge the offending scene for all time.', 'What proved to be MGM’s undoing was its lack of deniability. Unwisely, they’d prefaced the film with this: ""This concerns the destruction of an empire ... A few of the characters are still alive—the rest met death by violence."" From that, audiences could logically infer that the Yusupovs, being the only relevant characters still alive, were represented as the Chegodieffs.', 'A justice in the case told MGM that the studio might have stood a better chance had they incorporated a disclaimer stating the exact opposite: that the film was not intended as an accurate portrayal of real people or events.', 'Apparently overcautious in the wake of the landmark lawsuit, the film industry slapped that wording on everything. For decades, films disclaimed absolutely any relationship to reality—even when it was patently untrue.

Recent evidence suggests that these tiny lions see us as inessential landlords, or rubbish, fur-lacking kittens. A new internet craze involving our feline companions has unveiled another piece of strange information: For some utterly bizarre reason, they appear to be terrified – utterly terrified – of cucumbers.', 'In the vast majority of the videos, cat owners are seen sneaking up behind their pets as they’re facing the other way – mostly eating – and placing the green, elongated vegetable behind them. As the cat turns around and spots the unexpected item, it loses its mind, leaps into the air, and gets away from it as fast as it can. In some videos, the cats then engage in a stare down with the cucumber, waiting in vain for it to make its first move.', 'But the question remains: Why on Earth are cats frightened by these innocuous vegetables?', 'To be fair, there aren’t any videos of cats seeing a cucumber from a distance and then walking up to interrogate it, so perhaps it’s the unexpected sight of a cucumber behind them that’s frightening, not the cucumber itself: An unexpected pineapple would likely be just as jarring. As it turns out, Dr. Roger Mugford, a specialist in animal behavior, told the Telegraph: ""I think that the reaction is due to the novelty and unexpectedness of finding an unusual object secretly placed whilst their heads were down in the food bowl.""', 'Cats are shown to be suspicious of anything that moves rapidly, makes a lot of noise, or lights up erratically: essentially, anything that they don’t fully understand, which isn’t really that different from most animals, including humans. It’s also worth noting that cats are mostly solitary animals, and humans are as sociable as animals can be – so they’re baffled enough by us as it is. Freaking them out with unexpected cucumbers probably isn’t helping.', '""Cats have to be suspicious of the unknown: It could represent the danger of a snake or another predator,"" Mugford continued. ""I suspect that there would be the same reaction to a model spider, a plastic fish or a human face mask.""', 'Well, there’s only one way to find out. This is, after all, for science.

Thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (In Contention editor Kris Tapley, HuffPost Entertainment\'s own Mike Ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (Variety critic Scott Foundas, The Wrap critic Alonso Duralde). Heed the words from the former camp: ""Captain Phillips"" stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons\' action films from the last few years, on par with Kathryn Bigelow\'s ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and well ahead of Ben Affleck\'s Best Picture-winning ""Argo.""', ""The reason is Hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from Tom Hanks since the early 2000s. His Richard Phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by Catherine Keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the History Channel and likes Tommy Lee Jones movies. Yet as Greengrass keeps turning the screws on Phillips and his situation, that cool demeanor begins to crack, shatter and, later, turn to dust. Hanks is put through the ringer -- Greengrass' closed-quarters camera work keeps in him the action even as things get impossibly physical -- and the results are breathtaking.

The newcomer plays Muse, the lead Somali pirate in the film, a relatively decent man turned to evil behavior by his standing in life. Abdi (and Barkhad Addirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M.

This generally holds true when your denim is worn under normal conditions, such as everyday street wear.', 'Bacteria, skin cells, and sweat are transferred to our pants from our own body but ""skin microorganisms are generally not hazardous to ourselves,"" said Rachel McQueen, a professor of human ecology at the University of Alberta in Canada. McQueen\'s research focuses on the development and retention of odors in textiles.', '""There are environments where having sterile clothing is important,"" McQueen said. That would be true in a hospital, for example, where clothing can transfer infections. However, ""sanitizing your hands is going to be a more important issue here than washing your jeans,"" she said.', ""A few years ago, one of McQueen's students wore his jeans for 15 months straight without a single wash and then tested the level of bacteria on them. The student-teacher team was surprised to find that the unwashed jeans carried nearly the same amount of bacteria as those same pants after they had been washed and then worn for another 13 days."", '""What I found was just normal skin flora,"" McQueen told The National Post in 2011. ""The counts were really, really similar. The bacteria load from the swabbed areas were pretty much the same.""', 'The freezing myth', ""Although not washing your jeans doesn't seem to pose any health risks, the smell could become a problem. Denim-heads have suggested freezing your jeans as a way to kill bacteria and the stench, although there is no scientific proof that this method is effective."", '""It is clear that freezing does not kill most of the bacteria,"" said Redl, ""but puts them in a dormant state."" Bacteria stops growing in the freezer, but will become active again once you slip your pants back on and those germs are warmed up by the heat of your body.', '""I think airing your jeans outdoors in the sunlight would be a more effective method of getting rid of odors and a lot of bacteria,"" said McQueen.']",Here's what happens if you never wash your jeans,The argument for not washing your jeans has traditionally been about making your denim last longer -- hot water and detergent can speed up how quickly your jeans fade.

The release date brought a fighter with many characters, lots of gameplay modes and frantic item-throwing fun. But nothing's perfect -- in the case of Smash Bros 4, the mulitplayer lag is a huge issue. Whether it be local multiplayer in Sm4sh or online, the game stutters early and often."", ""The game is superb -- which is why it pains us that no matter what stage we choose, our Smash Bros 4 fights always take place in Lag City. We got a hint of this when we did our review for SSB43DS but chalked it up to all other players being located halfway across the world in Japan. Now that the game's out in our country, we thought our lag issues would be alleviated. Boy were we wrong."", ""Now, don't get us wrong -- we agree with Louis CK . The fact that we can play a video game with anyone around the world is amazing. But Smash is serious business. Despite being a fighting game, the lag is pretty consistent. So, we quantified it."", '(Smash bros)', 'Super Smash Bros 4 Lag: Online Multiplayer', 'We began our testing using both the For Fun and For Glory modes on the 3DS. Similar to when I played Sm4sh for the review, we experienced constant lag throughout gameplay. During our For Fun plays, button presses were consistently between .30 to .40 milliseconds late. Not a huge amount obviously, though certainly noticeable.', ""During our 3rd match during For Fun while playing online using our home wifi network, Smash Bros 4 decided to leave us indefinitely in the training mode (just before the match begins). We're not sure if this was a network problem, someone dropped off, or just a glitch in the game. Without the ability to hit the Home Button we were forced to turn it off. On to For Glory then."", '(Smash Bros)', ""For Glory saw lag go as high as .63 milliseconds after buttons were pressed. Though similar to For Fun, the lag was consistent. If you're fine with pressing buttons twice just to make sure they register, you can complete a match relatively trouble free."", '(Smash Bros)', 'SSB4: Local Multiplayer', 'Playing Smash with our Bros in person was a different story. For some reason having everyone in the same room made our multiplayer lag experience worse than the online equivalent. I and two others with the game sitting in a circle (err, triangle) not more than 5 feet from each other ran into considerable lag when playing Super Smash Bros 4.', ""We played the game for nearly 3 hours using various characters and stages. In a set of about 15 stages, the first few went off without a hitch -- with the occasional hiccup. The same couldn't be said for the second half of our marathon Smash session."", ""5 of the latter 7 matches lagged uncontrollably to the point where the loading spinner appeared on screen telling us to wait. Having one player completely lose all their stock lives with only 2 fighters remaining on screen didn't help the situation. Despite having never moved physically, the rate of waiting for the throbber varied -- at times reaching 3-4 seconds."", 'In a 2nd round of local Smash Bros 4 multiplayer ""testing"" (read: playing in the office, for science!) 2 players was much easier on the system. The most lag we encountered occurred when 2 human players and a 3rd CPU player was thrown in the mix. Surprisingly, 2 human players and 2 CPUs resulted in no lag.', '(Smash Bros)', 'SSB4 Online Lag Fixes And Placebos', ""Having this much lag in a multiplayer game, especially one like Super Smash Bros 4, detracts from the overall experience. Though at least online the lag was consistent enough to get used to. The sporadic nature of local multiplayer's random loading dials and epic slow downs make more than 2 (human) player battles pretty annoying."", 'So guys, found out I had lag because of my #3ds aluminum case. #smashbros pic.twitter.com/wd5lW2PQnS — Raymond Lancione (@raylancione) October 7, 2014', ""If anyone's having #SmashBros lag online, apparently it gets better if you plug in the charger while playing. — It was me, Milu!

At the very least, we’ve confirmed that smooth play is possible under various conditions of external networks. During multi-player, you’re connected with another player and sending light amounts of data back and forth, so if the game feels laggy, it’s due to the connection speed. If you play when it’s laggy, then the person you’re playing with will experience the same lag, so it’s best to play when the connection is clear.', 'During development, there were cases where we had too many people and the connection became sluggish, so we turned off our cell phones and the connection would clear up. It’s best to avoid playing while streaming something or by a tethered connection. Free wi-fi spots are probably not very good either.""', '(Wordpress)', 'The Part Where I Complain About The 3DS Hardware', ""Something tells me the new 3DS was made because the current one can't handle Super Smash Bros. This is the first time a Smash game has been made available for handheld and already we've seen reports of broken circle pads and awkward control schemes . The 3DS charger improving the online performance likely hints at the processing power of Nintendo's hardware -- likely holding back in an effort to save battery life. Not to mention OG 3DS owners not getting access to the beloved C-stick."", ""Nintendo's hardware always lags behind the competition but they've been able to get around it by bringing us great games. But what happens when even your own killer first party title doesn't run properly on yesterday's hardware you swore by? Would the PS Vita have these lag issues? Could the Ice Climbers have part of Smash Bros for the iPhone ? (Not that you could ever seriously play Smash on a smartphone, but not the point)."", ""Though all in all, Smash players now that the 3DS version isn't the real experience. Having the game with us at all times is nice, but the real showdowns will take place on the Wii U -- in HD and with GameCube controllers in hand. If Nintendo can bring a smooth experience to the full edition of Super Smash Bros 4, fans may be likely to forgive the gaming company."", 'Are you experiencing lag in your online battles in Smash Bros 4?

I do all the time. Taking risks and going places you aren’t supposed to is a great adrenaline rush. Now, I’m not trying to promote trespassing of any kind. I’m a responsible adult....sometimes. The excitement of the unknown is what drives many people’s curiosity when they decide to finally give urban exploring a try. Maybe you’ll see a ghost, or find an abandoned safe. It’s never the same thing twice though. You really don’t have any idea what you’re going to find or discover. Well that was the driving force behind a man named Dan Bell and his recent decision to explore an abandoned apartment complex. It started out as a simple urban exploration video, but turned into something much more life-threatening in mere moments. Check out the pictures and video he captured, and how this attempt at urban exploration was almost his last.', 'He starts out his journey in a small alleyway formed by the abandoned building. This place looks like something out of a horror movie.', 'Dan had passed by this scary abandoned apartment for a few weeks, and just couldn’t seem to get it off his mind.', 'Dan had found blood and animals parts around different part of the property in a previous shorter visit. He had also found summoning markings around certain parts of the property. As with all great urban explorers however, this only made his curiosity grow with every step.', 'He climbed a ladder to reach an upper level of the apartment complex. Inside he found what you would expect to find in an old abandoned building.', 'Trash was littered through the maze of rooms and hallways. The paint was peeling off of every single wall, while some walls weren’t even standing anymore. Every step he took was a gamble that the floor would support his weight.', 'The remnant of what used to be tenants mail boxes for their apartments. This place definitely fell into serious decay after it was not longer being used.', 'Falling debris was a definite worry while walking through this place. It’s so old the wood is rotting and won’t support the weight it used too.', 'It became clearer and clearer that people had been in here after the place was abandoned. Apparently ""Tony"" wanted everyone to know he was there at one point.', 'Finding a spot to step onto without the threat of a nail in your foot was quite the exercise.', 'A tense moment came when Dan took a step, and the ground beneath him literally started to crumble and disintegrate. It’s a tense moment in an already tense video. He was extremely lucky that the floor never caved in on him during his visit.', 'After walking through the upper levels for a bit, Dan decides to climb back down the ladder and tackle the ground level floors. This would be a turning point in the video. What happens next is something that I would never want to experience.', 'Dan decided to check out an area up a flight of stairs. When he reached the top, he caught sight of something that just didn’t seem to fit with the rest of his surroundings.', 'Just an ordinary reusable grocery bag right. The Snapple sticking out of the bag makes it seem like it was definitely put here recently. Of course, someone who has already come this far is going to investigate even further!', 'Well damn! That’s a bunch of crack cocain ready to be sold! As soon as I saw this, my mood about this situation would have changed. This isn’t just a poke around an abandoned building anymore.', 'After examining the contents of the container, Dan understandably got seriously freaked out. This was clearly a crack house, and he was standing there with a dealers stash. People have gotten killed for less. Well guess what? The dealer comes back!', 'Pretty damn intense right?! This guy is seriously super lucky. I don’t have a doubt in my mind if these guys would have found him he would be dead. This building is definitely in the slums. If you watch the whole video, at around the 5:07 mark, you can clearly hear multiple gun shots ringing through the air in the general area. That right there would have probably be enough for me to say it’s time to go. Luckily Dan was able to wait out the crack dealer and his client and make a hasty getaway. You can clearly tell he is shaken up by the experience though as he is almost crying by the time he gets outside. He really was lucky to escape with his life.']",Guy Decides To Explore An Abandoned Building That Turned Out To Be Crack House,"Most people know better than to go sauntering into any old abandoned building that pops up along your path.

48776910-1a2f-4767-9380-45994535437b,4u2aq3,here's a controversial idea about china's economy that no one wants to hear,reddit,"['Reuters', 'For years, economists have been saying that China needs to ""rebalance"" its economy, and the government is on board with this daunting project.', 'That means the country is attempting to move from an economy based on investment in industrial manufacturing to one based on domestic consumption driven by regular Chinese people working in the services sector.', 'That is, China has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers.', 'But what if we\'ve got this all wrong? What if China is transitioning too early? That\'s what HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Jing Li have posited in a recent note, ""China\'s new challenge: Faster services expansion, slower productivity growth.""', 'From the note (emphasis added):', '""Both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that premature deindustrialisation in developing countries can be damaging. It blocks the main channel of productivity growth, and therefore reduces the economy\'s potential growth rate and its prospects of catching up with more advanced economies.', '""Based on the experience of some Latin American countries, a lack of adequate investment and a tendency of specialising according to short-term, rather than long-term, comparative advantage are common mistakes made by developing countries.', '""This kind of development strategy can result in an underdeveloped industrial sector and slow productivity growth. Given that China\'s GDP per capita is only 14% that of the US, we believe it is way too early to shift towards services-led growth.""', 'Work, work, work, work, work', ""What really worries HSBC is that the service sector's jobs, while in general more labor intensive, are less productive for the economy than jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. The bank's analysts point out that workers in the former are just 80% as productive as those in the latter."", 'HSBC', 'Arguing against a shift to service-led growth is a super controversial thing because the Chinese government has already made rebalancing a top project — if not in deed, then certainly in word. The reason for that is simple: debt.', 'China has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 280%. Most of that is concentrated in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. In 2009, when the world was falling apart, the Chinese government decided to just open the money spigots to keep its economy running at full steam.', 'That, coupled with a general lack of global demand for materials like steel and coal produced in Chinese factories, has led to overcapacity in those sectors.', ""So, to combat that overcapacity, China would like to have fewer people working the jobs where they're making the things that it seems the world has entirely too much of."", 'The rest of the world would love that, too. Last week, the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the Chinese economy , ""Evaluating the Financial Risks of China,"" and much of it focused on what that country\'s economic slowdown has done to the American steel industry.', ""During the hearing, Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, pointed out that 33 steel manufacturers have gone bankrupt since the 1990s. He also said that, between 2011 and 2015, the Chinese government claimed that 90 million tons of overcapacity in its steel market had been taken care of. In reality, 300 million tons had been added to China's steel output."", 'So what Gibson would like is for China to slow its production and wind the steel industry down.', ""The problem with this solution, says HSBC, is that moving away from industry and manufacturing means that China won't grow as fast — not just in the short term, but also in the long term."", 'From the note (emphasis added):', '""The efficiency loss during such a \'rebalancing\' can be huge. Between 2012 and 2015, the total number of migrant workers in the manufacturing sector declined by nearly 7m, compared with an increase of 5m in the three biggest services sectors (ie wholesale and retail, residential services, transportation and logistics). Based on 2015 statistics, each worker in the manufacturing sector generated RMB45,000 more output than their counterpart in the three biggest services sectors. Therefore, if all 5m workers had been employed in the manufacturing sector rather than services, China\'s total output in 2015 could have been RMB225bn higher, which is around 0.3% of annual GDP.""', ""HSBC suggests that the country makes more targeted and productive investments in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. But, to be honest, the Chinese government hasn't shown that kind of subtlety. Even now, banks continue to lend to unproductive corporations in order to keep workers employed and avoid a hard landing in the short term."", 'Meanwhile, the transition to the service sector continues.', 'Pretty controversial ideas, no?']",China is too quick to rebalance its services sector,China has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers. But what if we've got this all wrong?,,"['http://archive.is/C7nmo/75004f1c9d86615e372705672b42de0fd7eab2f4.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/884bd5f3473606cd62944801922df9d12fab538f.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/0e3aa04e727a1aa11e7cb001f2fb8d1d63f69abc.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/d81ef420e24ab9cf373896d5eabc0c0954867ee9.png', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==', 'data:image/gif;base64,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', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/a3bb67836583b1a8a5f0948b25c00561a4032645/scr.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/8fbd7a27c34486bc5be916890f254e9df542d287.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/ccb85aaeab4e03668fe63d612394bc0d62bac994.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/11433ae77e54b8f870386d4e4dccba291e11ff3f.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/ae0f5ac848ec9f536b4e1b777f79fccb70f01e3a.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/4c26a6e32ed3b810e9f2f42f37e271966028a5e6.jpg', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAID/AMDAwAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAEBMgA7', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/b9e526fbdd03f879a5e4943f982c3d90724f8678.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/f25653e8762005c2d0b10748d099732cb5a75ac4.png', 'data:image/png;base64,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', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/874e39991bae94e821269f1bbcafca65ab257627.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/25235944c4974dea5882763d960a1aca05cb58ef.jpg', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/b616f291734f7a6a9f280a2f422b265bd3687c23.png', 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/6ca8b935b1569d34b3cf35f14b1c8831886ed10f.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/431baa11f1fb5985e741a81c92f587b03987cde7.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/698a42ce71523d23eee80b8242bcbfba2d44d8ca.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/3d458fe9359fe171e5c493e3d73eb6589bb0cdce.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/2c5a19ac7e41b68819764640ef90a058d42fd506.png', 'http://archive.is/C7nmo/15530eb0dfeb7ce6794e226bade2ed0ed46996ed.png']",http://archive.is/C7nmo,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Their rebalancing to a service economy may be too hasty', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}",['China is too quick to rebalance its services sector'],"[[[-1, 0], [-1, 51]]]",['passage']
