Opened in 1973 in downtown Manhattan's East Village, the nightclub that originally intended to house country, bluegrass and blues music (hint its acronym) quickly became a breeding ground for bands like The Ramones, Talking Heads and The Police, among countless others."", 'The legacy of the club, which closed in 2006 over a rent dispute, is on display in a new movie that stars Alan Rickman as bemused owner Hilly Kristal. It\'s a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing Rickman, 67, play sinister Severus Snape in ""Harry Potter"" or Judge Turpin in ""Sweeney Todd."" The movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow Hogwarts alum Rupert Grint, who portrays one-third of derriere-bearing punk band The Dead Boys, alongside Justin Bartha and Bronson Adams. They\'re joined by a revolving door of notable faces, including Malin Akerman as Debbie Harry, Taylor Hawkins as Iggy Pop, Johnny Galecki as Terry Ork and Ashley Greene as Hilly\'s daughter Lisa.', ""HuffPost Entertainment snagged some phone time with Rickman and Grint, who were candid about their unfamiliarity with CBGB's legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project. Plus, Grint talks about his own punk phase and Rickman explains what Halloween used to mean for him."", 'What are you up to today?', 'Rickman: I\'m in New York. I\'m just here for three or four days for ""CBGB"" in New York and then back to work in England.', ""Grint: I'm rehearsing a play that will start [in London] in a couple of weeks. Yeah, so that's it."", 'Are you enjoying the theater work? Are you more of a theater guy or a film guy?', 'Grint: I don’t know, really. This is my first theater experience, and it’s very different. I wanted to just try it; it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. Just the thought of it scares me. I’ve kind of put it off for a long time, and I just thought it was a good time to do it. And it’s a great play and a really great cast with a great director, and it was just, yeah, I’m enjoying it.', 'Were you familiar with the legacy of CBGB as a breeding ground for the punk-rock scene prior to taking your roles in the movie?', 'Rickman: I wasn’t familiar with CBGB at all. I didn’t know about it and didn’t know its history. I hadn’t even really heard those four letters put together because at that time I was very much in England as a drama student and an art student, so it’s all been a new discovery to me. Obviously I was aware of some of the bands, but not that they’d all started in a club on the Bowery.', ""Grint: I didn't actually know a lot about it. I'd obviously heard of the name and the logo and seen it on T-shirts and stuff like that, but I didn’t really know how prolific it was in discovering some of my favorite bands. I love Talking Heads, and the whole punk thing was something I really loved. So, yeah, it was quite an education learning about it. And also Dead Boys, I wasn’t really familiar with them, and kind of listening and watching them on YouTube was amazing. They just had so much energy, and they were just disgusting. It was incredible."", 'Did you grow up listening to the music depicted in the movie?', 'Rickman: Obviously I was aware of the huge rise of The Police in England, and as an art student I was very much a fan of Talking Heads. And then Blondie, but I wasn’t a hard punk-rock fan at the time. But of course I was also very much around the height of The Beatles and The Stones, so it was like that was the lone star and everything spun off from there. And [Bob] Dylan, very much so. ... England in the ‘60s and the ‘70s was everything that history has said; it was phenomenally exciting, musically. One was very shaped by that.', 'Grint: It was that whole era that I liked. I like, obviously, The Sex Pistols and The Clash, Blondie as well, and The Ramones. Some amazing people performed on that stage. ... I went through a real punk phase not that long ago, and yeah, it was probably the reason why I decided to do it, because I have such a love for that.', 'Did you dress similarly to the character that you play at any point?', 'Grint: [Laughs] No, not at all. The dog collar was a new experience for me.', 'Not knowing much of the mythology of CBGB, how did you come to learn about your characters?', 'Rickman: What I really enjoyed and what made it interesting to play was the fact that he happened in direct contrast to the world of the club and what its history became. Because there was this big quiet, contained man who made a club for country music and it never ever played there. Along came punk, and he became like that deus ex machina, I suppose. I watched old interviews and DVDs. I listened to him talking to his mother and his daughter and journalists, so there was a lot of material for me.', 'Grint: Yeah, there wasn’t really a whole lot to go on. There are a few videos of him playing live at CBGB and a few interviews I watched. Yeah, and having [Dead Boys guitarist Cheetah Chrome] on set was quite a different thing. I had kind of a little bit of pressure because he was kind of watching every scene, and you’re trying to portray him and do him justice, and it’s quite a challenge.', 'So he was on set the whole time?', 'Grint: Yeah, he has a cameo. He plays the cab driver. He was lovely. He was such a nice guy. I was kind of surprised he was still alive.', 'Did he give you any notes while filming?', 'Grint: Not so much notes. It was just kind of watching him and being around him and listening to his stories and just listening, really, kind of absorbing a lot of that. And he was such a nice guy and we had a good time.', 'Was this movie your first instance of nudity on camera?', 'Grint: Yeah, I guess it was, yeah.', 'Were you comfortable with that? How did that go down?', 'Grint: Weirdly, yeah. It didn’t really feel that big a deal. It just kind of happened. I didn’t really think about it when I was getting ready for it, and yeah, it just kind of happened. I had some sort of sock, modesty thing, contraption. I don’t want to go into too much detail. And yeah, it was just sort of one of those things. There was quite a lot of that in the film. Especially from Justin [Bartha] as well. ... There’s quite a lot of ass in the film.', ""You had to try out an American accent in this role. Is there an accent out there that you'd be intimidated to have to use on camera?"", 'Rickman: I think every English actor is nervous of a Newcastle accent. That’s really difficult.', 'Grint: It’s quite fun just trying to work on it and get it right. I like that kind of challenge. A couple years ago, I did a film that required me to do a Liverpool accent. I don’t know if you’re familiar with that sound, but that was quite a hard one. It’s quite a harsh sound. But I enjoy that side of things.', 'Once you started exploring the role and got into The Dead Boys and their history, did you find yourself enjoying their music? What did you think of the band you were portraying?', 'Grint: I really love them. I listened to all their songs completely. Their songs are quite hard to play, not easy to listen to. But no, I really love then. I’ve always really wanted to be in a band, so this was kind of an opportunity to experience that. To go on stage and have the whole crowd there and the music.', 'Is music something you’d ever pursue?', 'Grint: I don’t know, probably not. I’ve tried to leverage it, but I just know it’s never going to happen.', 'Alan, you often play very dominant roles, very powerful people. What were your thoughts going into a character who was much more loose-goosey? Is it fun to shift gears and play that sort of character?', 'Rickman: I suppose, in my perspective, I’ve played as many of those as I have the other sort. It’s just some get more publicity or make more money at the box office or something. I’m perfectly happy to be Colonel Brandon in ""Sense & Sensibility"" as I am any of those powerful characters. It’s just part of an actor’s job, and you just alter the colors that you get out of the cupboard.', 'How was it to reunite? Had you seen each other since doing press for the eighth ""Harry Potter"" movie?', 'Rickman: No, because I think we’d both been so busy doing other things. But it was great to see him on the set, and it was great to watch all three of them. I saw Emma [Watson] the other night in London in a restaurant, and I saw Daniel [Radcliffe] recently in London because he was doing a play. It’s great to watch the three of them moving forward into the rest of their lives and being working actors and not trapped by one image.', 'Grint: Not really, no, actually. ... I love Alan. He’s always been one of my favorites. But yeah, it was quite weird seeing him in a whole new kind of environment because -- I’m trying to think back -- I don’t think I ever really saw him outside of that wig and cloak.', 'Which ""Potter"" co-star would you most like to reunite with?', 'Grint: There are so many. All of them. I’ve already loved working with them. I like Michael Gambon. He’s so cool; just a remarkable guy. I’ve worked with Julie Walters before as well. I love her, she’s great.', ""Now for something more fun. It's October. What's your favorite Halloween costume you've ever worn?"", 'Rickman: [Laughs] The thing about Halloween is, to me, it just means -- because it’s so different in England –- we used to have something called Bonfire Night, and we’d have fireworks. That’s disappeared and I know Halloween’s taken over. Halloween to me as a child was, the family would fill a bowl of water and you’d have apple bobbing in it, and you’d get apples out of a bowl of water. To me it just means a soaking wet shirt.', 'Grint: I liked Halloween. It never used to be a big thing when I was kid. We never really did it. But I actually had a good costume not that long ago. The last one, I dressed as a Play-Doh can that I made. You know Play-Doh?', 'Of course.', 'Grint: Well, literally, I actually made it. It was a yellow bin. I cut the bottom out and I just wore a yellow bin with a Play-Doh logo. With a yellow hat. It’s not very practical.', 'Do you have a favorite Halloween candy?', 'Rickman: I don’t even know what that means. The word ""chocolate"" would loom large.', 'Grint: A favorite Halloween candy? I don’t really know. I never trick-or-treated when I was younger because we lived on a block of houses that were all just kind of elderly people who were just scared to answer the door. But yeah, candy corn, that’s a big thing. I’ve tried that. That’s pretty great.', '""CBGB"" is out in limited release now.']","Alan Rickman & Rupert Grint On 'CBGB,' Reuniting Post-'Potter' And Favorite Halloween Costumes","The mythology of punk music's evolution can be traced back, more or less, to one singular staple: CBGB.

His New York Knicks had gotten out of Staples Center with a win over the Los Angeles Lakers and he'd gone an entire game without having to wave to nostalgic Lakers fans on the big screen."", '""I think the Lakers are trying to move away from that kind of stuff,"" Jackson said as we spoke briefly outside the Knicks\' locker room on Dec. 11.', 'There was such a distance in the way he said, ""The Lakers."" This, after all, is the man who won five NBA titles in Los Angeles and was still engaged to Lakers president Jeanie Buss. But that distance was real, and it had kept growing as the years went by and Jackson spent more and more time in New York, running the Knicks, and in Montana with his children and grandchildren during the offseason.', 'His connection with Los Angeles, and his fiancée, was simply too hard to maintain. On Tuesday night, Buss and Jackson announced that they were mutually ending their four-year engagement.', ""The announcement -- via their personal Twitter accounts -- brought an end to the NBA's version of Camelot."", ""Like the Camelot in Richard Burton's Broadway musical, this had always been an impossible romance."", ""The owner's daughter dating the team's coach? And not just any owner: only one of the most powerful owners of all time, Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss. And not just any coach: only the most successful NBA coach of all time."", ""Then there were hurdles, such as Jeanie Buss being the team's vice president in charge of business affairs at the time, and her brother Jim Buss being in charge of basketball operations."", 'So many tangled webs, and yet Jeanie Buss and Jackson somehow made it work for 17 years.', ""During the best of times, when the Lakers were winning NBA championships, they'd ride to the arena together from their house in Marina Del Rey. At games, Jeanie would sit with her girlfriends Linda Rambis and Stacy Kennedy in the second row, across the court from the Lakers bench, where Phil could see her and the players could hear her."", 'Once on the drive in, Jackson mentioned Lamar Odom needed a little extra encouragement as he adjusted to his new role as a sixth man. So during the game, Buss and her girlfriends made a point of cheering for Odom as he checked into the game. ""Take your pants off!"" they yelled out, as Odom shed his warm-ups near the scorers\' table. He beamed at the attention.', ""It was a small thing, but it was those kind of gestures that made the impossible relationship work for so many years. The way they'd work in tandem and share thoughts about the team with each other. That was Camelot."", ""Once Jackson retired as coach in 2011, things started changing. At first he was home all the time, plotting his next moves. He had no intention of coaching again -- his body couldn't take it. And his spirit was leading him in other directions, toward a front-office career, which would allow him to test his principles from on high, way above the court."", ""But when Dr. Buss was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012, and the franchise needed a coach of some stature to come in and lead the team of superstars -- Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard and Steve Nash -- for what appeared to be Dr. Buss' last ride, Jackson raised his hand."", 'As always, he would do it for Jeanie.', ""This time, the Lakers didn't call on him. Or rather, general manager Mitch Kupchak called him around midnight to tell him the Lakers had chosen to hire Mike D'Antoni instead."", ""Jackson was livid. His agents issued a blistering statement, decrying the disrespect shown to the coach who had won five titles for L.A. and was willing to come out of retirement to coach the team and help his fiancee's family at a critical juncture."", 'It did not break apart their relationship though. If anything, it strengthened it. About six weeks later, Jackson proposed to Jeanie Buss. His knees and hips were too stiff to get down on one knee. Not that he is the grand gesture type, anyway. What was important is that he knew getting engaged would make her happy, and give her father some peace as he lay dying.', 'The engagement was almost destined to stay at that level once Jackson became president of the Knicks in 2014. Jackson and Buss had to sign documents that ensured there would be no conflicts of interest between the two franchises. According to sources, that included a provision that the NBA and its owners be informed if they ever decided to marry.', ""So now not only were they living apart, they couldn't talk about their jobs when they were together.

Dirk Nowitzki, 38, hopes his body will let him play at least one more.

Robert ""Tractor"" Traylor was selected by the Dallas Mavericks at No. 6 and swapped for a floppy-haired German kid a few picks later in a deal with the Milwaukee Bucks.

I actually worked out with Holger [Geschwindner, Nowitzki's shooting coach] those couple of days, and I stayed at Holger's house. We couldn't watch it anywhere. It wasn't on TV back in Germany. I remember in the middle of the night, we got a call and it was [then-Mavericks coach] Don Nelson. He was like, 'Hey, we just drafted you guys. We'd love to come over and see you guys,' because I had said that I wasn't sure if I was coming [to the NBA] or not."", ""I was like, 'This is crazy!' After the whole Hoop Summit, I guess there was a little hype, but I never thought somebody would take a chance on me that high, especially after saying that I wasn't sure if I would come or not, worried about basically going from the second division to the NBA. That was a huge jump, and I was a little worried. It was bizarre. 'Whoa, Dallas took a chance on me at frickin' No. 9?' It was incredible."", ""Then [Mavericks GM Donnie Nelson] and Nellie came maybe a couple of days later. They showed up in Wurzburg. [Then-Mavericks owner] Ross Perot came in the private plane. I had this press conference in this small little hotel that I'll never forget. It was unbelievable. I remember like maybe two or three media people showed up, because it was on such short notice, right? Ross was the one who wanted the press conference, but we couldn't even get a TV station there. There was literally like three people there. It was so bizarre, so bizarre."", '""\'Whoa, Dallas took a chance on me at frickin\' No. 9?\' It was incredible.""', 'Dirk Nowitzki, on his reaction to being drafted by the Mavs in 1998', ""Then Ross flew out again, and Donnie and Nellie stayed for a few days and talked to me over and over. They said, 'Hey, don't make a decision before we fly you to Dallas. We want you to see everything and meet some of the guys.' So I agreed to that. I flew back with Donnie and Holger, stayed at Nellie's house back in the day. Had a press conference. Never had a suit, so I remember right from the airport, we went right to Lombardo's [Custom Apparel in Dallas]. I had the worst jacket on, and we had a press conference."", ""That's when I met Nashie [Steve Nash] for the first time, because they flew him in for the press conference. It kind of clicked from there. I think on my second night, Nellie threw a little barbecue at his house for me, and Fin [Michael Finley] came and Strick [Erick Strickland] came. Nashie was there and some of the other guys who were in town. I just got to mingle a little bit and meet them and speak as much as I could with my English."", ""Then the next night was our decision. They set a press conference the morning before I left, and Nellie was like, 'Think about it all night, but we need a decision before you leave.' So that night was rough. I remember I was sitting with Holger around the pool for hours. Obviously, I had concerns. I had concerns about making that huge jump. I'd never lived anywhere but with my parents. I guess the end of the story was, 'We'll try.' They had a young team. It wasn't like they were a great team right [then], not really a playoff team, so you could get some minutes and develop."", ""Nellie said, 'At the end of the day, if things don't work out, you could always go back to Europe.' That's always an option after two or three years [when] your contract is over. If they don't take the option after three years, you're back home in Europe. So the next day, I went to the press conference and was like, 'I'll try.'"", 'Pierce: I remember slipping and not really knowing where I was going to end up. Because I only worked out for the top five teams.', ""I remember I didn't know who Jason Williams was, and he got drafted ahead of me. It was just weird.

But you know, things happen for a reason. I guess it was meant for me to be in Boston. It worked out OK."", ""Carter: You finally get to the draft after working out for five or six teams, and it's the unexpected. We knew either Bibby or Olowokandi was going one or two, and then after that, it's all hearsay. I heard anywhere from three to eight. That's what I hear, so you kind of have to hang your hat on that unless you get that phone call: 'OK, we're going to get you if you're available.'"", ""I just remember sitting around. Olowokandi, OK. Bibby, OK. Raef LaFrentz, great. From there, you really didn't know. I remember sitting at the table next to me was Antawn Jamison. Our families were sitting next to each other, laughing and talking. I remember saying, 'Man, what do you think is going to happen?' We had no idea."", ""They called Antawn at four. I mean, he was my suitemate in college and very good friends, so [I was] over the moon. It felt like I got drafted, because I was just nervous and excited for him, as if it was me. But the weird thing about it at the time was that he never worked out for Toronto. So it was kind of like, 'OK, well, they just really wanted him.' I worked out for them, and Toronto told me basically, 'If you're available, we're going to go get you, so you might as well come work out.' That's what we were hearing, so I took my workout and everything."", '""I was introduced to the business of basketball pretty much in the first five minutes. I was on the West Coast back to the East Coast in a matter of five minutes.""', 'Vince Carter, on being traded from Golden State to Toronto on draft night', ""But then, they drafted him, so I was just perplexed a little bit, like, 'Wait a minute, what the heck's going on here?' But nevertheless, I was excited for him and like, 'Whatever.' You know, you're just living in the moment."", ""Then I started looking around. When the camera starts getting close to you, you figure they're talking about you. 'This could be it.' You try to play it cool. Then I get the phone call like right before and they call your name, and it was just over the moon."", 'I remember getting my hat from [""hat lady""] Chrysa Chin, and then I\'m walking up the steps and as I\'m walking, I see Antawn at the bottom of the steps still. I was like, \'Hey, what\'s up?\' As soon as I took the picture, David Stern says to me, \'Wait right here, there\'s about to be a trade. We\'ll go from there.\'', ""OK, I step back. I'm holding my hat, looking at it. The first thing I said is, 'Dang, somebody's getting traded already on draft night.' Dang it, it was me, and it all came together. Well, Antawn I guess got the word that there was going to be a trade. That's why he was sitting there. I didn't know, because of course, by the time it was happening I was already walking up to the stage. It blindsides me, pretty much. But then it all made sense."", ""I was introduced to the business of basketball pretty much in the first five minutes. I was on the West Coast back to the East Coast in a matter of five minutes. Mind you, everybody [at their tables] had their hat fixed perfectly. Basically, here's your hat to that table, here's your hat to this table. It was a pretty cool thing. Not only did [Jamison and I] get to experience the draft beside each other, but we got traded for each other as well, so it was pretty cool."", ""Nowitzki: Vince just had unbelievable athleticism. I mean, he did stuff that I don't think we've seen before in this league. I was in Oakland at his dunk contest in [2000], and nobody's ever seen the stuff that he did."", ""But what kept him so long in the league now was really his skill level, even though obviously he still has some athleticism, still has some hops. But it's his shot, the repertoire of fadeaways that he's got, his 3-ball was always money and he's a big guy for a 2 or 3 that was always good on the block. He'd run a pick-and-roll going to his right, where he was always deadly."", ""I mean, he was a tough matchup because he could post, and he was so freakishly athletic. He'd come off a down pick and just jump up and really nobody could get to his shot. Obviously, he's so athletic that once he got going to the rim, you could challenge him, but he was going to put you on a poster. He was fun to watch during his prime."", ""Pierce: He had unique ability, something you hardly see: great athleticism and great shooting touch. Usually you see one without the other. He had the combination of both. That's rare. It's something this league has not seen in a long time."", 'Pierce: Dirk changed the game, man. When you look at what he was able to bring with his versatility and his shooting as a 7-footer, to be able to put the ball on the ground, he was one of the first stretch 4s that you see more of today. I mean, he revolutionized the game.', 'Players like that are transcendent. He was a transcendent player.', ""Carter: First of all, his work ethic. He puts a lot of time in, and it's different than any other player I've ever seen. I've been around long enough to see a lot of guys train and prepare, but he just loves the game. He loves to play. He loves to compete. And he's selfless. He's all about the good of the team."", ""That's one thing, having the opportunity to play with a go-to guy, a superstar like himself, is that he's willing to make the right play. It's not always like, 'The play is for me; I have to make the shot.' 'The play is for me; I have to make the right play,' that's his mentality. But when he wants the ball, he's going to say, 'Give me the ball.'"", ""He's a professional scorer. I say this about myself, too, and you could probably say it about Paul as well: When you see him walk into the arena before a game, you could probably say there's no way in hell that those guys are playing tonight. Then Dirk will come in and drop 35. Regardless of how he feels before the game, once the big lights are on and you come on the court, he knows how to get it done, plain and simple."", ""Nowitzki: He was strong. He'd get to his spots. He was a clutch shooter. He definitely had the clutch gene. Great pump fake, could get to the foul line. I mean, he was the complete package from the small forward standpoint. You put a smaller guy on him, he was able to post and shoot over him. Could drive both ways, even ran some pick-and-rolls."", ""And when it mattered, he made big shots. I wouldn't say he was a great flat-out 3-point shooter, but when the game was on the line, you never really wanted him shooting the 3. He was a competitor and really just a great all-around player."", ""Carter: He was a killer. He's been like that since high school. I remember us playing against each other in the McDonald's [All-American Game] and just being around each other. He's always had the mentality to score and wanted to dominate while having the ability to do whatever he wanted."", ""He had the big body and he knew how to use it. There are some people who are big and strong, but they don't use it like that. Paul used it. And he was deceptively quick, so when he got the ball in the logo area and he would swing through and put his body on you, you just hope he missed."", ""I've had many, many, many great battles against him and know him very well. Of course, we all know Paul can shoot the heck out of the basketball from the 3-point line. He's just another professional scorer."", ""Nowitzki: I was always the young guy, the German wunderkind, the young guy coming up with talent. It felt like the next thing you know, I was 30. Those years just flew by. You're having fun, you're competing every year, and then in the summer, it's not like I was just sitting on my butt in my 20s. I played national team every year, so literally I took like two weeks off and then was right back in the gym working with Holger. If you stay busy, time flies. So my 20s, I felt like they were over in a heartbeat."", ""Next thing you know, you're 30 and you're sort of like a mid-aged guy. Couple of young guys, but still a couple older guys. Then the last few years, you're just the oldest guy. It's amazing how 19 years just have flown by. But if you stay busy, if you have a blast ..."", ""Now, I'm still trying to compete. I enjoy doing it. Obviously, it's not as easy as back in the day. All the extra work you have to put in to stay ready. Now dealing with injuries that I really never had, it takes the fun away a little bit, but hopefully I can [stay healthy] and have fun."", ""Pierce: Oh, it's fun. I'm enjoying every moment. Shootaround, I'm enjoying. The bus rides, the plane rides with the guys, I'm enjoying every last bit of camaraderie that I'm going to get with my team."", ""In the locker room, on the court, I'm just soaking it all in. I've been around this game for a long time -- a lot of plane rides, a lot of bus rides, a lot of pregame speeches, a lot of national anthems. I'm enjoying the ride, man."", ""I know this is the last year, so I'm enjoying it as much as I can."", ""Carter: I'm a little uneasy sometimes. Some days, I'm OK with it. I know it's near, and I'm preparing myself for it. But some days, I'm like, 'Man, I'm not ready to walk away from it,' because I still enjoy being in the gym. I still enjoy running around and competing and laughing and joking. There's nothing better when you've done this so long. It's all you know. Maybe not all I know, but all I've done and all I've enjoyed doing at this point."", ""Now, I'm prepared to move on to Phase 2. But it's kind of like, you do all the preparation to be prepared, but you're not prepared, if that makes sense. I remember seeing all of the other guys [with the Raptors], seeing Oak [Charles Oakley] and Antonio [Davis] and Kevin Willis and [Hakeem] Olajuwon, watching them in their final years. Then they stepped out in the world and were just kind of like, 'Where do I go from here?' I mean, those guys were prepared."", ""It's something I never really thought about until -- I'm going to say five years ago: just making sure I'm ready. Because you hear the stories about guys who step out into the world when they retire, and it's like, 'All right, I have some money in my pocket. Where do I go?' Then just spending and spending, and you hear the next horror story that they go broke. That's something that I vow never to do."", ""For me, an idle mind is just awful. I think I'd be a miserable person, and I'd get on a lot of people's nerves if I'm retired and I have nothing to do. I can't just sit around. People are like, 'Oh, you get to retire and go to all these countries and visit.' I can't do that. That's not who I am. I'm not a vacation guy like that. I wouldn't like it. I know that, so I'd have to find something to do. That's where Phase 2 started years ago as far as kind of introducing myself to different people and figuring out what I'm really passionate about."", ""The coaching thing is still up in the air. I get asked about it all the time. I enjoy it, but I don't know if I want to do it. It's just the weirdest thing. I guess it makes sense, but to me, it still doesn't make sense. How is it that you enjoy it, have been doing it all these years but can see yourself [coaching full time]? I really can't see myself as a coach as of right now. In the broadcasting world, I can see it clear as day. I'm still fighting with that."", ""Other than that, I'm ready to go when the time is [right]. There's some mornings I wake up and it's like, 'Is it one more year? Or is it this year? Or is it three years?' I can never decide on a number. Scary. It really is for me, because I love this game, and I don't want to leave it. Not yet."", ""Nowitzki: [Heavy sigh.] That sounds like a lot. But you know, hopefully I can [stay] out there and I can score a few. Vince has been on a tear for a while, and Paul I don't think is playing much, but you know we're going to try. All three of us are competitors. I think as you get older, it's more important to be on a winning team. I'm sure Vince is enjoying that [the Grizzlies] are playing well, and Paul is enjoying the Clippers. We need some work."", ""Pierce: It's going to be tough. It's not looking good. I'm not playing much. Our only chance is Vince Carter now. Dirk has been hurt. But who knows? Man, we've got a shot. We've got a shot. But I think LeBron [James], [Dwyane] Wade and [Carmelo Anthony] are going to crush it. LeBron, Wade and Melo are coming. And they're coming fast."", ""Carter: It's possible. It's possible. I mean, God willing with health, of course, and opportunity. I think it's possible if we stay healthy. Dirk wants to play another year, and with his ability to score, he's going to get touches. I'm putting all of the pressure on him.""]","The twilight tales of Vince Carter, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce","The last holdovers from the Class of '98 discuss draft-night stories, plans for life after basketball and where they rank among the best draft trios in NBA history.","NBA, Dirk Nowitzki, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, 1998 draft, 1998-99, NBA, Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, LA Clippers",,,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': None, 'spoilerPublisher': None}","['Vince Carter', 'Paul Pierce', 'Dirk Nowitzki']","[[[0, 24], [0, 36]], [[1, 0], [1, 11]], [[1, 53], [1, 66]]]",['multi']

Get ready turn down that water temperature and drop the shampoo. Here are the things you need to stop doing while showering.', 'Showering is—and should be—a daily habit for most of us, and everyone has their own routine. Some people can’t live without washing their hair each day while others chose to skip a day or two, and the differences continue on from there.', 'However, did you know that some of the most common shower habits might not actually be that healthy? Believe it or not, some of the things you do every day while taking a shower could be affecting you in ways you’ve never thought of.', 'Check out this list to see if your shower habits are doing you more harm than good.', '1. Washing Your Face', 'Without a doubt, it’s easier and less messy to wash your face when you’re already in the shower. However, despite the convenience, it’s actually not good for your face. The water that you shower in will typically be much hotter than what you’d wash with at the sink, and the high temperature can make your skin dry out very quickly.', 'Those with skin conditions such as acne or rosacea may also find that washing their face with hot water can cause excessive redness and irritation—it could even burst a blood vessel in your face if you wash too aggressively. Use a gentle cleanser and avoid washing your face in the shower, particularly if you have acne-prone skin or rosacea.', '2. Not Washing Your Feet', 'You might be thinking that your feet make contact with plenty of water while you’re in the shower, so there’s no real reason to actually bend down and give them a proper wash. You’d be wrong, though.', 'Even if you’re not prone to smelly feet, think about how sweaty your feet can get throughout the day. Not only that, but if you’re known to walk around the house or outdoors without socks or shoes, you never know what you might be picking up along the way.', 'There’s no excuse for just letting the soap suds run down to your toes anymore—imagine what you’re bringing into your bed every night without giving those feet a good wash.', '3. Not Washing or Replacing Your Loofah Regularly', 'Be honest, how long has the same loofah been hanging in your shower? Months? YEARS? As it turns out, that can be terrible for your health. This video demonstrates why:', 'Consider treating yourself to a new sponge or loofah the next time you’re out, or create a cute and convenient place to hang the one you have for air drying.', '4. Using a Soap Dish', 'Yes, that built-in soap dish is there forever, but using it for its intended purpose actually isn’t that good of an idea. The majority of people don’t use bars of soap these days but, for those who do, be aware that leaving a bar of soap in one spot could be encouraging bacteria to grow on it—bacteria that you’re then going to spread over your entire body the next time you lather up.', 'If you have reasons for resisting the switch to liquid body wash, try finding a wire soap dish or one that has holes in the bottom so any remaining water can drain away once you’re out of the shower.', '5. Using Scented Soaps', 'Yes, those soaps that make your bathroom smell like a tropical rainforest or a freshly-made vanilla cupcake do transport you to a place of olfactory luxury while sudsing up, but those very fragrances could be doing a number on your skin at the same time.', 'Anyone who notices their skin seems particularly irritated after a shower should look to their soap as the first culprit. Fragrances can irritate sensitive skin very easily, so it’s best to use something unscented to keep your skin in the best shape. Plus, you won’t have to worry about the scent of your soap mixing with the scent of your perfume to create ""questionable"" smells.', '6. Showering in Hard Water', 'Some people may not even know how to tell if their water is considered hard, but figuring it out and taking steps to adjust it could save your hair and skin from a lot of damage.', 'Hard water is defined by its high concentration of minerals like magnesium and calcium, which can end up making your skin break out or cause a layer of buildup on your hair. Those with dyed hair may even find that hard water strips the color out of their strands, or at least causes their tint to fade a little quicker.', 'If you’re unable to add a water softener to your shower, try incorporating a clarifying shampoo into your routine to remove any buildup caused by those pesky minerals.', '7. Avoiding Cold Showers', 'Most people wouldn’t even dream of standing in cold water for more than a second, let alone taking an entire shower in water that’s anything less than steaming hot.', 'Still, cold water showers can actually be really beneficial for your skin and hair, and you only need 30 seconds under a cold stream to see a difference. A quick blast of cold water is said to improve your immune function, increase your metabolism, and increase the amount of stress you can tolerate.', 'In addition to speeding up your metabolism, a study done in 2009 suggests that regularly taking a cold shower could even help you lose weight over time.', '8. Using Old Razors', 'For most of us, old razors aren’t something we thoughtfully replace on a regular basis. Instead, they just sit in the shower until we finally cave and get a new one. Razors, whether you’re buying replacement heads or the kind that are entirely disposable, are surprisingly expensive—so why throw one out after a certain period of time if it still seems to work?', 'Well, just because a razor is shaving off your unwanted hairs doesn’t mean it’s doing so effectively. If you notice that your skin gets red and inflamed after you shave, it’s because the blades are dull and it’s time for a replacement.', '9. Leaving Your Razor in the Shower', 'Remember how leaving your wet bar of soap in your dingy old soap dish makes it a breeding ground for bacteria? The same thing goes for your razor. There are plenty of nooks and crannies in your razor that make perfect spots for bacteria to hide, and the problem will only get worse when the razor is sitting in a warm, wet environment.', 'If you don’t actually want to store your razor outside of the shower, at least make sure that you hang it up when you’re done using it so it can air dry.', '10. Over Exfoliating', 'Giving your skin a gentle scrub every now and then is a good idea, but doing so every day could actually be causing damage. For anyone who doesn’t know, your skin actually exfoliates itself by renewing every 27 days or so.', ""Anyone who chooses to exfoliate their skin every day is aggressively going after fresh skin cells, which can make your skin red and irritated as a result. It’s best to let some dead cells build up on the surface of your skin before reaching for your favorite scrub so that, you know, there’s actually something there worth exfoliating.'""]",These Are The Shower Habits That You Need To Ditch,"Everyone showers, but not everyone showers the right way.

81a656d7-8817-4f16-94dc-3bacf5081d42,4z1oa2,ex-cons remember their worst jobs after being released from prison,reddit,"['Getting a job when you first get out of prison can be a nightmare . Most employers refuse to hire someone fresh out the feds or convicts who are still incarcerated but allowed to get a job through ""work-release."" Other prisoners are so shell-shocked from being back in a society that changed dramatically while they were locked up, that figuring out how to do basic things like use public transportation or a cell phone can feel like a Herculean task. According to the National Institute of Justice , over 60 percent of ex-cons are jobless up to a year after release.', ""That said, getting a job is a necessary step for prisoners to integrate back into society. Often times, it's a requirement by the criminal justice system, or else freshly-released inmates will risk being sent back to the feds. But even when ex-cons do manage to get hired, the work is underpaid, demoralizing, and their employers don't do much to encourage the re-entry process. There are organizers that help former prisoners assimilate into the workforce, but the support is generally few and far between."", ""After serving 23 years in the feds, the first job I got on the outside was as a sauté cook at an Italian restaurant, despite my earning two college degrees while in prison. The work sucked, and I was forced to do the grunt work no one else would do, like clean out the fryers every night. I wasn't in any position to argue and risk being canned, and my employers took advantage of this. I dreaded that job, but as I've talked with other ex-cons over the years about their first gigs on the outside, I now consider myself lucky. The fact that over 75 percent of ex-cons are rearrested within five years of releas e should be no surprise when the only jobs offered to people with criminal records are the gigs no one else applies for. VICE chatted with three ex-cons to get more perspective on what re-entering the workforce was like once they got out of prison."", 'Image of cattle ranchers via Wikimedia Creative Commons', 'Mendoor Smith, 43-Year-Old from Iowa', 'Served 12 Years for Marijuana Possession', 'Released from Custody in 2013', ""The worst job I had was working on a cattle ranch as a utility farmer, making $8.25 an hour. I had to be there from about 6 AM to 5 PM every day, and the commute was 45 minutes from the halfway house I was placed in. It wasn't really tough work, but the handling of manure and animals was rough, as was taking care of the calves and cows. Dealing with cows everyday is messy, and I'd have to clean out their living pens."", ""I remember calving one shift during the winter, and when I did my hourly inspection of the herd, I noticed a cow with an extremely bad vaginal prolapse. I called my boss and he called the vet who came out at four in the morning. I had to lift the cow's vaginal insides and hold them while the vet tried to stuff them back inside the cow. After about an hour and a half of lifting and stuffing this slimy, nasty thing, the vet finally got it all back inside and sewed up. When I did my final inspection of the morning at 10 AM, the cow had died. All that work was for nothing. Having to stick my entire arm in a cow to help pull out a calf was not fun either. You work super hard to pull one of the slimy things out, and then you have to scoop the little thing up and take off before the cow attacks you for holding its calf. Having a 1,200 pound animal chase you is a little intimidating."", ""I had two coworkers that knew about my [criminal] situation. They asked a lot of questions, stuff about what was prison like and what I did to get all that time. My boss was a good boss. He helped me get my Class A driver's license so I could drive trucks for him. He was a big help and was instrumental in me getting the job I have now. The farm was a tight-knit family, so I was treated well, but the work was completely horrible. It prepared me for the struggle of rebuilding my life after prison, though. It didn't kill me and it made me stronger. That job sucked, but I was still glad to have it because I wouldn't be in the position I'm in today otherwise."", 'David Hibdon, 55-Year-Old from Missouri', 'Served 10 Years for Drug Conspiracy', 'Released from Custody in 2014', ""My first job out of prison was the worst job available in Colombia, Missouri. I was picking up trash at the city dump in 100-plus degree weather for $8 an hour. I had to walk around 27 acres and pick up the trash that blew off the trucks, rain or shine. Some days I walked through raw sewage, or mud up to my ankles. The halfway house didn't provide transportation to the job, and I had to walk there every morning. It was a seven mile walk that took over two hours. I had to be there at seven in the morning and got off at 4 PM, with only a short lunch break in between. With my first paycheck, I bought a bike and then it only took me forty minutes to get to work. I was making about 50 bucks a day, but I was required to give 25 percent to the halfway house. If I bought a soda or cigarettes I was almost broke. It took me two months in the halfway house to save up and buy a $500 car."", ""I worked there because it was the only job available. Nobody wanted the job because of the stink and the dust blowing on you from the trash trucks. No one else would take these jobs besides ex-cons at the halfway house. And all the other ex-cons that worked there would sleep on a nearby hill or smoke K2 all day while I was working. I was alienated out there. It was one of the most degrading experiences I ever went through, but I got past it. It sure didn't help me become a better person cause I was still the same after."", ""I've had four jobs since I've been out, and I never told anyone I was on parole until after I was hired, or they wouldn't have hired me. I eventually started my own business, subcontracting myself out to do maintenance on rental properties. I could go back to the dump if I wanted, but that job sucked."", 'Image of a telemarketing call center via', 'Mike Vargas, 44-Year-Old from Washington DC', 'Served 14 Years for a Drug Conspiracy', 'Released from Custody in 2009', ""It wasn't hard getting a job when I came home, it just wasn't a good job. I started working the same week I was released at this telemarketing place that hired ex-cons at $7.25 an hour. You had to be there talking to people on the phone all day, cold calling, trying to collect donations for different organizations around the state and country. It was cool at first, but after a while I was starting to feel like a robot."", ""I worked with mostly young people, and there were also a bunch of ex-cons working there. Anybody could have got hired at this place, but the conditions were terrible. You had a total of 16 minutes of break time for a full eight hour shift. If you went to get a Coke, you had to clock out. If you went to the bathroom, you had to clock out. If you didn't kiss ass, you were an outsider. There was a lot of favoritism, and also a big turnover within staff, of course."", ""Dudes would curse out the boss. One dude even jumped up, picked up a computer, and slammed it down because he couldn't get anybody to donate. He walked out shortly after. But most ex-cons needed the job to get out of the halfway house, so they just kept working there until something better came along. I quit that job when I had something better lined up. It served its purpose because if you don't have a gig you have to stay at the halfway. I've had like seven or eight jobs since then. I've done a lot of different things, but that was the worst. I'm a machinist now, and I assemble parts all day at a machine.

b3a4d283-5c79-4a2a-912d-3577b8cca6e9,51z2ru,5 reasons why no one has built a better epipen,reddit,"['oston mom Denise Clark has been buying EpiPens annually for the past 16 years, ever since her son was diagnosed with a serious peanut allergy. Problem is, he won’t carry his EpiPen around with him — because it won’t fit into his pocket.', '""It’s large and it’s impractical,"" Clark said. ""Where’s he going to put it?""', 'This underscores a simple truth: EpiPens just aren’t that great.', 'They’re reliable, sure. They’ll buy a patient who’s in the midst of a severe allergic reaction a few crucial minutes to make his way to the hospital.', 'But they’re also bulky. Their epinephrine solution isn’t particularly shelf-stable, and will easily degrade in temperatures that are too low or too high. They expire after about a year. And they’re not so user-friendly. Though EpiPens come with a practice kit, users in the midst of an allergy attack have mistaken which end’s the pointy end — and stabbed their thumbs instead of their thighs.', 'The devices have come under fire in the past month for their escalating sticker price: a pack of two EpiPens now lists for $608. Mylan, which owns the EpiPen brand (though the device itself is actually manufactured by Pfizer) notes that it redesigned the product in 2009, added features including the flip-top case, and is ""investing substantial amounts in research into additional improvements, such as a formulation with a longer shelf life.""', 'But critics say Mylan has little incentive to improve EpiPens: ""If you’re the monopolist, and you’ve got a product that expires every year, and it’s not super easy to carry around so the safest thing to do is have several tucked away in different places — I don’t see why there would be any pressure to innovate,"" said Nicholson Price, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School who studies health care regulation and patent law.', '""EpiPen’s flaws seem like features, not a bug,"" Price said.', 'Competitors have tried to make runs at the EpiPen. And more are trying now that there’s such a spotlight on the product. But it’s unclear if anything can displace the familiar auto-injector with the bright orange cap.', 'Here’s why:', '1. Mylan has patent protection that lasts through 2025', 'Epinephrine, as a drug, was first synthesized more than a century ago. It’s been used for various medical applications since then, and was first packaged in an auto-injector (to protect soldiers against chemical warfare) back in the 1970s.', 'But Mylan has a lock on the particular EpiPen design that millions of patients, parents, and school nurses have come to trust.', 'The company’s main innovation has been a bright orange cap that covers the needle, but releases automatically when a patient pushes an EpiPen against her thigh, so there’s no need to stop and unscrew the cover in the midst of an allergy attack.', 'The very fact that the EpiPen has been dominant for so long makes it hard for challengers to come in with a radically different design. (Mylan is now pledging to make a generic version, which it says will be identical except for the label.)', '""If you’re a parent, and your child’s suffering from an allergic reaction, you have to give them an injection — and don’t want to read the instructions in that moment,"" said Matthew Allen, head of drug delivery for Cambridge Consultants. ""You just have to know how to use it.""', 'Allen’s work at Cambridge Consultants centers around designing other forms of auto-injectors. He said the Food and Drug Administration has rules to standardize the way these life-saving devices work. Those rules keep consumers safe. But they also make it difficult to come up with design that can meet the standards — without infringing on Mylan’s patent.', '""It would not be very difficult to create an EpiPen product, in terms of engineering,"" Allen said. ""It’s not rocket science. It’s purely the patent that stops us.""', '2. There’s no room for error when you’re treating anaphylaxis', 'Chris Stepanian is CEO of Windgap Medical, a Boston startup that’s been working on a next-generation epinephrine auto-injector for the past five years.', 'Windgap’s device is meant to improve upon the EpiPen: It’s supposed to be smaller, about the size of a Bic lighter, with a much more stable formulation of epinephrine intended to survive in a pants pocket without getting overheated.', 'But that’s proving easier said than done. Stepanian said he’s at least a few years away from bringing his newfangled auto-injector to market.', 'Though EpiPen components look pretty basic, Mylan notes that it is made up of 26 parts and must be able to deliver the drug with a sterile needle within seconds. Stepanian agrees that it’s more complicated than it seems at first glance: ""It’s really challenging to make a reliable auto-injector — and surprisingly hard to make a combination drug product,"" he said.', '""It’s a tough thing to nail down the drug supply chain, the plastics and design, and then incorporate that all together, and put the drug inside it — and then regardless of how the user uses it, get the appropriate dose within the acceptable limits of the FDA,"" Stepanian added. ""At least Mylan and Pfizer have done a good job of making a pretty reliable one.""', 'One EpiPen alternative that did make it to market: The Auvi-Q, an epinephrine auto-injector shaped like a bulky credit card. But Sanofi recalled the devices last year over concerns that patients weren’t getting the correct dose every time. It returned the commercial and marketing rights to Kaleo, from whom it licensed the auto-injector in 2009. A representative from Kaleo said that it’s ""in the process of evaluating when and how"" to bring the Auvi-Q back to the market — but Sanofi is no longer involved.', '3. It doesn’t take an auto-injector to get epinephrine into the body — but it sure helps', 'In the wake of the recent outrage at Mylan, Los Angeles-based MannKind Corporation announced it’s developing an inhalable form of epinephrine.', '""We could make something very tiny, that you could carry on a keychain — much smaller than an EpiPen or auto-injector by far,"" MannKind CEO Matthew Pfeffer said.', 'MannKind already has an inhalable insulin product, called Afrezza, on the market, which gives diabetics an alternative to injections. But it’s proved exceedingly tough to get patients to switch from a format of insulin intake they’re familiar with to an inhaler. Sales have been far below expectations.', 'The same problem could stymie an epinephrine inhaler, especially since one of the frightening features of an anaphylactic attack is that the airways constrict — which, in theory anyway, could make it hard for a patient to use the inhaler in a moment of crisis.', '4. The regulatory process is slow and expensive', 'A lot of the challenge lies in the regulatory system, said Mark Baum, CEO of San Diego-based Imprimis — a compound pharmaceutical company that’s working on a cheaper alternative to the EpiPen. It can take a long time, and a lot of money, to get FDA approval for a new product.', '""The only time it makes economic sense to take the risk of going through these clinical trials is when you have a situation like this,"" Baum said. ""But when the market was more normalized — when the EpiPen was only retailing around $100 — competitors questioned whether it was worth taking that risk.""', 'Public anger at EpiPen is so high right now that Baum figures it is worth taking the risk. Imprimis has had its eyes on the epinephrine auto-injector market for about two years now; it’s finally going to go for it.', '""We’re just focused on being that competition,"" he said.', '5. The public hasn’t spoken (loud enough)', 'Denise Clark, whose son has that peanut allergy, is a consultant with Boston MedTech Advisors. She helps medical device companies with design, market analysis, and regulatory strategy.', 'But though she works in the field every day, she says she never even thought much about the flaws of the EpiPen design — or the lack of innovation — until the product started hitting headlines.', '""It’s something that’s always been irritating to me, but not to the point that I’ve looked at it closely — until I had to start paying all this money,"" Clark said.', 'Granted, the Federal Trade Commission has been fielding complaints about Mylan’s pricing for years, and complaints about the device’s clunkiness are no secret. But since the EpiPen is generally covered by insurance, many customers have simply gone with it. That means there’s been little pressure from the paying public for innovation.', '""I guess Mylan’s motto is, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,’"" Clark said. ""They have such a monopoly, so why would they bother improving the EpiPen?""']",5 reasons why no one has built a better EpiPen,EpiPens aren't that great.

In 2016, it seems that there is still work to do, although great gains have been made in recent years. More and more states in America are legalizing same-sex marriage and are opening their doors, hearts, and minds to same-sex couples. Still, it is difficult for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals to be taken seriously or treated with respect in some places. There are still people out there who turn these individuals away from their homes and businesses, but with the help of organizations and groups that promote acceptance and tolerance, circumstances can shift.', 'We are going to name 15 LGBTQ Celebrities You Didn’t Know Came Out in 2016, so that you can see just how many celebs are taking a stand for this community. You may know of some actors, musicians, and authors who have come out as gay (think Wanda Sykes and Zachary Quinto), but there may be other famous people you didn’t know identify as bisexual, lesbian, gay, or somewhere else on the spectrum. So take in this information and you will see just how many people belong to and feel connected to this community.', ""We should point out that there are also some celebs who have been rumored to be gay or lesbian or something else, but the gossip is false, and they wont appear below. One example is singer Selena Gomez. While she doesn’t identify as an LGBTQ individual, she is still happy that she's able to be a positive role model. Are there any names on this list that really surprised you? Feel free to share the list on social media!"", '15 Kristen Stewart', 'Actress Kristen Stewart was the other half to actor Robert Pattinson for years, and the two were a discrete power couple in Hollywood in the past. Yet in early 2016, Stewart came totally forward and proclaimed her sexuality for all to hear and see. The 26-year-old is now in a romantic relationship with her personal assistant Alicia Cargile, and before that, Stewart was dating Soko, French actress and musician. Just two years ago, Stewart was ending her long-standing relationship with Pattinson, and before that, she was dating another one of her co-stars, Michael Angarano. Stewart and Cargile have only been dating since July of 2016, but Stewart has expressed that she is very happy with their relationship. As for Cargile, she may be a bit more rampant with her sexuality, as she was seen donning a baseball cap that said ""Make America Gay Again."" It was obviously a direct hit to Presidential candidate, Donald Trump.', '14 Aubrey Plaza', 'Who didn’t love watching Aubrey Plaza play Andy’s (Chris Pratt’s) girlfriend April on Parks and Recreation? Plaza plays the perfect cynical Debbie Downer character, but the 32-year-old actress’ unique and distinguishable character traits aren’t the only thing that makes her special. Plaza revealed earlier in 2016 that gender ""isn’t a factor"" for her when it comes to dating and romantic relationships. The actress is perfectly fine getting with someone whether they are a girl, guy, or don’t identify as either. Plaza’s revelation came during an interview with The Advocate, one of the most influential gay news magazines. Plaza did not call herself a bisexual, but she did say that she has a very ""androgynous and masculine"" aura about her, and that tends to attract many different kinds of people, which she is totally cool with. She then blatantly stated that she falls in love ""with girls and guys,"" and that she can’t help it.', '13 Mara Wilson', 'Sometimes it takes a tragedy for people to open up about their own struggles. So it was with Mara Wilson, the 28-year-old actress who starred in hit films such as Matilda and Miracle on 34th Street. Wilson was so deeply moved after the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that she Tweeted her emotions and truth for her fans. Wilson wrote ""F*cking hell, Orlando."" She then referred to a picture of herself ten years ago at a gay nightclub and added the caption: ""I have never had a better experience at a club than I did then...the LGBT community has always felt like home, especially a few years later when I, uh, learned something about myself."" Wilson then pointed out the Kinsey scale, which some people use as a measurement of one’s sexuality, from 100% straight to 100% homosexual. Wilson stated that she was a 2, meaning that she identifies as a queer and a bisexual.', '12 Colton Haynes', 'Actor Colton Haynes started 2016 by unloading a heavy burden about his sexuality. The 27-year-old actor is best known for his role on the MTV series Teen Wolf, and he chose a subtle way to break the news about his sexual orientation. Taking to social media, Haynes commented on a Tumblr post that someone wrote which explained how they were shocked to hear about Haynes’ ""secret gay past,"" and that it got them ""so excited."" Haynes then responded to the Tumblr post, writing ""Was it a secret? Let’s all just enjoy life & have no regrets."" Many people have assumed that this was Haynes’ way to publicly coming out as gay, even though he didn’t say he was gay directly. It is safe to say that he took a nonchalant approach and that he no longer has to worry about his sexuality being a secret. He certainly made the Tumblr world happy!', '11 Reid Ewing', 'If the name Reid Ewing sounds familiar, that’s because he is one of the famed actors from the hit TV series Modern Family. Ewing plays the role of Dylan, who is a recurring secondary character in the show, which is no stranger to exploring societal norms and challenges, such as same-sex relationships. The 27-year-old actor stepped forward earlier this year to share some serious information about himself. When writing on a guest blog post for HuffPost Healthy Living, Ewing wrote about his struggles with body dysmorphia before taking to Twitter to tell everyone in the chillest way possible that he is gay. His tweet read: ""Saw Eugene Bata on @GMA in the Body Dysmorphia segment connected to my article I just want to say he is hot af."" Someone commented and asked ""Did you just out yourself?"" to which Ewing replied ""I was never in."" *Drops mic* That’s the way to do it!', '10 Shane Dawson', 'For years, YouTube sensation and funny guy Shane Dawson was suspected of being gay. He would often perform hilarious skits in which he would play flamboyant characters or feisty females. Plus, with his cute emo haircut and his higher-pitched voice, he set off plenty of people’s gaydar. A few months ago, Dawson released a YouTube video on his channel simply titled ""I’m Bisexual."" In the video, Dawson told his 6 million followers that he had been struggling with his sexual identity for years, and that he wasn’t sure whether he was straight or gay or somewhere in between. He hoped that by releasing his video for his fans, others would realize that they’re not alone in their struggles with sexuality. Stating that, ""I don’t know who I am 100 percent. And I know that a lot of you guys might feel the same way,"" Dawson preferred to call himself a bisexual.', '9 Ryan Beatty', 'Another celeb who came out in 2016 was singer Ryan Beatty. The 20-year-old became famous thanks to his stellar YouTube videos that showed off his vocal talent and charming good looks. Beatty then began to break out into the public sphere and could be one of the next great male solo artists. A few months ago, Beatty used social media (fittingly enough, since that’s where he achieved fame) to tell his fans that he was gay. His Instagram post included the words ""raging homosexual"" and ""gay power."" Beatty stated that it took him two decades to come to terms with his sexuality, but now he is ""comfortable enough to say it"" and ""can finally breathe."" The singer also took to the Twitterverse and Tweeted: ""i’m so happy i’m gay"" and he also thanked his friends and family for their support. The announcement came right before the release of his single, ""Passion.""', '8 Rayvon Owen', 'Some of you may remember Rayvon Owen from American Idol’s 14th season, on which he was the third runner-up. The 24-year-old singer was nearly guaranteed success in the music world after his American Idol performances, but people were not expecting the star to come out, especially in the way that he did. Owen released a music video for his song ""Can’t Fight It"" earlier this year, and in this video, he explores the concept of his sexuality and how he had to come to terms with it. In ""Can’t Fight It,"" Owen can be seen going through a nightclub, and the sexy vibe lets us know that something’s up. By the end of the music video, Owen has found a guy that suits his fancy. He takes the man’s hand, kisses him, and thus reveals that he is now an openly gay singer. Plus, the other guy in the video was played by Shane Bitney Crone, a pivotal advocate and public figure in the LGBTQ community.', '7 Gloria Vanderbilt', 'Famed and respected news journalist for CNN, Anderson Cooper, has been out as a gay man since 2012, but earlier this year he was thrown for a loop when his own mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, dropped some bombshell information. Vanderbilt spoke during a joint interview alongside Cooper and revealed that when she was a teenager, she had a lesbian relationship with one of her classmates. It was a piece of information that had been unknown to Cooper for his entire life, and the way the journalist reacted was downright adorable, as he shrugged his shoulders at his mom and said, ""What? This is news to me."" Mother and son shared a cute giggle together and Cooper seemed grateful to know that his own mother had experimented with her sexuality. The whole thing was quite touching, and in fact, Vanderbilt wrote a book with her son which was recently published entitled The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son On Life, Love, and Loss.', '6 Nur Warsame', ""Nur Warsame is an imam in Australia, and for those of you who don’t know an imam is an Islamic worship or mosque leader in the Muslim faith. Warsame came out at the start of the summer in 2016 and became the first imam in Australia to openly identify as gay. Naturally, Warsame has dealt with an outpouring or both support and hate. There have been a number of mosques in Australia that will not accept Warsame through its doors, while other Muslim leaders have spoken out against Warsame and said that his acceptance of his sexuality is wrong. On the other hand, there have been other leaders and people in the public who have commended Warsame for his actions. Warsame was previously married to a woman and he also has a young daughter. He is now an advocate for other Muslims who may be struggling with their own sexuality.'""]",15 LGBTQ Celebrities You Didn’t Know Came Out In 2016,"The LGBTQ community is growing, both in terms of members who identify as LGBTQ or straight supporters who want to help the cause.

""Never-Before-Seen Photos Behind the Scenes at the Women’s March"" — Washington Post', 'While the exact long-term impact of the Women’s March in January remains to be seen, the event introduced ideas of what modern-day feminism looks like, in terms of scale, coverage and inclusivity. Kisha Bari’s images feel instantly iconic, and will undoubtedly be added to the catalog of feminist history for being one of the few photographers to cover the making of such a large-scale protest.', '—Kate Bubacz, senior photo editor, BuzzFeed News', '2. ""Honest Photos of Motherhood Challenge What We Think of as Natural"" — Huffington Post', 'In Leah DeVun’s exploration of motherhood, she focused on apparatuses that aid women in performing the very maternal act of nursing their offspring. The portraits are very direct. They don’t hold back in showing the viewer what it really takes to care for a child after birth. DeVun also shows that there’s nothing wrong or unnatural with using technology to help with breastfeeding.', '—Anna Mendoza, photo editor, BuzzFeed Australia', '3. ""This Is What International Women’s Day Looked Like Around The World"" — BuzzFeed News', 'On Wednesday, women across the world marked International Women’s Day by marching for various women’s rights, including health care, immigration, freedom from sexual violence, and equal pay. This roundup of images is testament to the incredible power of intercommunication in the digital age, when a woman on one side of the globe can raise her voice in unison with her sisters on the other. As these pictures convey, this year’s International Women’s Day was inspiring beyond belief.', '—Gabriel H. Sanchez, photo essay editor, BuzzFeed News', '4. ""A Crude Awakening"" — Time', 'Time should be applauded for taking a sweeping 360-degree look at the effects of the proposed Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines. Although the edit is concise, the scale and breadth of coverage is impressive, showing the impact that the oil industry has across Canada and the continental United States.', '—K.B.', '5. ""8 Portraits of Refugees That Will Help You Understand the Refugee Experience"" — BuzzFeed News', 'This portraits series is beautiful, and the faces only begin to hint at the poignancy of the subject’s stories.

""These Extremely Uncomfortable Photographs Are Guaranteed to Make You Squirm"" — Vice', 'A good photograph can evoke a strong visceral reaction from the viewer. In this collection of still lifes on Vice’s Creators, photographer Ambera Wellmann whimsically plays with these emotions by creating a photo project best described as uncomfortable. There’s something deeply troubling about these pictures, and while I can’t exactly put my thumb on it, the collection constitutes a great example of creativity in young photographers today.', '—G.H.S.', '7. ""Mozart in Nairobi’s Korogocho Slum"" — Al Jazeera', 'The most striking thing in this photo essay is how Eva de Vries placed the children with their instruments in the middle of the slum.

Here’s what they have in common', 'Every night for 20 years, Gino Rodriguez knelt beside his three daughters’ beds and whispered an incantation. As rats the size of footballs skittered along the floor of the basement apartment on the South Side of Chicago, he repeated the same five words into each girl’s ear as she slept: ""I can and I will."" The message was always the same, and the audience was always asleep.', '""You talk to the subconscious. You don’t talk to the conscious,"" Rodriguez says. ""That’s the one that really listens.""', 'The girls slept ""hot-dog style,"" cocooned in tightly wrapped sheets to keep out the vermin. They occasionally woke up during their father’s nightly pep talks, rolled their eyes and then went back to sleep. But each morning, they did a series of jumping jacks, looked in the mirror and said, ""Today is going to be a great day. I can and I will.""', 'Video by Diane Tsai for TIME', 'Not all days were great—the family moved from the rat-infested apartment only after a woman was murdered in front of their home. But the three daughters of Puerto Rican parents were kept safe, spending most of their time in school or at the boxing gym where their father refereed. They learned how to block a punch and throw a right hook. They bickered over clothes and went to dance class and dressed up for quinceañeras.', 'And one by one, they proved their father right: they could and they did. Ivelisse Rodriguez Simon graduated from Harvard Business School and is now a partner at a private-equity firm. Rebecca Rodriguez is the medical director of one of the best family-health clinics in the country. And Gina Rodriguez won a Best Actress Golden Globe for her starring role on Jane the Virgin.', '""We lived the idea of the American Dream,"" Gina says. ""And they made an environment where that was possible.""', 'The Rodriguez Family', 'Left and Right: Courtesy of the Rodriguez Family', 'This is a story about nine American families with children, like the Rodriguez kids, who all went on to extraordinary success in different fields. The Emanuel brothers conquered medicine, politics and Hollywood. The Wojcicki sisters became scientists, CEOs and tech entrepreneurs. The Simmons brothers are a painter, a rapper and a media mogul; the Antonoffs are now a rock star and a fashion designer. The Srinivasans include a judge, a public-health official and an entrepreneur, and the Gay siblings write books and run companies and design bridges. The Dungey sisters grew into an actor and a television executive. One Lin sibling designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; the other has written 12 books.', 'Each of these families is different in thousands of ways, from their ethnicities to their incomes to their sleepover policies. But we set out to find the ways they are the same.', 'In selecting candidates to study, we ignored siblings who do the same work in the same industry (like Venus and Serena Williams) and families that come from a great fortune or legacy (like the Trumps or the Kennedys). We looked for families in which all the siblings did well. And we defined success by leadership, service or achievement, not just fame or money alone. Of course, genetics plays a role for every family, but we focused on upbringing and sibling dynamics instead.', 'Some of the consistencies are fairly predictable. While none of these siblings grew up rich, they were privileged in many other ways. They had involved parents and lots of opportunities, and most saw college as achievable, even inevitable. They weren’t abused or neglected, and none grew up in abject want. They didn’t have an unfair head start, but they were spared some of the most difficult obstacles faced by less fortunate kids.', 'But other commonalities are more specific, and more telling. Of the nine families, eight had a parent who was an immigrant or an educator, and five had a parent who was both. Many parents were involved in political activism of some kind. Most recall a conflict-heavy family life, but that conflict was rarely between the parents. Many had a strong awareness of mortality as children. And most said they grew up with much more freedom than their friends did.', 'We talked to mayors and poets and judges and rappers, Jews from Chicago and Indians from Kansas and Haitians from Nebraska. We talked to siblings together and alone, and we talked to parents where we could. Here are six striking qualities they shared.', 'Immigrant Drive', 'As Gino Rodriguez was boxing with his daughters in Chicago, Saroja Srinivasan, a Hindu who is vegetarian, was mastering the art of the hamburger. She and her husband T.P. Srinivasan settled in Lawrence, Kans., with their three small children in the early 1970s, when T.P. joined the math department at the University of Kansas. Everyone they knew was back in India.', '""We made a conscious decision that we are different enough, so we should do everything we can to make [the kids] feel part of their community,"" Saroja recalls. That meant cooking hot dogs and pizza as well as dosas and pakoras, watching the Kansas Jayhawks in a living room adorned with Indian devotional art and arranging presents under the family shrine to celebrate ""Krishmas,"" their version of Christmas.', 'Just like their neighbors, the three Srinivasan children—Sri, Srija and \xadSrinija—played basketball and went shopping and rode dirt bikes. But they didn’t have chores in the same way their friends did. In the Srinivasan household, less was required—but more was expected.', 'There was no one person responsible for the trash or dishes. ""It was more like, ‘Look around. What’s Mom doing? Does she need help?’"" recalls Srinija, the youngest. ""Put things away. Pay attention.""', 'Also, nobody got an allowance. Instead, a drawer in the living-room table contained petty cash for anyone to use. ""On the one hand, it meant great permissiveness that is way better than an allowance,"" says Srinija. ""On the other hand, responsibility for every choice."" Her older sister Srija put it this way: ""If I took $20, that meant Sri and Srinija couldn’t go to the movies.""', 'The Srinivasan Family', 'Left and Right: Courtesy of the Srinivasan Family', 'The three kids, now adults, say they grew up understanding that the family was more important than the individual, a realization made especially poignant by the fact that their parents had left their own families behind to immigrate to the U.S.', 'For the Srinivasans, that sacrifice paid off. Sri would grow up to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit; his name was floated earlier this year as a candidate for the Supreme Court. Srija is the interim deputy chief for the San Mateo County health system, responsible for public-health efforts affecting more than 700,000 Californians. And Srinija is an entrepreneur who was one of the first employees at Yahoo and now sits on the board of Stanford University.', 'In addition to Puerto Rico and India, the parents of these extraordinary siblings arrived from Israel, Haiti, Poland and China. For their children, the standards were unstated yet fundamental, as invisible and necessary as oxygen.', 'The Gay siblings, a Haitian-American trio, grew up in Nebraska. Roxane Gay is a best-selling author and New York Times opinion writer, Joel Gay is one of the youngest black CEOs ever to helm a publicly traded company (Energy Recovery), and Michael Gay Jr. is a civil engineer. Their upbringing was stricter than their friends’: the kids weren’t allowed to have sleepovers, they couldn’t go to a friend’s home unless their mother Nicole had met the parents, and one bad grade could lead to the confiscation of beloved toys. None of that was up for discussion. ""Parenting is not a democracy,"" Nicole says.', 'The Gay Family', 'Left: Courtesy of the Gay Family; Right: Cindy Hegger Photography', 'Awareness of the im\xadmigrant experience, compounded by the fact that the Gays were often the only black family on their block, led to tough rules and high standards. ""Success and performance was not a choice. That was an expectation,"" Michael Gay Sr. says. ""Good grades in school, that was not something to make a big fit about."" No one received a gold star from ""General Gay and his attaché, Nicole,"" as Joel calls them.', 'Being from Haiti in particular meant that there was a distinct honor to uphold. ""They were very proud of our history, that we were the first black nation in the western hemisphere,"" says Roxane. Adds Joel: ""The more impoverished the country from whence you come, the more emboldened one’s work ethic is."" He says his parents, and the awareness of their sacrifice, created ""an extreme intolerance for underperformance within oneself.""', 'Parent-Teachers', 'On another university campus, far from the Srinivasans in Kansas, Esther Wojcicki was having a pool party. Her husband Stan was chair of the physics department at Stanford, and they regularly hosted barbecues for students and their families. Their daughters Susan, Janet and Anne would interrogate the guests about theoretical physics when they weren’t busy passing hors d’oeuvres or throwing each other in the pool.', 'Susan is now the CEO of YouTube, Janet is a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the Uni\xadversity of California, San Francisco, and Anne is a co-founder and the CEO of genetics company 23andMe. When they show up for breakfast in their childhood home on Stanford’s campus, each wears a shirt that belongs to one of the others. (""I just buy three of everything,"" says Anne, universally acknowledged as the best shopper of the bunch.) They immediately start mocking Anne for bringing her own kale to breakfast, mimicking Janet’s high school cheerleading routine (Anne knows it by heart) and passing around a video of Anne dancing in a hula skirt on a family vacation. ""When you have three girls together, it was already a party,"" Janet says.', 'Growing up surrounded by their dad’s physics buddies had its drawbacks. On their school vacations, the girls were usually dragged to physics conferences, where they would torment the world-\xadfamous scientists. They threw paper airplanes during presentations, hurled small objects off hotel balconies and even came up with an elaborate fashion-consulting prank to trick academics into changing their ugly ties.', 'But the academic environment also instilled a comfort with complex ideas and a confidence in asking questions. ""Because we grew up with a lot of strong academics, I think one of the skills we have is not being intimidated,"" says Susan. ""It’s never like, ‘Oh, this person is so important, I can’t challenge him.’""', 'The Wojcicki Family', 'Left: Courtesy of the Wojcicki Family; Right: Cody Pickens for TIME', 'Esther had begun her daughters’ ed\xaducation long before they were peppering Stanford physicists with questions about nuclear particles. After working as a teacher and playground supervisor in the 1960s, she began to suspect that early-childhood education was more crucial than anyone then thought. ""My theory was that the most important years were 0 to 5,"" she says. ""It was a gut feeling. So I made everything into a game."" She did arts and crafts projects with her toddler daughters, took them to the library every week and taught them how to read, count and swim before they even set foot in a classroom.', 'Of course, developmental experts have now proved Esther right: the first few years of a child’s life are among the most important for learning and brain development. And between Stan’s academic universe and Esther’s educational parenting, another commonality emerges: seven of the nine families had a parent who was a teacher.', 'Not all taught at the university level, though three families had at least one professor as a parent. The nine families also included parents who were elementary-school teachers, a preschool painting instructor, a doctor who taught medical students, a former French teacher and a school administrator who taught a night course on black history.', 'It may be that the job itself was less important than the educational mind-set. Parents in these families instinctively under\xadstood the importance of at-home instruction decades before researchers established the merits of early education. Their children recalled early supplementary lessons, books read aloud, regular \xadlibrary trips and even at-home worksheets to give them an early boost in school.', 'This clearly helped the Dungey sisters. ABC Entertainment Group president Channing Dungey is the first black president of a major television network, and her sister Merrin Dungey is a well-known actor, with major roles on Once Upon a Time and Alias. (She will appear on Conviction this fall.) Their mother had been an elementary-school teacher before Channing was born, and she applied her classroom skills to raising her two daughters in Sacramento. ""She would draw lines of faces, like three happy faces and one sad face, three triangles and one square, and then there’s my little crayon marks marking the one that was wrong,"" recalls Channing, who learned to read when she was 2 years old. ""We never went to preschool, because we didn’t have to,"" Merrin adds.', 'The Dungey Family', 'Left and Right: Courtesy of the Dungey Family', 'For the Srinivasans, having a parent who was an educator created an unspoken expectation of academic achievement that was almost as powerful as familial love. ""You probably have somewhere in the back of your mind that you don’t want to disappoint your teachers in the same way you don’t want to disappoint your parents,"" says Sri. ""There was just no other way to think.""', 'Political Activism', 'On most nights, the three Emanuel boys would adjourn their ritual fistfight and flop on their mother’s bed to hear a story. But sometimes she didn’t come home: Marsha Emanuel was occasionally arrested as she demonstrated against segregation in 1960s Chicago. On those nights, the boys bickered over the top bunk while Marsha waited behind bars.', 'The Emanuels would go on to become the stuff of legend and are often called the Jewish Kennedys: bioethicist Zeke is a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania, a former Obama Administration official and one of the main architects of the Affordable Care Act; Rahm is the mayor of Chicago and a former chief of staff to President Obama; and Ari created William Morris Endeavor, one of the biggest talent agencies in Hollywood.', 'Between their mother’s civil rights work, their pediatrician father’s campaign against lead paint and their grandfather’s union loyalties, the three rowdy youngsters couldn’t escape political awareness even if they tried. ""If we did not go with her to a particular protest, that protest was brought home,"" Rahm recalls, sitting in the briefing room of the Chicago mayor’s office. ""Just eating dinner was a test of current events."" (The brothers also have a much younger, adopted sister, Shoshana.)', 'Video by Diane Tsai for TIME', 'That political engagement created a sense that the world was malleable and that the boys, through their actions, could be the ones to shape it. ""You could, by protesting or coming up with ideas, actually change the world. I think that’s a very important message,"" says Zeke. ""It’s not that it will change necessarily, but the world can change, and that you have a responsibility to try to make a change.""', 'Political activism was a common theme for the parents in these families. Many of them were outspoken in their demands for reform in cities, schools and housing complexes, and never just for the benefit of their own children. While none of the parents held high political office, their involvement ranged from demonstrating for civil rights to union organizing to demanding that cities build new parks or that universities treat low-wage workers fairly. When they weren’t pushing for reform, they were mediating heated political debates at home.', 'The Emanuel Family', 'Left: Courtesy of the Emanuel Family; Right: Brooke Collins—City of Chicago', 'Daniel Simmons Sr. also found himself arrested during civil rights demonstrations. He worked as a New York City school-attendance superintendent by day and taught a college course on black history by night. His young sons remember waving goodbye as he boarded a bus from Queens to see Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington in 1963. They stood with him on picket lines and visited his class on radical politics, and they were watching when he lay down in front of a bulldozer to protest a segregated construction site. Now adults, they say their father’s activism showed them how to get involved in the world outside themselves.', '""He had his own moral compass. He knew what was right and what was fair, and he demanded that kind of justice,"" says Russell Simmons of his father. ""It stuck with me. It stuck by all my brothers as well. It’s part of our makeup.""', 'ControlLed Chaos', 'Another thing the Simmons brothers had in common with the Emanuels: they knew how to throw a punch. Growing up in heroin-ridden Hollis, Queens, in the 1970s, Danny and Russell once survived a street fight against 12 other guys. Occasionally, they’d bring the fighting home. ""One time Danny took a comb and ran it through my hair, and it hurt real bad,"" says the youngest brother, Joseph, known as Rev Run. ""I think he was high.""', 'Their father didn’t try to shield his sons from all violence. ""He respected what you learned in the culture in the street,"" says Russell. ""So he never really hid us from the stuff that was right on our corner."" That exposure also created motivation. ""Seeing tragedy always pushes you to move past it,"" says Danny, the oldest, who beat heroin addiction decades ago.', 'Video by Diane Tsai for TIME', 'Not all kids from tough neighbor\xadhoods make it out. But Russell is now a multimillionaire entrepreneur, a co-founder of Def Jam Recordings and the chairman and CEO of Rush Communications. Danny is a painter and author who co-created Def Poetry Jam on HBO with Russell and oversees the Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation. And Rev Run was one-third of the hip-hop trio Run-D.M.C. in the 1980s and ’90s and is now an ordained minister and reality-\xadTV star.', 'The Simmons brothers grew up closer to raw, systemic violence than most families in this story. But even outside Hollis, some of the families (especially those with boys) recalled a household dynamic that resembled a fight club. With a few notable exceptions, most described a sibling dynamic that was wildly competitive at best and physically violent at worst. They grew up in controlled chaos: heavy on conflict, light on manners and indifferent to standards of appropriate behavior.', 'Few recalled major rifts between their parents. But many of these siblings said they regularly fought with their brothers and sisters over everything from clothing to board games to who had to sit in the middle seat on long car trips. Zeke Emanuel puts it this way: ""If there wasn’t blood, it was a good night.""', 'Mealtime debates could get so vicious, they horrified outsiders. Joel Gay recalls that his wife was on the verge of tears when she first had dinner with his family. ""She said, ‘I have never seen anything like that. Why are you screaming at each other?’"" he remembers. ""If you don’t under\xadstand Haitian culture, you can think we’re actually fighting.""', 'The Simmons Family', 'Left: Courtesy of the Simmons Family; Right: Anthony Behar—Sipa Press/AP', 'Some of the rowdy behavior sounds like normal, run-of-the-mill mischief. Roxane and Joel Gay pushed their baby brother Michael down the stairs in a laundry basket. Susan and Janet Wojcicki loved to trick a young Anne into approaching strangers and calling them ""fat."" Gina Rodriguez once put glue in her sister Rebecca’s milk.', 'They committed all the venial sins of American teenagers, and some of the cardinal ones as well. Across the nine families, there were incidents of teenage parenthood, smoking pot, underage drinking, cutting school, bar fights, shoplifting and drag racing. At least two had parties when their parents weren’t home. Esther Wojcicki says she found out about her daughters’ secret house party only when a student came to school wearing clothes pilfered from her own closet. (Her daughters dispute that particular anecdote.)', 'For some of these siblings, growing up in a constant state of trial-by-\xadcombat made them tougher. For others, the bad behavior was a symptom of their willingness to make mistakes, an anti-\xadperfectionism that hardened into resilience. It wasn’t just that they fought; it was that they fought and then moved on. ""We were called a lot of bad names, and we had to withstand that and continue to go on,"" says Zeke Emanuel. ""That breeds a certain kind of toughness.""', 'And though few openly admit it, sibling rivalry can motivate achievement, says New York University psychologist Ben Dattner: ""Winning the Nobel Prize is a more civilized way of beating the crap out of your brother.""', 'LESSONS IN MORTALITY', 'Jack and Rachel Antonoff can’t describe their childhood without discussing the third Antonoff: their younger sister Sarah, who died of a brain tumor when she was 13.', 'Jack is a Grammy-winning musician who is the lead singer of Bleachers and lead guitarist of fun., now on hiatus. Rachel is a New York City–based fashion de\xadsigner. They’re unlike many of the other eight families: their parents aren’t immigrants or educators, nobody in their family cared much about politics, and they didn’t break rules, because there weren’t any rules to break. Instead, since their sister’s death more than a decade ago, the Antonoffs say they’re motivated by a constant awareness of their own mortality.', '""When you hear about a movie coming out that you’re excited to see, do you not think every time, Oh, I hope I’m still alive?"" Rachel asks, sitting in the Los Angeles studio where Jack is recording his latest album. Jack nods, digging into a cupcake in honor of his 32nd birthday. ""I have to get my gallbladder out, and I don’t want to do it until this record is done in case I die on the table,"" he says. ""Everything backs up to the amount of work I do before I die. That creates a work ethic. There’s an urgency.""', 'The Antonoff Family', 'Left: Courtesy of the Antonoff Family; Right: Amy Lombard', 'Posttraumatic growth is a tricky concept. For many kids and even adults, a loss of this magnitude may cause permanent devastation, not motivation. And yet while the Antonoffs experienced a loss significantly more shattering than most, many of the other eight families also experienced a brush with untimely death. The woman who was shot in the head in front of the Rodriguezes’ home was their cousin. The Simmons brothers saw friends and neighbors killed by drugs, AIDS and gang violence. Rahm Emanuel nearly died as a teenager when a deep cut in his finger developed into a bone infection. (He ended up losing half his finger.)', 'Such experiences can fuel ambition. After spending weeks in the hospital battling that life-threatening infection, Rahm says, he transformed from a slacker student into a go-getter. ""I made sure that given how close I came to dying, that I was never, ever going to not get the most out of everything I was doing,"" he says. ""I was a changed person.""', 'It can also help a family get their priorities straight. Jack and Rachel’s mother Shira Antonoff said Sarah’s death drowned out all the petty judgments and expectations of their suburban New Jersey community. She let her kids skip school, she didn’t insist they finish college, and she took Jack to get his lip pierced at age 15, to the shock and dismay of other mothers in the grocery store.', '""The core was, We’ve had a sick kid, we’ve had a kid who’s died, so let’s get real about what’s important here,"" Shira says. ""You’ve got to find a path in life that you’re really happy with.""', 'a free-range childhood', 'Like many of the other siblings in this story, Tan and Maya Lin grew up on a university campus, were raised by immigrant parents and bickered constantly over board games. They were also allowed to do practically anything they wanted. You could say it was the opposite of helicopter parenting.', 'Their father Henry Huan Lin had been forced to take calligraphy classes while growing up in China, an experience he loathed so much that it informed his parenting philosophy. ""He promised that when he had kids, they would never have to do anything they didn’t want to do,"" Maya says.', 'And so the Lin parents, who fled Mao and ultimately became professors at Ohio University, didn’t monitor their children’s homework or force them to join sports teams or push them to learn the piano. ""We were given all sorts of freedom to do whatever we wanted,"" recalls Tan, now a poet and the author of a dozen books. Maya, an artist and architect who designed the Vietnam Veterans \xadMemorial, puts it this way: ""They were the anti–dragon parents.""', 'The Lin Family', 'Left and Right: Courtesy of the Lin Family', 'The Lin siblings spent most of their time outside, or writing poems, or throwing clay in the university ceramics studio. They went to a high school with an open-module system, which meant that sometimes they went to class only two days a week. ""I’ve only ever chafed when there are rules,"" Maya says.', 'Few of the siblings in this story had parents who closely monitored their movements, and many said they were raised with significantly more freedom than their friends. By the standards of today’s helicopter parents, they ran wild. The Dungey sisters rode all over Sacramento on their bikes alone. The Antonoffs were allowed to skip school whenever they wanted. Six-year-old Zeke Emanuel regularly escorted 4-year-old Rahm home from nursery school on a Chicago city bus.', '""She was a supporter of us, but she didn’t tell us what to do, and she allowed us to play and develop our own ideas,"" says Zeke of his mother. ""She didn’t even worry too much whether they were safe or not.""', 'Esther Wojcicki taught her daughters to swim as soon as they could walk, specifically so that she wouldn’t have to watch them when they played near the backyard pool. ""I empowered them early, because I wanted to make sure they could take care of themselves,"" she says. ""They could read early, so they could read signs. They could do math early, so they could handle money.""', 'Even by the comparatively lax stan\xaddards of the 1970s, the Wojcicki girls had more freedom than most. Five-year-old Susan was often left to babysit 4-year-old Janet and infant Anne, and local mothers raised their eyebrows when the girls rode their bikes alone to the dime store a mile away.', 'But Esther has a theory. ""The more you do for your kids, the less they do for themselves, and the less empowered they feel,"" she says.', 'Thousands of extraordinary families flourish across America, and the new generation of hyperaware parents may raise thousands more. But none of the parents in this story set out to raise successful children. Instead, the six commonalities of our nine families combined to create drive, grit and social consciousness that propelled all the siblings on their own chosen paths.', '""You cannot reach anybody’s goal.

But imbibing to excess is a serious matter and the list released over the weekend from Around here we like good beer, we like good wine, we like good cocktails, and we certainly have had occasion to drink a few too many of those things. But imbibing to excess is a serious matter and the list released over the weekend from 24/7 Wall Street and compiled using data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute isn’t a top 10 anyone necessarily wants to be a part of. What that data showed was that 7 of the top 10 and 12 of the top 20 cities most inclined to binge are in the state of Wisconsin.', 'Now, as someone who still answers ""Wisconsin"" to the question ""Where are you from?"" I am familiar with the stereotypes of camouflage-coated ice fisherman slamming Millers on frigid January afternoons (or mornings), but this analysis went somewhat deeper than that. It looked at people who either binge drink (4-5 drinks in a sitting) or drink heavily (15 or more drinks per week) over 381 different metro areas.', ""Now the caveat to all this, is the numbers are all self reported, so the hopeful Wisconsinite in me wants to believe that people from Wisconsin are just a lot more honest about their drinking than people from California or Utah. Regardless, having nearly 27 percent of the adults in your town claim they drink to excess as they do in Appleton, is not a stat that will likely go up on any welcome signs you’d see at the city limits. The full list of America's heaviest drinking cities is below.""]",7 of the 10 Drunkest Cities in America Are All in a Single State,"Around here we like good beer, we like good wine, we like good

She and her husband live in an RV, chasing 70-degree weather (they were in Arizona when we spoke in late January) and enjoying the views of a slew of national parks including Colorado National Monument, Mesa Verde, Rocky Mountain, Arches, Moab, and others.', 'Her ticket out of debt and into financial freedom has been her blog, Making Sense of Cents, where she offers tips on saving and making money   and publishes income reports.', 'Michelle Schroeder-Gardner of the Making Sense of Cents blog and her husband, Wesley Gardner (Courtesy of Michelle Schroeder-Gardner)', ""It also doesn't hurt that she is naturally frugal. Even though I make $100,000 a month, I'll still wear my favorite shirt even if it has a hole in it, she says."", 'But the biggest reason for her success may be her internal drive.', ""I've always been super competitive, she says. I would always win at a board game or jump rope the most, little things like that, and people would often joke, Michelle's going to be president one day, or Michelle's going to be a millionaire one day, because I was always so competitive, determined, and independent. Her friends and family also thought she would be successful because she always helped others with their problems."", ""Growing up, I was always super determined, so I don't think anyone was surprised with how successful my blog was, she says. It was always expected of me   that I'd do something pretty out of the norm."", ""Here's how she paid off her debt and grew her income so quickly."", 'How did you pay off your student loans so quickly?', ""Six months before I graduated, I received a letter stating how much I would owe every month when I graduated. It was going to be $500 a month or so. I don't remember the number, but it was a number I felt was way too high for my income. I decided I didn't want it hanging over my head for the rest of my life, so I figured I would try to pay it off as quickly as I could so I didn't have to worry about it 10 years from now. I figured a little bit of pain now would be worthwhile later."", 'So in addition to being a financial analyst, I also did a bunch of side jobs. Altogether, I was working 100 hours a week. My side jobs consisted of taking surveys, mystery shopping, doing staff writing, doing research phone calls for companies and other things.', ""As soon as I earned any extra money, I put it toward my student loan debt so it wouldn't be sitting in my bank account and I wouldn't be thinking of other ways to spend it."", 'What were your expenses during this time?', 'My boyfriend at the time (now my husband) and I had bought a house when we were 20, and our mortgage was less than $1,000, but I had other regular expenses like transportation, groceries, etc. We also had combined our finances, so it helped that we shared our bills.', 'When did the blog start coming into the picture?', 'I had actually started my blog in August 2011, before I graduated with my finance MBA. I got the idea one day when I was reading Cosmo and they had an article featuring the personal finance site Daily Worth. I started reading that website and I became super-interested in personal finance blogs.', ""I started my blog as a hobby. I didn't start it thinking I'd make an income from it. Six months later, I made my first $100 from my blog when a blogger friend who was already profiting from her blog connected me with an advertiser. I didn't even know blogs could make money."", ""Until then, my blog had genuinely just been fun for me. But once I realized I could make money, it boosted my motivation. I sought out deals and wanted to see if companies wanted to sponsor my blog. Also, companies would approach me. When my blog had been just a hobby, they would approach me, but I would ignore all those emails. Once I realized I could make money from my blog, I took them more seriously and gave them my rates. At that time, I charged $100 for a sponsored post on my blog or $150 for an advertisement on my sidebar.  I also made a little bit on Google Adsense and affiliate income, where I was promoting other companies' products, and if one of my readers bought through me, the company would pay me."", ""My advertisers were mainly financial companies like coupon websites and cell phone apps and other services that helped people save money. At that time, it wasn't so much banks, but I do have bank advertisers now and I charge them much more than that of course."", 'I also started looking for opportunities writing for other bloggers and immersing myself into the blogging community.', 'How much did you earn from the blog to begin with?', 'In the beginning, in May of 2012, I earned $500. And by December 2012, I was up to $5,700 that month. The month I paid off my student loans, July of 2013, I earned $11,000 that month.', 'How exactly does the blog bring in money?', ""Now, I'm making money in much different ways from just a few years ago. Before I was making money from sponsored posts and by writing for other blogs, and now the majority is through affiliate marketing   $50,000 a month is from that, and that's the bulk of my income. There are 15-20 companies I actively promote on my social media and blog platform."", ""The other big revenue stream is my affiliate marketing course, in which I teach other bloggers how to create affiliate income. In November 2016, that accounted for $38,000 of my income. I created that because I had so many bloggers email me asking them to teach them how to increase their affiliate marketing earnings. Now it's more a form of passive income, since I already created the source and people just purchase it and all the instructions and lessons are already done."", 'My third biggest source of income from my blog is advertising. In those instances, maybe I partner with a bank and they ask me to advertise a certain service or product that they are currently selling. Or I participate in a Twitter chat with the company, or they do some kind of advertisement on my social media platforms.', 'Why did your income roughly triple from 2015 to 2016?', 'In 2015, I decided to stop doing all my freelancing. I stopped doing virtual assisting and decided to focus entirely on my blogging business. I was nervous to get rid of all my clients, but I realized I truly loved blogging myself and not blogging for others.', 'By focusing on my business, I was finally able to find ways to diversify my income, improve my blog, increase my traffic, and come up with extra ideas for my blog, such as the course, which now accounts for a big chunk of my income   20%-30%.', 'I also was able to focus on affiliate marketing and improving my traffic, which directly relates to making more money blogging as well. It only took me a few months after I dropped all those clients to start seeing the jump in my income.', 'I was making $12,000-$15,000 monthly when I decided I was going to focus just on my own business, then I made a jump to the $20,000-$30,000 range, and it just kept going to $40,000, then $50,000, to where I am now at $100,000.', 'How has your changing income changed your lifestyle?', 'As a full-time blogger I have a flexible schedule and am my own boss and now travel full-time. My husband, who used to be a new car salesman, quit his day job at the same time I quit mine in October 2013 when I was making $10,000 a month from the blog   and now works on the blog too. At the time, we were making more from our day jobs put together than from the blog, but we knew we could live off our blog if we did it full-time.', 'The main lifestyle change is that we live in an RV, are location-independent and work wherever we can. We sold our house in Missouri in July 2015 and now we work from wherever.', 'Why did you start living in an RV?', ""My husband has always wanted to live in an RV, and he spent a long time convincing me to live in an RV. There's always a joke in the RV community that there's always one person who wants to do it and then the other person has to spend years convincing the other person to do it.  That's pretty much how it was."", ""But I stepped into an RV one day   we just decided to look at one   and I loved being in it. So we decided to give RVing a shot. It was just going to be a weekend thing to see family or do short weekend or week trips, but we came to love it and never went home. We would be gone for a month or two at a time, so we just decided to turn the RV thing into a full-time venture and haven't looked back since."", 'How big was your house? ', ""We had a finished basement, and so if you count that, 2,500 square feet. If you don't, it was 1,200 square feet with three bedrooms."", 'How big is the RV?', ""It's 400 square feet if you include all the slides being out."", 'Did you have to get rid of a lot of stuff?', 'Yes, the Salvation Army came and took a bunch of stuff, and we rented a dumpster to collect broken appliances and junk and we had neighbors come and just take whatever they wanted for free. We kept clothing and photo albums.', ""How does living in an RV make your finances different from other people's?"", ""It doesn't really change. Our RV cost more than our house, but RVing can be as cheap or expensive as you want it to be   just like with a normal home. There are cheap RVs, and there are RVs worth millions of dollars. It's comparable to living in a home, but I have a different view all the time. There are free places to stay, but we mainly choose private campgrounds or state parks that cost money."", ""We usually stay in one place for a month. We like to follow the weather, so we like to stay in a forever 70-degree weather area, and we like to follow activities we like such as riding our bikes outside and going for a hike, so 70-degree weather is what we're looking for all year long."", 'How has all this newfound wealth changed you?', ""I'm not as stressed about money as I was just a few years ago. But I'm just as frugal as before. It's not below me to use a coupon. I just don't like to be wasteful. If there's a way to save money, I'm not going to waste time to find ways to save money, but if a money saver is there, I'll go for it."", 'How has your wealth changed your relationships?', ""It really hasn't changed them too much. We're often told that people are surprised we're the same and that you would expect people making $100,000 a month to not be as nice or down to earth. But many of our friends still call us down-to-earth."", 'How was money handled when you were growing up and what habits or attitudes did you carry into adulthood? ', ""My mom wasn't super good with money, but my dad was better, so I learned what to do from him. He taught me how to live within my budget and also how to use a credit card correctly. A lot of people think credit cards are the root of all evil, but you can use them to build your credit score and you can earn rewards points with them."", ""I'm still very frugal. I don't pay for any form of TV, I don't have cable, Netflix, Hulu or anything like that. We haven't spent any money on TV since February 2015 to save money and also to not spend as much time watching TV. I feel like there's plenty of things to watch on local channels. If I had any more channels, I'd be in front of the TV all day long."", 'How much time do you spend on your blog?', ""Between 40 and 60 hours a week. I work longer hours when I'm trying to get far ahead in my blog content. I currently do three blog posts a week."", 'Do you have help?', 'I do have an editor who edits my site and a tech person to make sure my site is always up and live and no one is hacking it.', 'What do you do with your extra income? ', ""We invest a lot in Vanguard funds and are saving for retirement one day. By next year, we should have plenty of money to retire early if we chose too. But I still love blogging, so I don't see that ending anytime soon."", ""For the next few years, we plan on RVing here and in Canada, and then afterward sailing full-time and go to other countries. I'd have to find ways to manage my internet access. But we do know many bloggers who blog full-time and sail, so it's not impossible.""]",How This 27-Year-Old Made $1 Million Last Year,"Four years ago, Michelle Schroeder-Gardner was almost $40,000 in debt.

But the beloved British children’s book author was also known for the distinctive language he used to create the vivid, often dark, worlds in which the characters lived.', 'To honor the centenary of his birth this month, the Oxford English Dictionary has updated its latest edition today (Sept. 12) with six new words connected to Dahl’s writing, and revisions to six other phrases popularized by Dahl’s evocative stories. In May, the Oxford University Press also published a Roald Dahl Dictionary complete with 8,000 words coined or popularized by the author.', 'There was linguistic method to Dahl’s mad use of language. ""He was using very linguistic principles,"" says Vineeta Gupta, head of children’s dictionaries at Oxford University Press. Dahl invented words based on old words, rhymes, malapropisms, and spoonerisms (swapping the first letters of words around, such as ""catasterous disastrophe"" from The BFG). Dahl also played with sound (""sizzle-pan"" to refer to a frying pan in The BFG, for example).', 'Here are the new Dahlisms added to the OED, and the revised phrases, with notes on their origins.', 'New entries', 'Dahlesque The characteristics of Dahl’s work—in the OED’s words, ""eccentric plots, villainous or loathsome adult characters, and gruesome or black humour""—now have their own adjective. The term was first used in 1983 by the literary magazine Books Ireland.', 'Golden ticket These refer to the tickets hidden in chocolate bars that granted access to Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964). The first golden ticket, however, was awarded to 18th century painter William Hogarth, giving him admission to the Vauxhall Gardens in London, in recognition of his paintings of the venue.', 'Human bean This is a mispronunciation of ""human being,"" uttered by the giant in The BFG (1982): ""We is having an interesting babblement about the taste of the human bean. The human bean is not a vegetable."" The first instance of the phrase is over a century older, having been used in an issue of the British satirical magazine Punch in 1842.', 'Oompa Loompa The diminutive factory workers who played music and danced in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory were made more famous by the 1971 film adaption of the book, starring Gene Wilder. Gupta called the phrase ""typical Dahlesque,"" reflecting how the author played with sound to convey meaning.', 'Scrumdiddlyumptious ""Extremely scrumptious', 'excellent, splendid', '(esp. of food) delicious."" Although the word was first found in The American Thesaurus of Slang in 1942, Dahl’s giant’s use of it planted it firmly in the minds of every child who read The BFG: ""Every human bean is diddly and different. Some is scrumdiddlyumptious and some is uckyslush.""', 'Witching hour Referred to in The BFG as ""a special moment in the middle of the night when every child and every grown-up was in a deep deep sleep, and all the dark things came out from hiding and had the world to themselves."" We can thank Shakespeare for this evocative phrase: according to the OED, ""witching time"" first appeared in Hamlet (1604).']",Scrumdiddlyumptious to Oompa Loompa: Six of Roald Dahl’s splendiferous words have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary,"Roald Dahl is remembered for his solitary, kind-hearted child heroes—Charlie, who visited a chocolate factory, and Sophie, who befriended a floppy-eared giant, among them—and their triumphs over bullying adults.

As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don’t want to compromise what’s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.', 'Yesterday, we previewed new moderator mail to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we’re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system.

But as Trump's win proved true in politics, the cannabis industry, too, is riddled with white men in power—even if they aren't the ones who deserve all the credit. Women—from researchers studying the benefits of cannabis over opiates, to award-winning chefs cooking up the most delicious edibles on the planet, to those who are facing massive jail time for activism and legalization efforts—are the true heroes of the cannabis industry, and it’s time to recognize that. To celebrate women in weed, we spoke to 15 of the most powerful and influential women in the business:"", '1. Dr. Lakisha Jenkins, Master Herbalist', 'Dr. Lakisha Jenkins has a doctorate in naturopathy, is a member of the American Herbalist Guild, and is a master herbalist, and founding board member of the California Cannabis Industry Association. Beyond helping write the legalization laws that just passed in the state of California, Dr. Jenkins can take 500 varieties of herbs and marry them with cannabis to treat whatever ails you. If you love pot and natural medicine, she’s someone you want to know.', 'Unfortunately, despite the abundance of healing Dr. Jenkins gives back to the world, she went through great loss to get where she is today. ""My oldest daughter Kiona was diagnosed with two different types of brain tumors in 2002 when she was eight years old, and I questioned whether chemotherapy and radiation was the right course of action for treatment for her,"" explains Dr. Jenkins. ""I was informed that the State of California knows what’s better for my daughter than I do and that if I did anything different than conventional treatment, then I’d be acting outside of medical advice and that I would be a threat to her. Unfortunately, I was forced to accept, but while she was going through chemotherapy and radiation, I started researching and studying for my doctorate, and figuring out other holistic alternatives.""', 'Kiona passed away in January 2006, 12 days shy of her twelfth birthday. Dr. Jenkins now practices in her honor, going back to her roots and using ancestral healing techniques.', '""My family is from the Mississippi band of Choctaw Indians, so we have Native American lineage and my grandfather is a native healer,"" she explains. ""I just went back to my native roots and just researched."" Along with her work as a healer, Dr. Jenkins strives to create room for minorities in the cannabis industry that is too often dominated by white men due to financial advantages and their inherent privilege.', '""There’s a privilege that is associated with being a white male in this country, you don’t have that same type of fear that other minority groups or other people do and you’re more in a position to take a risk in jumping into this industry,"" explains Dr. Jenkins, who has also been a part of the Minority Business Council for three years.', 'Her advice to women and other minorities looking to break through? ""Be fearless and strong in your conviction. Know what you stand for and know what you are trying to accomplish and don’t let anything get in your way. Surround yourself with other like-minded people who can be your support system and your tribe and then educate yourself, because education is going to be what’s going to help you persevere. Because people are going to challenge you all the time. But if you can come back with those challenges with hard evidence and experience, and really speak to the level of professionalism that this industry is going to command, you’ll be taken seriously.""', '2. Rachel K. Gillette, Attorney', ""An unfortunate aspect of the cannabis industry is that due to lingering federal laws and constantly evolving local ones, if you work with weed, you'll likely need a lawyer at some point. That’s where Rachel Gillette comes in"", 'an attorney who has been working with the regulated cannabis industry since 2010. Her areas of practice include corporate licensing compliance, tax law for marijuana businesses, and pretty much anything related to the operations of cannabis businesses regulated by the state of Colorado.', '""I’ve always been an advocate for the legalization of marijuana,"" says Gillette. ""So in 2010, when I saw the state of Colorado was going to be regulating, being the first state in the nation to do so, I decided to quit my job and to start my own practice which focused on the representation of these newly-formed business enterprises."" At the time, Gillette was taking a major risk since few larger firms were ready to take on cannabis clients. However, Gillette’s instincts and boldness paid off and she staked her claim in what is now a booming industry.', 'Gillette says her favorite part the job is that marijuana law is constantly evolving ""We’re doing something that has never been done before, so there’s a lot of opportunities to blaze the trail, so to speak, no pun intended,"" she explains. Not to mention, working to help victims of America’s War On Drugs: ""We’ve had 40 years of a failed drug war, our fathers, our brothers, our children are incarcerated at alarming rates unfortunately for minority populations, and disproportional rates for minority populations, and as women, we shouldn’t stand for that anymore.""', '3. Lynne Lyman, California State Director for the Drug Policy Alliance', 'While California cannabis users celebrate their state’s recent marijuana legalization accomplishment, (nice Hollyweed sign), Lynne Lyman’s work is just getting started. She\'s the California state director of the non-profit organization Drug Policy Alliance, ""the leading organization advancing drug policies grounded in science, compassion, health, and human rights.""', '""We always say November 8th wasn’t the end, it was the beginning,"" she explains. ""That’s true with most laws', 'often policymakers forget to think about the implementation piece and sometimes that’s the most important piece, because if you pass a law and it doesn’t get implemented, then it’s as if it didn’t pass.""', 'Along with working to fund cannabis research, Lyman’s biggest passion is making marijuana and marijuana-advocacy communities more inclusive, especially by creating space for those were were a vital part of the weed industry before it was sanctioned by mainstream society.', '""You’re walking in today to this whole nice legal world where everybody can wear a name tag that says they’re with some cannabis association, whereas five years ago even, people were still doing federal time for having a dispensary,"" Lyman explains. ""The advice I give to all of the people who come into the cannabis industry is understand the history. There’s the sense that people are just waltzing in as if it’s just any other industry. I want to discourage that and remind that a lot of people have died, people have been incarcerated, they’ve had their families destroyed. Making sure you’re a good neighbor, and you’re working with the community that you are based in.""', 'Lyman says that while we see often see white men as the faces of legal weed businesses, that doesn\'t mean they\'re the ones who laid the groundwork for legalization in the first place. ""One thing that has been true historically in the cannabis movement is that it’s been men’s faces at the forefront and yet it’s been a lot of women doing the behind-the-scenes work,"" explains Lyman. ""I’m in room after room saying it cannot be all white men in the industry. You have to find a way to expand and let other people in. That’s a policy priority for DPA.""', '4. Charlo Greene, Founder of Alaska Cannabis Club', 'You may remember Charlo Greene from when she went viral for quitting her job as a reporter on like television while outing herself as the founder of Alaska Cannabis Club. Now living in Los Angeles, Greene says, ""I’m Charlo ""Fuck it, I quit"" Greene, and I’m credited with the legalization of marijuana in Alaska."" An exceptional entrepreneur, she’s also behind NewCannabisTimes.com and the founder of Go Greene, a cannabis diversity summit series.', '""I use my connections to pull in as many community leaders of color to come in and share their knowledge, experience and expertise with people that really need a leg up in this industry, and make it mean something for them and their communities,"" says Greene. ""I think a lot of the work that I’m doing is overlooked because I am a woman and because I am a person of color.""', 'Greene’s success has come with a heavy price that proves the War on Drugs in far from over. ""I’m facing 54 years for creating the Alaska Cannabis Club, so in the meantime, it’s dreary that my life could be over this year,"" she explains. ""But if I stop doing what I know I am here to do, which is share these amazing stories and activate people, then the state has already won.""', 'Greene adds that she didn’t quit her job as a reporter because she hated it, but because she knew there was work to be done in marijuana advocacy: ""There was a community of people that needed someone to be bold and I knew that was me. So I’m gonna continue what I’m doing, just on my own terms with The Weed Show.""', 'Her next court appearance is January 11, and she’s assembled a top-notch legal team and is feeling hopeful, yet knows both America and the weed industry still have insurmountable work to do. ""It will be interesting when they try to drag up club members that literally credit the [Alaska Cannabis Club] for saving their lives. I think the state of Alaska will be on trial just as much as they’re putting me on trial.""', '5. Jessica Peters, President of Moxie Meds', 'Moxie Meds, a CBD-rich line of cannabis tinctures, is medicine for women, by women. Available in a variety of combinations to heal what ails you—from anxiety to PTSD to period cramps and pain—Moxie Meds grows their CBD-rich flowers following organic standards to create what is known as FECO (full extract cannabis oil), using organic ethanol to extract the cannabinoids and terpenes.', '""We add organic basil extract (which contains beta-caryophyllene) and lab grade, U.S. made, naturally extracted beta-caryophyllene (BCP) as well. We also add organic strawberry extract for flavor balancing - doesn\'t taste overwhelmingly like strawberry, it just balances out the plant and BCP flavor profile,"" explains Peters.', 'She says the favorite part of her work is without a doubt assisting patients, from veterans whose PTSD is diminished with treatment, to elderly patients who now live happier and healthier without chronic pain, to women who are no longer feeling stuck without options to address their reproductive concerns. ""Women have always been healers throughout history and this (female) plant represents what I personally consider the fastest moving area of science and medicine,"" says Peters. ""We need women to help bring cannabis medicine to the next level for the sake of patients everywhere.""\'']",15 Of The Most Powerful Women In The Weed Industry,"From researchers to lawyers to viral stars, here&#39;s a list of 15 women pioneering the marijuana industry.",,,https://www.complex.com/life/2017/04/women-weed-industry/,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': None, 'spoilerPublisher': None}","['1.

He says the media using criticism of Matt Lauer's performance during a candidates forum this month to pressure the moderators into attack mode."", '""They\'re hitting Matt Lauer, and that\'s sort of indicative of what they\'re — they\'re trying to game the system,"" Trump told Fox News last weekend. ""They want — and this, I think, is terrible — they want the hosts to go after Trump. And that\'s what they\'re doing by gaming the system.""', ""Conspiratorial as Trump's theory is, it can't be disproven. But the shot he took at Holt can be."", '""Lester is a Democrat,"" Trump told Bill O\'Reilly last week. ""It’s a phony system. They are all Democrats. It’s a very unfair system.""', 'These are the people who will be lobbing questions at Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton when they go head-to-head at the 2016 presidential debates. The first debate is slated for September 26. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)', 'Time magazine checked the voter rolls in New York, and it turns out Holt is actually a registered Republican. Trump still might find things to complain about Monday night, but a case for partisan bias against him will be tough to make.', 'Holt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992', 'Holt, whose grandparents immigrated to the United Stats from Jamaica, is the first black moderator of a general election presidential debate since Carole Simpson in 1992. Gwen Ifill moderated vice-presidential debates in 2004 and 2008, and Bernard Shaw moderated the VP debate in 2000, but it has been 24 years since a black journalist moderated a debate between the major-party nominees for president.', 'Holt, whom NBC declined to make available for interviews before the debate, does not talk about his race often. He did say this to the Chicago Tribune in 1995, when the paper profiled the then-anchor of WBBM-TV\'s nightly newscast: ""Everyone knows I\'m black. I am who I am. This is the person that Lester Sr. and June Holt raised, and I make no apology for it. At the same time, I\'m never going to pull a race card to get what I want. You can\'t have it both ways.""', ""Dominic Carter, a fellow black TV journalist who moderated one of Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign debates in 2006, said Holt's selection is significant, but viewers should not expect his background to influence his questioning."", '""We are journalists first,"" Carter said. ""That\'s a huge distinction. We\'re not there to advocate on issues relating to African Americans. We\'re there advocating and asking questions on behalf of the American people. You don\'t want people to put you in the box of the black guy doing the debate. So you have to be over and above in terms of fairness and professionalism.""', ""He's not really into the Twitter"", ""Holt, 57, has not tweeted in almost a month. He was fairly active while in Rio de Janeiro during NBC's coverage of the Olympics, sharing images like these:"", ""Scratching item off list of things I've never done before a newscast. Beach volleyball. Tonight @NBCNightlyNews pic.twitter.com/CRmpnCcpNU — Lester Holt (@LesterHoltNBC) August 7, 2016"", 'Joining on stage for some Brazilian Jazz in Rio tonight. #BoyFromIpanema pic.twitter.com/xJ5MoYGtPZ — Lester Holt (@LesterHoltNBC) August 13, 2016', ""In general, however, it is not unusual for Holt to go several days or even a week between tweets. His relative disinterest in social media stands in contrast to Trump's obsession."", 'He moderated a Democratic primary debate', 'Holt got to practice his moderating skills at a Democratic debate in January, though he split questioning duties that night with Andrea Mitchell.', 'He was not involved in any major clashes during the debate but showed a willingness to ask tough questions, such as when he asked Clinton about the ""reset button"" with Russia during her tenure as secretary of state.', '""Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia\'s foreign minister a reset button in 2009,"" Holt said. ""Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?""', ""Holt has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree"", 'Apparently the secret to becoming a big-time political anchor is not graduating from college. ""Meet the Press"" anchor Chuck Todd never finished his studies at George Washington University. (He told me he plans to do so before his kids go to college.) The late ABC anchor Peter Jennings never even went to college, dropping out of high school.', 'Holt left California State University-Sacramento after two years to work at a radio station in San Francisco. The Sacramento Bee told the story last year:', 'Lester Holt Sr. was concerned in 1979 when he learned that his son was planning to drop out of California State University, Sacramento, to work at a San Francisco radio station. But he wasn’t as worried as his wife, June. ""She predicted poverty and failure,"" he said with a laugh. But the Rancho Cordova couple gave their blessing, firm in the belief that Lester Jr. would go far with hard work, talent and a likeable personality in his chosen field of broadcast journalism.', 'Things worked out okay. Since dropping out, Holt has received honorary doctorates from Cal State Sacramento and Pepperdine University.']",5 things to know about presidential debate moderator Lester Holt,He's not really into the Twitter.,"Lester Holt, debate, moderator, Clinton, Trump, NBC","['http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819im_/https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&op=resize&w=60&h=60&filter=nearest&fmt=png', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819im_/https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&op=resize&w=480&h=270&filter=nearest&fmt=png', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819im_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819im_/https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&op=resize&w=138&h=92&filter=nearest&fmt=png', 'http://web.archive.org/web/jsp/graph.jsp?graphdata=550_27_1996:-1:000000000000_1997:-1:000000000000_1998:-1:000000000000_1999:-1:000000000000_2000:-1:000000000000_2001:-1:000000000000_2002:-1:000000000000_2003:-1:000000000000_2004:-1:000000000000_2005:-1:000000000000_2006:-1:000000000000_2007:-1:000000000000_2008:-1:000000000000_2009:-1:000000000000_2010:-1:000000000000_2011:-1:000000000000_2012:-1:000000000000_2013:-1:000000000000_2014:-1:000000000000_2015:-1:000000000000_2016:8:000000005010_2017:-1:000000000000', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819im_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png', 'http://web.archive.org/static/images/toolbar/wm_tb_prv_off.png', 'http://web.archive.org/static/images/toolbar/wm_tb_nxt_on.png', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819im_/https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-02/AP/Campaign_2016-Debate_Moderators-5d68b.jpg&w=480', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819im_/https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/files/2016/08/Untitled.png&w=480', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819im_/https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://wp-eng-static.washingtonpost.com/author_images/borchersc.jpg?ts=1449144756528&w=180&h=180', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819im_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/push_notifications/notification_denied_v1.png', 'http://web.archive.org/static/images/toolbar/wayback-toolbar-logo.png', 'https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-02/AP/Campaign_2016-Debate_Moderators-5d68b.jpg', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819im_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/politics/testshadeflower45.png', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819im_/https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image']",http://web.archive.org/web/20160926112819/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/25/5-things-to-know-about-presidential-debate-moderator-lester-holt/,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': ""He's the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992, not really into the Twitter, moderated a Democratic primary debate, has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree, and a registered Republican."", 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}","['Holt is a registered Republican', 'Holt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992', ""He's not really into the Twitter"", 'He moderated a Democratic primary debate', ""Holt has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree""]","[[[3, 0], [3, 31]], [[10, 0], [10, 64]], [[15, 0], [15, 32]], [[20, 0], [20, 40]], [[24, 0], [24, 58]]]",['multi']

If you don’t know what you have or where it is, you’re going to have a tough time selling it.', 'Luckily, you don’t have to go broke just keeping an eye on your product. Here are five free or open source inventory management offerings for small businesses.', 'inFlow is an inventory management software focused on small and medium businesses. The company has been growing since 2007 and now claims over 750,000 users. inFlow has a free option that limits you to 100 products and customers, and a baker’s dozen reports. You also miss out on some advanced user features and inventory management options.', 'The free version has no expiration, though, and small businesses will be well-served by the small set of options. Default features include barcoding, different accounting methods, and automatic data backup, among others.', 'Once you outgrow the free version, inFlow can be upgraded for a one-off, $399 payment. That will unlock unlimited products and customers, more reports, and advanced features like customized invoices and order forms. Paying customers also get a year of support.', 'Carta is the online offering from the people who brought you inFlow. Carta also offers a slimmed down free version. Carta’s limitations are based on the number of sales per month that can be processed — at the free level, it’s a mere 10.', 'Luckily, every level is currently free since Carta is still in its beta testing phase. You might have a few hiccups along the way, but you can get the $99 per month package for free, right now. The company anticipates the free betas running through the end of 2015, so you’ll have plenty of time to figure out which package works for you.', 'Carta includes some interesting options for collaboration with buyers and sellers, so you can assist folks through the ordering process. With the background from inFlow, Carta should offer you everything a small business needs.', 'Rightcontrol Lite provides inventory management for ten product lines. It also comes with invoice and receipt generation tools, geared toward the small business or self-employed individual. Apart from a limitation on product lines, the Lite flavor offers all the features of its bigger sisters and brothers in the Rightcontrol line.', 'Users can set automatic reorder reminders when stock gets low, can print labels for stock, and can integrate with a barcode system. If you need more than the ten products or want more users, growing businesses can upgrade to Rightcontol Solo, Pro, or Workgroup for about $1.50, $7.50, or $30 per month — the company’s rates are given in British Pounds. Each comes with an increase in the number of products that can be managed.', 'We’ve talked about Odoo here before , but it’s because there’s a lot to like. For two people using the online system, Odoo is free. If you download the open source version and host it yourself, Odoo can be free for everyone, though you’ll have to support it yourself.', 'Odoo is designed as an ERP, but thanks to the software’s add-on app layout, you can make it as large or small as your business requires. For inventory management, you’ll probably want to take advantage of at least the warehouse management system and perhaps the purchase or point of sales system as well.', 'Since it’s an ERP, all of your data will be combined in the backend, so purchases can flow into inventory and into your accounting, as well. Odoo online can be a great open source answer for a small business, while larger businesses can get a lot out of the full featured software.', 'ABC Inventory is the child of Almyta Control System. It’s a free package for a single user, allowing you to manage multiple warehouses, serial numbers, warranties, and a host of other inventory related data. This free version is really designed to be run on one computer, though, as multiple workstations can’t sync the same data.', 'As with almost all free options, you’ll be supplying the support — though there are some forums to give you a hand if things get tough. ABC is geared specifically toward smaller companies that don’t need all the bells and whistles that come with a bigger system.', 'Final thoughts', 'All of these systems can manage most small business inventory requirements, with many offering flexibility to move up as your company grows. Odoo may have the strongest position for an existing large company, but the low prices for its competitors mean that there are plenty of options within most budgets.', 'What other free inventory software solutions are out there?

eafcd66b-c45f-4aaf-81d1-e16fb5e7bf7a,4ttv4g,8 things that will be more expensive next month,reddit,"['1. Cold-Weather Clothing © Provided by Gobankingrates cold weather clothing expensive In July, the cold-weather months seem far away, but as we get into August and to the back-to-school and holiday season, stores start to put out fall merchandise. This means the prices on items like warm coats, long pants, boots and sweaters will be at their highest during this month. You might find back-to-school sales on some of these items, but you won’t find any deep discounts like you can during other months. A great way to save money on clothing all year is to shop during the off-season. For example, look for discounts on cold-weather clothing during the spring and early summer months, and purchase your summer gear during August and September, according to Consumer Reports. Another tip to shopping in the off-season is to always keep your receipts. The discounts on off-season clothing can increase quickly and dramatically, and stores like Target, Sears and Kmart have price-match policies for anywhere from 14 to 30 days after purchase.', '2. Back-to-School Supplies', '© Provided by Gobankingrates back to school supplies expensive Not surprisingly, August is a big month for back-to-school shopping. Sales on school supplies are easy to find, but the prices might not be as low compared to other months. Since retailers know consumers are looking for sales on school supplies during August, it’s not uncommon for them to stock up on lots of shiny new things that are more expensive than your traditional supplies. Shelves will be stocked with inexpensive ""loss leaders,"" like pencils and paper to get you in the door. But retailers count on you to also purchase full-priced items with high profit margins — like binders, graph paper and computer memory sticks, according to Time.com. It’s an exciting time for kids, and it’s easy to get tempted into buying all the new things. Consider keeping a stock of basic and inexpensive school supplies, like paper, pens, pencils and binders to get you through the first few weeks of school. Wait to buy the rest of your school supplies in September, which is typically the best month to score rock-bottom prices on this stuff.', '3. Theme Park Tickets © Provided by Gobankingrates theme park tickets expensive The summer season is an ideal time for a family to The summer season is an ideal time for a family to head to a popular theme park , but ticket prices are at their highest during these months. Typically, theme parks are the most crowded when kids are out of school, through late August, during the week of Thanksgiving, over the winter holidays and during spring break season. Because the demand is so high, these businesses charge the most they can for entrance to the park, according to Nasdaq.com. Not only does this put a major dent in your wallet, but it can also increase how much time you have to wait to go on a ride. So you’re paying top-dollar to visit the park, but getting less value because you have to spend so much time waiting to see the attractions. Dave Shute, co-author of ""The Easy Guide to Your First Walt Disney World Visit"" recommended vising Disney World between the second week of Easter and the week before Memorial day, mid-to-late October, any week in November other than Thanksgiving, and during December up to a week before Christmas.', '4. Patio Furniture © Provided by Gobankingrates patio furniture expensive The last full month of summer might seem like a good time to buy new patio furniture, but retailers usually wait until September to really drop prices on these goods, according to DealNews. August is still a warm month, and customers will pay full price to lounge outdoors and soak up the sun. Since you can easily spend $400 to $2,000 or more on an outdoor furniture set, according to HowMuchIsIt.org, it’s smart to wait until then, as retailers will be trying to quickly sell off the remaining goods. Keep in mind that popular stores like Sears and Home Depot might sell out of discounted outdoor furniture more quickly than a small retailer, so keep your eye out for deals starting at the end of August, according to personal finance advice website SmartAsset. But if you buy before Labor Day, you’ll likely pay more than you would later, according to CBS News.', '5. Televisions © Provided by Gobankingrates televisions expensive Deals on televisions are usually scarce during the summer months, and prices are still high on HDTVs in August. Prices do start to drop in the fall, as the summer comes to a close and the holiday season starts to ramp up. If you need to purchase a new TV before the prime season, DealNews recommended looking for a name-brand 55-inch TV or larger for around $500, although you might be able to save around $100 by going for an off-brand. Also, college students who want to upgrade the TVs or LCDs in their rooms should wait until school has been in session for at least a few weeks to score better prices.', '6. iPhones and iPads © Provided by Gobankingrates iphones ipads expensive August is a terrible time to August is a terrible time to upgrade your Apple devices because the company usually unveils their upcoming models in September or October, reported DealNews. This means the price on an Apple device purchased in August will immediately begin to lose value in the coming weeks and months. If you’re in the market for a new iPhone or iPad, either purchase it earlier in the summer or wait for deals on older models in the fall.', '7. Bicycles © Provided by Gobankingrates bicycles expensive August is plenty warm enough to still enjoy outdoor cycling, so it’s typically a bad month to invest in a new bicycle. If you can wait, prices start to drop closer to the fall, with discounts starting in August and lasting through December, according to Consumer Reports. Just like car dealerships, bike shops need to make room for the new inventory toward the end of the year. So the best time to look for a rock-bottom deal is during the winter months, according to Bicycling.com. The site also recommended avoiding models that are more than a few years old, even if they are deeply discounted. Advances in cycling technology change so quickly that a ""great deal"" might actually just be an average one if you can get a far superior model for just a little bit more money.']",8 things that will

Social scientists and policy makers have some ideas, as do companies that have been trying to combat the problem in their work forces.', 'Publish Everyone’s Pay', 'When employers publish people’s salaries, the pay gap shrinks.', 'Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist at Washington University, has found that salary transparency raises wages, in part by lending legitimacy to employees’ arguments in wage bargaining. ""Even being cognizant of gender pay disparity being an issue can change norms,"" he said.', 'That has been true in the public sector, where disclosing pay information is often required. Alexandre Mas, an economist at Princeton, studied the effects of a 2010 California law that required cities to publish municipal salaries. It prompted pay cuts, but only among men.', 'Women might have been spurred to negotiate after seeing that their salaries were lower, he theorized, or cities might have made salaries more equitable to avoid lawsuits.', 'A few European countries have required that big companies publish pay information by sex. President Obama in 2014 required that federal contractors report it to the Labor Department. Other American companies say they have analyzed pay this way, though most do it privately.', 'Marc Benioff, the C.E.O of Salesforce.com, said last year that after such an analysis, the company spent $3 million to make women’s salaries equal to men’s. Kimberly-Clark and PricewaterhouseCoopers have said their examinations led managers to address the fact that fewer women were reaching top positions.', 'To Negotiate, or Not', 'Men are paid more partly because they’re much more likely to ask for it.', 'When receiving job offers, 51.5 percent of men and 12.5 percent of women asked for more money, according to a study of Carnegie Mellon University graduate students by Linda Babcock, an economist at the university. In other research, she found that when women did ask, they asked for 30 percent less than men requested.', 'Because starting salaries determine raises and future salaries, women who do not bargain lose as much as $750,000 for middle-income jobs and $2 million for high-income jobs over their careers, Ms. Babcock found.', 'But her research and that of others has found that women are penalized for negotiating, while men are rewarded for the same behavior. (As the actress Jennifer Lawrence wrote in Lenny after the Sony hacking revealed that she was paid less than her male co-stars, she didn’t fight for more because ""I didn’t want to seem ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled.’ "")', 'One solution, Ms. Babcock said, is to coach women to negotiate. Another is to change corporate practices so the people who set compensation are aware of the disparity and are advocates for women during negotiations.', 'Another answer is to ban pay negotiation completely. That is what Ellen Pao did when she was chief executive of Reddit. The company established pay ranges based on roles and experience and gave applicants nonnegotiable offers.', '""We put the onus on the company to pay fairly instead of on candidates to negotiate fair pay,"" Ms. Pao wrote in The Hollywood Reporter.', 'Don’t Rely on Previous Salaries', 'If women can lose millions over their careers because they get job offers based on pay that is already low, one way to stop the pattern is to ignore their past salaries.', 'Google has said it does this and instead makes offers based on what a job is worth.', 'In August, the federal Office of Personnel Management said government hiring managers could no longer rely on an employee’s previous salary when setting his or her new one. The acting director, Beth Cobert, explained that the practice particularly disadvantaged women who had taken time off to raise children. Women are also more likely to have worked in the lower-paying public or nonprofit sectors.', '""Don’t ask about salary history for new hires, and it really reduces the impact of previous discrimination,"" Ms. Babcock said. ""I think that is the most effective thing organizations can do.""', 'Make Work Easier for Mothers', 'Research has found that salaries at men and women’s first jobs out of school are fairly similar. The gender pay gap widens a few years later when women start having children.', 'Sometimes their pay lags because they take breaks from work when their children are young, work fewer hours or take more time off than men for child care crises. Sometimes their employers assume they’ll do so, even if they don’t.', 'Policies that help keep women in the work force, like affordable child care, paid sick days and parental leave, could help. In states that offer paid parental leave, for instance, mothers are more likely to return to work, work more hours and earn higher wages, economists have found.', '""If a cashier gets pregnant, has no parental leave, has to leave and reapply for her job, that’s not the same as making a career choice,"" said Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. ""One thing policy can do is make it easier for women to stick with their careers.""', 'Build More Flexible Workplaces', 'Ms. Goldin of Harvard has found that the pay gap is largest in occupations with the least flexibility in terms of where and when people work, like finance and medicine. The gap shrinks when people can work on their own schedules, as in many tech jobs and when people can easily substitute for one another, as happens among pharmacists. Then, women aren’t penalized as much for working fewer hours.', 'Companies might address the culture of face time and overwork, and change how they operate. In a pharmacy, for instance, electronic medical records have made it easier for different pharmacists to serve the same patient.', 'Change the Law', 'Federal law doesn’t require most of these things, so some lawmakers are trying other tactics.', 'The strongest equal pay bill in the country went into effect in California this month. It says that men and women must be paid the same for similar jobs, not just for exactly the same job at the same site, as the looser federal Equal Pay Act requires. The California law also prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for discussing pay.', 'Proposed federal legislation known as the Paycheck Fairness Act would require companies to report pay data to the government, give grants for negotiation training and make class-action lawsuits easier.

But is your company sales smart? If you're like most organizations, the answer is probably not really. Sales teams face two perennial problems. No matter their industries or how large their companies, most lack a properly implemented training regimen and the resources to do their jobs efficiently."", ""You can have insanely talented salespeople, and they'll still make the same mistakes over and over again if they don't have proper training. When people don't feel they're supported because they're constantly wanting for resources, they eventually burn out. But many companies fail to address these needs within their sales department, and they end up losing their top representatives because of it."", 'Becoming Sales Intelligent', ""Modern technology didn't create a training or resource crisis, but it did change the types of tools and training that social selling requires. Rapidly shifting sales techniques demand a proactive attitude toward salesforce development. Productivity tools have enabled salespeople to work smarter and spend more time interfacing with clients than managing mundane tasks. The flip side of this is that prospects and customers expect rapid results and constant access. Sales teams must be prepared for the 24/7 nature of their jobs."", 'This is where sales intelligence comes in. Sales and marketing overlap more than ever before. Organizations that rely heavily on cold-calling for lead generation need to know whom to target and how to reach them with actionable messages.', 'A few years ago, they would have used simple Google searches and corporate websites to piece together this information. Now, a multitude of services help businesses identify prospects, collect contact information, load the data into their CRMs, and schedule drip campaigns. In this sense, many sales reps are operating their own mini-marketing departments.', ""Sales intelligence encompasses this entire data-gathering process. It includes all the contextual information you need about your sales contacts: purchase histories, industries, response rates, and other metrics that help you tailor your strategies to each target. The better you know your audience, the more effective your campaigns will be. That's Sales 101. But sales intelligence platforms enable you to put that concept to work by building more detailed profiles than were possible in the past."", ""Still, the concept of sales intelligence is relatively new. Sales managers and executives are understandably wary of investing in tools and strategies if they're not clear on how the business will benefit. Sales intelligence tools improve efficiency and can increase conversions and profits. But they're effective only if you approach them correctly. Here's how to build sales intelligence within your company:"", '1. Emphasize productivity.', ""The greatest virtue of sales intelligence tools is that they save so much time. You most likely hired your reps on the basis of their sales acumen, not their stellar research skills. Rather than having them spend hours scouring the internet for details about prospects, intelligence tools get them to the right people and companies faster. Cultivate a passion for productivity among your sales teammates. They'll be thrilled to try out new platforms that provide them with more time to do what they do best: sell."", '2. Evaluate potential ROI.', ""The big questions with new tools are always: How much will this cost? And what's the ROI? Analyze the amount of time and resources that can be saved using different platforms. Then, compare that with the cost of purchasing, installing, and maintaining the new systems. That will tell you whether sales intelligence is worth the investment. Usually, the answer is yes."", '3. Investigate key features.', ""Sales managers often tell me they're reluctant to adopt sales intelligence platforms because the tools aren't intuitive. They may have watched a demo video or presentation and come away feeling more confused than they were to begin with. If you've experienced this, know that the fault probably lies more with the sales rep who led the demo than with the product itself. Have patience and seek out the features that are relevant to your organization."", ""Sales intelligence is critical to your company's growth.

"", ""Now body language expert Judi James has revealed the key signs to look out for if you're concerned someone is being economical with the truth. "", ""While she warns that there is 'no set formula' for spotting a liar, recognising some of the signs can help you root out a fibber. "", '\'Forget all those claims of ""tells"" and other body language giveaways that reveal when someone is being economical with the truth. ', ""'A bad liar might blush and sweat and show physical signs of agitation like fidgeting,' she explained. "", ""'But a practised liar can easily deliver a lie while looking cool, calm and confident. "", '\'Despite the fact there are no ""one-size-fits-all"" symptoms to spot, the following tips should help alert you to the fact that someone’s not being totally honest with you.\'', 'The big pause: Lying is quite a complex process for the body and brain to deal with. First your brain produces the truth which it then has to suppress before inventing the lie and the performance of that lie. ', 'This often leads to a longer pause than normal before answering, plus a verbal stalling technique like ‘Why do you ask that?’ rather than a direct and open response.', 'The eye dart: Humans have more eye expressions than any other animal and our eyes can give away if we’re trying to hide something. ', 'When we look up to our left to think we’re often accessing recalled memory, but when our eyes roll up to our right we can be thinking more creatively. Also, the guilt of a lie often makes people use an eye contact cut-off gesture, such as looking down or away.', 'The lost breath: Bending the truth causes an instant stress response in most people, meaning the fight or flight mechanisms are activated. ', 'The mouth dries, the body sweats more, the pulse rate quickens and the rhythm of the breathing changes to shorter, shallower breaths that can often be both seen and heard.', 'Overcompensating: A liar will often over-perform, both speaking and gesticulating too much in a bid to be more convincing. These over the top body language rituals can involve too much eye contact (often without blinking!) and over-emphatic gesticulation.', 'The poker face: Although some people prefer to employ the poker face, many assume less is more and almost shut down in terms of movement and eye contact when they’re being economical with the truth.', 'The face hide: When someone tells a lie they often suffer a strong desire to hide their face from their audience. This can lead to a partial cut-off gesture like the well-know nose touch or mouth-cover.', 'Self-comfort touches: The stress and discomfort of lying often produces gestures that are aimed at comforting the liar, such as rocking, hair-stroking or twiddling or playing with wedding rings. We all tend to use self-comfort gestures but this will increase dramatically when someone is fibbing.', 'Micro-gestures: These are very small gestures or facial expressions that can flash across the face so quickly they are difficult to see. Experts will often use filmed footage that is then slowed down to pick up on the true body language response emerging in the middle of the performed lie. ', 'The best time to spot these in real life is to look for the facial expression that occurs after the liar has finished speaking. The mouth might skew or the eyes roll in an instant give-away.', 'Heckling hands: The hardest body parts to act with are the hands or feet and liars often struggle to keep them on-message while they lie. ', 'When the gestures and the words are at odds it’s called incongruent gesticulation and it’s often the hands or feet that are telling the truth.', 'Judi James is supporting Macmillan Cancer Support’s new Murder Mystery fundraising game Whodunnit? and says learning how to lie might help if you decide to take part. ', ""'While I don’t usually condone lying, this is the perfect opportunity to try your hand at being economical with the truth,' she said. "", 'Convince yourself first: The brain likes to see the whole manufactured story which it can then perform using body language. Don’t just think of the transcript, visualise the whole story including all the smallest details.', 'Visualisation is the nearest you’ll get to making the lie reality and that helps make your body language signals congruent.', 'Relax: To combat the fight/flight response, breathe out slowly and deliberately to relax your muscles, especially the ones in your shoulders, arms and hands. Keep your vocal tone a little lower - lying can make us more shrill.', 'Slow your blink rate: Fibbing often causes a give-away accelerated blink rate. Slow your own down a little, as this will help create reassurance in your audience.', 'Keep busy: If you’re not very good at lying, try to keep busy when you perform the lie. Actors call this a ‘bit of business’ which is when less competent actors continue washing up or potting plants while being quizzed rather than struggling with their body language. Sip a cup of tea etc. ', 'It might look rude but it can be better than over-sharing in terms of your body language giveaways!', 'Tell the truth first: In an emergency such as: ‘Do you like my new hair cut?’ or ‘Am I the best lover you’ve ever had?’ it can help if you expel the truth first. For example, ‘It looks terrible!’ or ‘No you’re the worst!’ followed by ‘Only joking, of course you’re wonderful!’', 'Macmillan Cancer Support’s new Murder Mystery fundraising game ‘Whodunnit?’ takes place on Saturday 25th March.

She also retired. Last month, I spoke with her about how she was able to retire, despite the fact that she only graduated from college about seven years ago. JP (a pen name she goes by on her blog, TheMoneyHabit.org) was able to retire because of her high earnings, lofty savings goals and disciplined investment techniques. Her investment strategies are part of what allowed her to build a net worth of about $2.25 million. ', 'With less than a week left in the year, so many of us are setting goals for the new year, which includes figuring out an investment plan for 2017. Deciding on investment strategies or goals can help us figure out what we want our long-term financial picture to look like, and shape our budget for the coming year. When laying out an investing plan, who better to learn from than a woman whose investments boast high returns, and who retired before 30? In our Q&A, JP discusses her personal 2017 investment plan, and provides useful insights for investors looking to build their nest egg more aggressively. This interview has been edited for brevity.', ""Maya Kachroo-Levine: You've had investments of over $1 million yield a 13% return ($130,000) in just one year. Can you speak to your investment strategy that year, and can you walk us through your 2016 investment strategy?"", 'JP Livingston: My investment strategy for several years has been a twist on a broadly discussed strategy to go long on equities.', ""Many financial experts (those who aren't compensated for getting you to invest a certain way) will tell you that if you are young and in the wealth accumulation phase of your life, to consider parking your money in a low-cost index fund, for example, Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)."", ""There are a few key arguments for this strategy. First, it's a nice hedge against inflation because the companies in the index are presumably raising their prices with inflation; since companies are valued on a multiple of revenue or profit, this will be captured in the growth of the stock market."", ""Secondly, and most importantly, is that it's hard to argue with its results. The compound annual growth rate for stocks on the S&P Index for the last 30 years has been 11%. There are very few if any opportunities available to us regular individual investors that can top that kind of return for the risk. (Note: you'll get an entirely different view from hedge funds or mutual funds. They believe they can beat market returns and so they charge high fees for their time and efforts. A few of them are worth it. Most of them are not)."", 'Kachroo-Levine: What are you planning on changing about your strategy in 2017?', 'Livingston: As a retiree, steady cash flow is going to matter more to me than it has in the past. There are only two ways to make money: appreciation and income. Stocks, for example, are about appreciation you make very little money on a regular basis (usually a puny 1%-2% in dividends), but a year or two or three later, you can sell it for much more than you paid and pocket the difference. A heavily appreciation-based strategy, like going 100% into index funds, will no longer meet my needs.', 'Income-based strategies, by contrast, put a steady paycheck in the spotlight. Bonds are generally purchased for the interest they provide. Sure they can appreciate or depreciate in value, but the bulk of your return from a bond comes from the monthly or quarterly dividend it pays.', ""I have a few years to build myself an income-based strategy, as I still have some deferred compensation coming from my old employer, but I'm looking to add one or two rental properties to my portfolio in 2017. Interest rates are still fairly low so it's not a bad time to be a borrower. I would also look at adding more bonds to my portfolio (specifically leveraged municipal bond funds; the leverage juices returns and municipal bonds are tax exempt), but I do not want to buy bonds right now, as the Fed has signaled a plan to increase interest rates (and even raised them just a week ago)."", 'Kachroo-Levine: What are your financial/investment goals for 2017? What are your priorities?', ""Livingston: As I am newly retired, my main priority is transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year. I'm on the lookout for a rental property or two to take advantage of low interest rates and which will provide some much-needed steady income. In some parts of the country like San Francisco, rental properties are actually negative cash flow exercises and are predicated on appreciation. In some areas, it will throw off 6%-7% or more in income each year and fit my income needs. Real estate is hyperlocal like that."", 'Kachroo-Levine: What are the key philosophies that help shape your investment strategy?', ""Livingston: I feel I've gotten pretty far on just two things.First, don't be afraid to say you don't know."", ""People get really weird and insecure when it comes to money. We're all lifelong learners. I have to admit I don't know basic things all the time. For example, while I've read quite a bit about real estate investment, I'm constantly finding myself with a giant question mark as I apply those concepts to my first live investments. My priority though is to make money and learn, not to impress people."", ""Second: Don't give up until you really feel you understand something.  Finally, my other silver bullet question is to ask What are the arguments against it? or What are the three things that could break this strategy? There's no free lunch. Every strategy has some vulnerability."", 'Kachroo-Levine: What advice can you offer for novice investors in 2017? Specifically, if you were speaking to people who had never invested beyond a 401(k) or IRA, what would you say to them?', 'Livingston: You are in such an exciting place, because there is low-hanging fruit all around you. A few things:', ""1. Money management is an incremental game, not a winner-take-all game. That means every tweak you make has a noticeable impact on your money, and it means you don't have to choose between going whole hog or absolute zero. You can devote however much time and effort you have and get proportional results and new ideas to employ."", '2. Momentum matters most. Start by joining a few interesting communities and blogs and read a little bit a few times a week. Cruise around on the Reddit Personal Finance forum. Investment is only painful or boring when you try to cram too much too fast, or you go find a dry, educational source and force feed yourself the information.', ""Momentum is the most important piece when you start any new project. Too many people think Alright, it's time to do this investment stuff and go and buy some highly rated book on Amazon to start their education. That's such a self-defeating way to start. Is that how you got into skiing, or guitar or interpretive Celtic dance? Has that kind of textbook strategy ever succeeded in firing up your passion?"", 'Kachroo-Levine: For those seeking early retirement, can you share why your investments are so crucial to your early retirement journey?', 'Livingston: Your nest egg is like an entire extra employee doing work for you, an employee that gets better and stronger and eventually eclipses you.', 'Say you make $100,000 pre-tax and save $30,000 a year. Once your nest egg is three times your salary, or $300,000, at a 10% return it will generate as much as you slaving a whole year to put away has accomplished.', ""At 10-times your salary and a 10% return, it is throwing off more money than you make in an entire year. You could be sitting on the beach drinking Mai Tais and still see a year's worth of salary come in just from your investments. Of course, you can't guarantee consistent 10% returns, but you have a long-term bet that you can achieve during your accumulation phase by investing in low-cost index funds."", 'More on Forbes: ']",How A 28-Year-Old Who Retired With A $2 Million Net Worth Is Investing In 2017,Check out exactly what her investing strategy looks like.,,,,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': None, 'spoilerPublisher': None}",['transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year'],"[[[12, 55], [12, 179]]]",['passage']

You see the smiling picture perfect family photos on Facebook and think to yourself, I bet they don’t fight about what kind of cereal to buy. You see other parents and wonder if they were up until 2 a.m. bickering about whose turn it was to get up with the baby. You see cute couples at the park on the weekend, pushing their toddlers in the swings, and doubt they have ever gone through the low-grade suckiness that you’re in right now.', 'Well, I can assure you that they have. We all have.

You will fight about whether to shop at Walmart or Costco, about whether your son needs a haircut, and whether your Aunt Josie is a racist or just an idiot. You will argue late into the night about whether to sign your daughter up for dance lessons or the soccer team. You will have drop-down, drag-out brawls about whether the toilet seat should be left up or down. And you will give each other the silent treatment for two days after one of you suggests that your mother might be a little ""needy.""', 'There will be anger.', 'In fact, you might scare yourself with the depth of blind rage that you feel when you see his socks on the floor or hear her loud chewing. You might want to smother him with a pillow when he snores blissfully as you get up in the middle of the night—again!—to feed the baby, get the toddler a drink of water, or calm the big kid after a scary dream. You might nearly lose your fucking mind when she runs out of gas—again!—and you need to leave a work meeting early and drive 60 minutes round-trip to pick her up.', 'There will be score-keeping.', 'You will tally up who slept less and who worked longer hours. You will keep track of who changed the last diaper and whose turn it is to control the remote. You measure who spends more hours chauffeuring the kids to soccer practice and ballet lessons, and who spends more hours working in a dead-end job that pays the bills and puts food on the table. You will keep score of the number of socks on the floor, dirty dishes in the sink, and toilet paper rolls unchanged.', 'And there will be hard times.', 'And not the romantic hypothetical hard times that you imagined before you had kids, the kind that involve short fights followed by steamy make-up sex. No. Marriage is really fucking hard sometimes.', 'But here’s something else no one might have told you: It’s OK that marriage is hard.', 'Because even with the fighting and the anger and the difficult times, marriage is pretty fucking great. The truth is, some of the most amazing things in life—marriage and parenting among them—are really hard work. Marriage is not all heart-shaped rainbows and diamonds made from unicorn poop. Marriage is not skipping in the park together before having porn star sex in the middle of the afternoon. And marriage is not one of those cheesy status updates on Facebook with words like ""soul mates"" and ""#soblessed.""', 'Marriage is hard work, and there will be difficult times now and then. Because when you share your freaking life with someone else—raising a family and building careers, paying taxes and choosing Netflix shows—it is impossible not to get bogged down in the muck now and then.', 'But you will get through it. You will remember that you’re on the same team. You will fight, and then you will forgive. You will compromise. You will get therapy if you need to. You will take a deep breath, flip each other off, and then laugh at yourselves.', 'So fear not, you are not alone. Marriage is hard for everyone now and then. And making it through those sucky stretches might even make your marriage better.

But the latest crop of gadgets are seen as more promising, thanks to their much-improved graphics, head-tracking abilities and more."", ""Few have watched virtual reality evolve as closely as the companies building the hardware that powers it. TIME sat down with Frank Azor, general manager of the Dell-owned gaming PC manufacturer Alienware, and Nelson Gonzalez, Alienware's cofounder and former CEO, to discuss what they have learned about VR and where they believe it's headed. Below are the key highlights from our conversation."", 'Virtual reality will get more physical', ""Anyone who's seen or tried the HTC Vive knows that some physical activity is involved. The Vive and its two controllers are equipped with sensors that allow players to swing a virtual golf club or wield an imaginary paintbrush."", ""But what systems like the Vive or PlayStation VR currently lack is a sense of touch. Although it may look like you're swinging a golf club, the device in your hand still feels like a video game controller. (The Oculus Rift doesn't yet support any motion controllers, although the company plans to launch such devices later in 2016.) This is going to be one of the first areas in which virtual reality will improve, says Gonzalez."", '""The next evolution of VR would be where you participate physically in that VR world,"" Gonzalez said. ""And not just sitting down; if you\'re a quarterback, you actually get to throw a football, and you can interface with the team. So that kind of stuff, it\'s there, it\'s going to happen.""', 'Incorporating better touch controls will only be the start. Azor believes future VR devices could refine concepts first introduced as far back as 1962 with the Sensorama , which incorporated elements like wind and smells.', '""Headsets today are doing an excellent job at catering to your visual senses, and a little bit of audio as well,"" said Azor, also Alienware\'s fourth employee. ""Well that\'s just two of the senses . . . Once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual piece begins to fade.""', ""It's unclear exactly how — and if — technologies like those Azor described will ever take shape. But some companies are certainly trying. Leap Motion, a startup which launched a motion-sensing camera for computers in 2013, is now building technology for interacting with VR environments without a controller. Startup Thalmic Labs also makes an armband capable of controlling electronic devices through gestures that works with the Rift."", 'VR is an industry-wide effort', 'The Oculus Rift will likely be remembered as the first modern virtual reality headset. But it takes more than just one device to impact the industry in a meaningful way, says Azor.', 'Azor draws comparisons to the way the gaming industry developed over the past decade. PCs became better equipped to deliver high-end gaming experiences as companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia developed more powerful chips and graphics processors. Games became more accessible on PCs as companies like Steam created platforms for easily buying and browsing content.', '""Everyone rallied around [the PC gaming] industry and now we have what we have today,"" he said. ""VR is the same type of thing; no one company can solve all of the problems.""', ""A wireless Rift or Vive won't happen soon"", ""There are two classes of virtual reality devices available today: cheaper, portable devices like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard, and beefier, expensive systems that offer more immersive experiences like the Rift and the Vive. The former plug into your smartphone to deliver VR that's wireless and convenient, while the latter must be tethered to a PC to power their higher-end performance."", ""It's unlikely that we'll see a high-performance device like the Rift go wireless anytime soon, mostly because wireless technology isn't advancing at the same pace as VR hardware."", '""By the time we solve that, as an industry we\'re going to want to give you version two of the product, which is going to become the new benchmark,"" Azor said. ""Wireless technology is on a different schedule, that\'s where the issue comes in . . . The latest and greatest will be wired for a fair amount of time moving forward.""']",3 Things To Know About the Future of Virtual Reality,We spoke with the team at gaming PC brand Alienware about what's next for VR.,"Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive, Alienware Oculus ready PCs, Alienware interview, virtual reality, vr","['data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==', 'https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/gettyimages-511577070.jpg?w=1100&quality=85', 'https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/gettyimages-511577070.jpg?w=720']",http://time.com/4324598/alienware-interview-virtual-reality/?xid=time_socialflow_facebook,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Virtual reality will get more physical, will become and industry-wide effort, and a wireless Rift or Vive won’t happen soon. #StopClickBait', 'spoilerPublisher': 'Stop Clickbait - Gaming'}","['Virtual reality will get more physical', 'VR is an industry-wide effort', ""A wireless Rift or Vive won't happen soon""]","[[[4, 0], [4, 38]], [[11, 0], [11, 29]], [[15, 0], [15, 41]]]",['multi']

The city of San Fernando holds a passion play, culminating in the actual nailing of at least three devotees to wooden crosses in front of spectators. The Catholic Church has tried to dissuade followers from the practise and the Department of Health suggests participants should get a Tetanus shot and use sterilised nails.', 'Bunny killing: New Zealand', 'Fluffy rabbits may be synonymous with spring birth and joy but in Central Otago, New Zealand they are classed as crop destroying pests. An annual competition, now in its 26th year, recruits teams of hunters to participate in a 24 hour ‘shoot-off’ with the aim of killing as many bunnies as possible. The record currently stands at 23,000.', 'Clay pot throwing: Corfu', 'As church bells ring to mark the end of mass on Easter Saturday, residents of Corfu hurl clay pots off their balconies to loudly celebrate that death has been beaten by the Resurrection.

It was adopted by the islanders and applied to the most important day in their calendar.', 'Inter-church rocket war: Chios', ""Churches across Greece celebrate midnight mass with a fireworks display but the island of Chios takes it to the next level with two rival churches engaging in a ‘rocket war’ or Rouketopolemos. The parishes of St. Mark's and Panaghia Ereithiani are built on hilltops 400 metres from each other and they fire hundreds of homemade rockets at the opposition’s belfry throughout the night. Direct hits to the bell tower are counted the next morning when the winner is declared."", 'Hill burning: Texas', 'Residents of Fredericksburg dress up as Easter Bunnies, pioneers and Comanches and parade through their tiny town before setting the hills surrounding it on fire. As the fires blaze the towns’ lights are lowered as part of the Easter Fires Pageant. The ceremony began in 1847 to celebrate the peace accord signed between German settlers and Native Americans.', 'Sprinting Virgin Mary: Italy', 'The procession of La Madonna Che Scappa (The Dashing Madonna) is held on Easter Sunday in Sulmona, in the Abruzzo region of Southern Italy. Followers carry statues of the Risen Christ, Saint John and Saint Peter to the Church of San Filippo Neri to announce the news of the Resurrection to the mourning Madonna of Loreto. After persuasion from the saints the Madonna slowly moves out and then suddenly dashes to meet her son, with the sound of firecrackers accompanying her sprint.', 'Ultra omelette: France', 'Villagers in Haux, Gironde embark on their yearly quest to feed all 1,000 residents with a giant omelette on Easter Monday. On a hand built fire in the town square chefs use 5,000 eggs and 110 pounds of bacon, onion, and garlic to create the 10 ft wide dish. The village feast has only been an annual event for 30 years but many trace it back to a tale that Napoleon demanded a giant egg dish be prepared for his troops as they passed through the countryside. ', 'Wet Monday: Slovakia', 'On Wet Monday dedicated men follow the ancient tradition of dumping a bucket of cold water over an unsuspecting young woman when she answers her front door. This Slovak gem is said to bless the soaked individual with fertility and strength.

Wells Fargo data show that of those who are saving, half are putting away 6% of their income or more.', ""What we're not so hot at, according to many of these same surveys, is investing. Many of us are frightened or confused by the topic and even inclined to put our money in a sock and call it a day. That's a problem, because investing the money you save is nearly as important as saving it in the first place."", 'Here are five crucial moves Millennials can make to overcome their investing anxieties.', '1. Get an education', ""At least this one will be free. Investing is understandably scary. Until you learn what you're doing, it feels an awful lot like gambling in Vegas without the free drinks."", ""There are plenty of resources to guide you through the basics; you just have to put in the time. Khan Academy is a good place to start, as is NerdWallet's guide on how to invest in stocks. Morningstar has a good, if slightly dated, investing classroom, and online brokers often have a ton of beginner-focused educational materials on their websites."", '2. Say hello to risk', ""Risk is kind of like that friend who regularly cancels plans but always comes through in a pinch. There might be heartache in the day-to-day, but in the long run, you'll be glad you stuck it out."", ""In investing, more risk means the potential for more reward. Investments that require you to take on risk, like stocks, have to offer you a premium for doing so. Could you lose money and never collect that premium? Sure, but that's unlikely when you're in it for the long-term. "", ""History illustrates this: A portfolio of 100% stocks had an average annual return of 10.1% between 1926 and 2015, according to a study by Vanguard. A portfolio of 100% bonds returned roughly half that, averaging 5.4%. To put that into real-money terms, if you invested $5,000 for 50 years at a 10.1% return, you'd have $614,000. At a 5.4% return, you'd have just $69,000."", ""But a 2015 study from BlackRock found that Millennials might have as much as 70% of their money in cash, meaning a savings account, a pillowcase, old sneakers. At today's historically low interest rates, it's all roughly the same. That $5,000 becomes just $8,000 at a 1% return; in your shoe, it stays $5,000. Factor in inflation   a force that Millennials may soon notice for the first time in their adult lives   and you're actually losing money."", '3. Take that risk through index funds', 'About 70% would be a reasonable stock allocation for your retirement portfolio   and even that might be on the low side. At this age, you should have most of your long-term savings invested in stocks. The best way to do that is not by dumping your money into Apple stock, but with low-cost index and exchange-traded funds.', ""Those funds pool investor money to buy many different investments in one swoop. You can buy a couple of funds that hold the stock of U.S. companies, one that holds international companies and one that holds emerging-markets companies and you'll be reasonably diversified."", ""You can learn more about building a diversified portfolio in NerdWallet's piece on investing in your 20s."", '4. Put a lid on fees', ""You can't control the ups and downs of the stock market. What you can mostly control are investing costs   fees charged by your index funds (called expense ratios), administrative fees in your 401(k) and transaction fees incurred when you buy and sell investments."", ""Every dollar that goes to these costs is a dollar that reduces your returns. Keep transaction costs down by limiting unnecessary trading and using commission-free and no-transaction-fee funds. Most brokers will have a list of both types of funds. If an index fund's expense ratio is more than 0.25%, you can likely do better with another."", '5. Use a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k)', 'Contributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA are made with pre-tax dollars; you pay taxes when you take distributions in retirement. But you can also pay taxes now and spare your future self the burden by choosing a Roth IRA (check Roth contribution limits to gauge your eligibility) or the Roth version of your 401(k), if your employer offers that option.', ""Why choose a Roth? If your income is lower now than it will be later   a likely scenario for many young professionals   you're locking in at lower tax rate. And because you're not getting a tax benefit now, you get to pull out the money   both your contributions and investment growth   tax free in retirement.

', 'The verdict? Good news first! Eating more nuts, legumes, plant sterols (molecules found in plants) and olive oil helps lower blood cholesterol.', 'The bad news? Discretionary foods (aka junk) raise blood cholesterol, especially bad cholesterol (called LDL). Eating less lowers it.', ""Do you know your blood cholesterol level? If you don't, ask your GP to check it. Over a third of Australian adults have high cholesterol."", '1. Eat legumes ', 'Legumes and pulses, including baked beans, kidney beans, chick peas, lentils and split peas, can help lower cholesterol levels.', 'The most recent Australian Health Survey found fewer than one in five Australians ate them on the day of the survey.', 'The results of 26 randomised control trials (the gold standard of research trials), which included 1,037 people who had either normal or high cholesterol levels, were added together. ', 'The data showed LDL cholesterol was reduced by 5 percent in response to eating 130 grams of pulses per day. ', 'This is equivalent to one small can or about a third of a 400 gram (large) can of baked beans.', 'Pulses are high in vegetable protein and fibre. They lower blood cholesterol in a number of ways. ', 'The soluble and insoluble fibres assist with lowering cholesterol absorption in the gut, while they promote growth of beneficial gut bacteria in the large bowel.', ""Legumes and pulses take longer to digest compared to processed foods. This means you tend to eat less when they're part of a meal."", '2. Eat plant sterols, margarines and spreads ', 'Plant sterols, or phytosterols, are chemically similar to blood cholesterol and are found in some plant foods, including nuts. ', 'They are concentrated from plant sources and then added to some commonly eaten foods such as margarines, spreads or milk.', 'Plant sterols compete with two other types of cholesterol for absorption from the gut: pre-made cholesterol, which is found in some foods like prawns, and cholesterol, which is made in your liver. ', ""This 'competition' process lowers the total amount of cholesterol that eventually ends up in your blood."", 'A review concluded that two grams of plant sterols a day leads to an 8-10 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol.', 'The type of fat the plant sterols are mixed with is important. ', 'A meta-analysis of 32 randomised control trials, involving around 2,100 people, found bigger reductions in total cholesterol (a mix of good and bad types) and LDL cholesterol when plant sterols were added to margarines or spreads derived from canola or rapeseed oil, rather than sunflower or soybean oil.', '3. Eat nuts ', 'Nuts are high in protein and fat, but the amounts of polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and saturated fat vary. ', 'In a review of 25 intervention trials, eating approximately 67g of nuts a day (about half a cup) led to a 5.1 percent reduction in total cholesterol and 7.4 percent for LDL.', ""It didn't matter what type of nuts people ate; the more nuts, the bigger the cholesterol reduction. "", 'People with higher LDL cholesterol at baseline or who were not overweight had a bigger improvement. ', 'One caution is that half a cup of nuts contains about 400 calories (1600kJ), so you need to eat nuts instead of another food, or eat less each day but have them every day.', '4. Use olive oil ', 'Olive oil is a major component of the Mediterranean diet and the predominant source of fat. Olive oil contains a high proportion of monounsaturated fat.', ""More than 80 percent of olive oil's healthy compounds (called phenolic compounds) are lost during the refining process, so less refined varieties, such as virgin olive oil, are a better choice."", 'A review of eight trials that included 350 people consuming high phenolic olive oil found medium effects on lowering blood pressure and small effects on lowering oxidised LDL (a type of LDL), with no significant effects on total or LDL cholesterol.', 'In contrast, another trial randomly selected over 7,400 men and women at high risk of heart disease to follow three diets: the Mediterranean diet plus extra-virgin olive oil, or Mediterranean diet plus nuts, or a control diet (low fat). ', 'After 4.8 years follow-up, those in both the olive oil and nut groups had a 30 percent lower risk of heart attack, stroke or death from heart disease compared to controls.', 'In a recent trial, 47 men and women were randomised to substitute 4.5 percent of their usual foodintake of olive oil or butter for five weeks, and then crossed over to the other group for another five weeks. ', 'Researchers found total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher after consuming butter compared to olive oil.', 'The reduction was biggest in those who had high blood cholesterol to start with. Switching to a healthier spread makes sense for those with high cholesterol.', '5. Avoid junk food ', 'In our study, we found people were able to make a number of smaller changes across a range of the foods that lower blood cholesterol levels, including increasing nuts, soy foods and plant sterols.', 'But the biggest change people made was cutting back on energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods (junk foods) and eating a wider variety of healthy foods. ', 'The benefits of making these changes? They lowered their cholesterol, lost weight and lowered their blood pressure.', ""A big study examined changes in diet quality scores and heart disease risk in 29,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and 51, 000 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2010). "", ""After four years of follow-up almost 11,000 people had a heart disease 'event'."", 'Those who had the biggest improvement in their diet quality score had a 7-8% lower risk.

But two nasty surprises have been discovered which may cause owners of the iPhone 7 to regret their purchase...', '‘Great Features’ and ‘Nasty Surprises’ are my regular columns investigating the latest software and hardware for the best features / biggest problems hidden behind the headlines.', 'Nasty Surprise #1: Goodbye Sapphire?', 'The first concern comes courtesy of popular YouTube channel JerryRigEverything. The famously diligent test site ran the iPhone 7 through the durability tests and claims Apple has ditched its premium sapphire glass from both the new home button and the camera lens:', 'The revelation comes after JerryRigEverything used hardness picks to determine the makeup of both surfaces on the Mohs’ scale of mineral hardness. Previously his tests on the iPhone 6S confirmed the presence of sapphire, but this time both the new home button and larger camera of the iPhone 7 scratched easily using picks that do not damage sapphire.', 'He concludes: ""we know for sure that it is regular glass and not sapphire.""', 'And here’s where it gets interesting, because Apple still advertises that both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as using sapphire (which is considerably more expensive than toughened glass) on the home button and camera lens. Given the new iPhones are marketed as more durable than ever this would be a major let down. I have put these claims to Apple and will update when/if the company responds.', 'Note: As JerryRigEverything has not tested the iPhone 7 Plus we cannot make assumptions here. Being the more expensive model, it’s possible sapphire is still used there.', 'Nasty Surprise #2: New Home Button, New Limitations', 'The controversies around the new home button continue as well following a discovery by Myke Hurley, eagle eyed founder of RelayFM, who spotted the button only responds to capacitive touch not pressure.', 'This means the button will not react should you be wearing standard gloves since there is no response anymore to physical movement. As he points out, if you want to test this for yourself then put some material (such as your shirt/t-shirt) over the button and try pressing.', 'That’s right, you get nothing. Hardly ideal when winter and you need to wear gloves.', 'There are a couple of ways around this. Firstly you can invest in ‘touchscreen gloves’ which use conductive thread to transfer the mild electrical charge in your skin to which capacitive touchscreens respond (note that’s a bogus claim that these don’t work, but I’ve tried two pairs and they do).', ""Secondly you can setup AssistiveTouch, though that's primarily used for when an old physical home button is broken outside warranty. Feel free to insert your joke of choice here."", 'Designed By Apple - For Apple?', 'All of which leaves me in two minds about the iPhone 7’s biggest external changes and who they really help the most.', 'For example, the new home button kills a weak spot in iPhone design for Apple as the old physical button was notorious for going wrong - it saves on warranty claims. But the taptic engine required to simulate physical movement uses all the space vacated by the headphone jack (as the photo from iFixit illustrates below).', 'I’m not convinced many users would consider this the best way to utilise the additional space the headphone jack used. Personally a far bigger battery would’ve been top of my list.', 'Then there are little cost cutting omissions. If sapphire has indeed been dropped from the iPhone 7 then that is a notable one (sapphire is 5-10x more expensive than toughened glass). Meanwhile there are little packaging shortcuts such as the removal of the earphone case. Instead earphones with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are just wrapped around a piece of card.', 'This despite the fact iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus prices were increased compared to the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus in every country.', 'Yes there are good surprises in the new iPhones as well (most notably in the iPhone 7 Plus) but if you didn’t buy an iPhone 7 just yet, waiting a little longer for some answers is probably a good idea...', '___', 'More On Forbes', 'Apple iOS 10 Has 25 Great Secret Features', 'Apple iOS 10.0.1: Should You Upgrade?', 'Apple iPhone 7 Plus Has A Great Secret Feature', ""iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus: What's The Difference?"", ""iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 6S: What's The Difference?""]",Apple iPhone 7 Has Two Nasty Surprises,Apple's iPhone 7 has problems which may make customers regret upgrading...,,"['http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-18-at-01.51.18-1200x765.jpg?width=960', 'http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/599933512/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000', 'https://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-18-at-01.51.18-1200x765.jpg?width=640&height=434', 'http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/135313297429b8a66b069508000b1134?s=400&d=mm&r=g', 'http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-17-at-22.30.46.jpg?width=960', 'http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-17-at-21.08.17-1200x658.jpg?width=960']",http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/09/17/apple-iphone-7-home-button-problems/#6edff832541d,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'No sapphire glass and capacitive home button', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}","['#1: Goodbye Sapphire?', '#2: New Home Button, New Limitations']","[[[2, 15], [2, 36]], [[8, 15], [8, 51]]]",['multi']

Individual company cultures may be more unique today (conservative versus liberal, strict versus playful) but the need to examine and then fit into a new culture – whatever it may be – remains.', 'Dress for the job you want', 'Like business culture, business dress was once straightforward. Junior level professionals in the 90s could wear business casual, which consisted of khakis and polos for guys and slacks or skirts paired with nice blouses for women. However, by the time you reached a senior level, you were advised to take it up a notch with tailored suits and pricey shoes and accessories. Basing your appearance on that of the executives sent a very clear signal that you intended to climb the ladder quickly.

And now, the stakes are higher because your epic in-office rant won’t just be a legend passed down from employee to employee. Instead, it could be taped on a phone and broadcast on social media for perpetuity.

Here’s a few cities that may be the next location for the epic that GTA 6 will surely be.', 'There’s also been a lot of rumours that Rockstar has abandoned development work on GTA 6 to focus more on Grand Theft Auto online but it’s a given that the game will eventually come out.', 'However, that doesn’t mean there isn’t any talk about where the next GTA game might take place. We look at three possible locations where the game might be going in its sixth installment.', 'Tokyo:', 'As mentioned above, Tokyo could definitely be in with a shot at the next prime GTA location. With it’s intoxicating mix of tight streets and neon night-sky, it would showcase the visuals of the game and its graphical capabilities. A good indicator of this is by the different mods that have been released so far for the older GTA 5.', 'It would also make sense in a story-sense as Tokyo has a criminal underworld led by factions of the Yakuza. But is this too similar to the Hong Kong of Sleeping Dogs? Even though that was set in China, it does seem aesthetically alike. It would still be an interesting shift from West to East, however.', 'Chicago:', 'John Dillinger. Al Capone. Frankie Yale. The Windy City is known for its mirrored giant Bean sculpture as much as its violent past. Chicago used to be a town of blood and bullets and this would make a fitting context for a GTA game.', 'Especially in an updated fashion. It would also make sense being set in the U.S itself as GTA has also been a great parody of America as a country.', 'London:', 'It wouldn’t be new to the GTA series, but it would make more a welcome return. It would also make sense to go back in time like Vice City did. If GTA returns to London, it would most likely be that of a different era.', 'London would also be a perfect premise to stir up a lot more controversies that are common with the U.K and EU.', 'Where do you think the next GTA should be set? Let us know.']",3 Cities That Are Reportedly Being Considered For GTA 6,"The question remains for Rockstar's new release. Where will it be set? Tokyo? Chicago?

I know, but when a condiment is historically sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup just to make it taste good, we have a problem.

As living things, humans are still evolving. Since we became Homo sapiens, has evolution changed us in any way? Actually, yes."", 'Thousands of genes have evolved recently (in the last 40,000 years). Changes we are seeing include smaller brains (more efficient, not dumber), resistance to diseases, increases in ADHD and blue eyes. Yes, blue eyes. Genetic analysis says the first blue-eyed human appeared 6,000-10,000 years ago somewhere in the Black Sea region. For whatever reason, the phenotype became very popular (conferring a 5% greater chance for reproduction) and today about half a billion blue-eyed folk exist.', ""Another famous example is HgbS (sickling hemoglobin), a gene that makes humans immune to malaria. Malaria is the number one killer of humans, so it makes sense that a mutation eventually arose that makes human red blood cells resistant to the malaria parasites, and for the gene to rise in frequency in malaria-prone populations (sub-Saharan Africa). Unfortunately, the same gene also causes sickle cell anemia. We all have two copies of every gene in our body (one from mom, one from dad), and if one copy is the malaria-resistant mutant HgbS, you're fine, but if both are the mutant, you get sickle cell disease. The good news is that many other genes confer resistance to malaria, and we are also seeing leprosy and tuberculosis resistance genes appearing, too."", 'Another example is the gene for lactose tolerance. Primitive man would drink milk as a baby, and then never again, so the amount of lactase enzyme (which breaks down a common sugar in milk) would fall after a few years of age. Over time, however, humans have evolved so that certain populations will keep producing the enzyme into late adulthood. As expected, the lactose-tolerant trait appears most often in the regions where dairy farming arose first and became an important part of the diet (Caucasians). Tolerance for milk is supposed to have evolved only 3,000-8,000 years ago, and is now found in nearly 95% of North Europeans.', ""Our mouths are changing, too. They are getting smaller and more bullet-shaped. Our teeth aren't quite changing as fast, which is why orthodontics and wisdom teeth removal still exist ... for now. More and more people are being born without wisdom teeth, or have their wisdom teeth erupt later if at all. Wisdom teeth were useful before knives and cooking, when humans would probably lose molars to chewing hard food and needed the wisdom teeth as replacements. Today, 35% of people lack wisdom teeth, although the genes involved in this are unknown so we aren't quite sure why this is happening yet."", ""Darwin's theory of natural selection evolves."", 'So what will we look like 100,000 years from now, assuming we still exist that far in the future?

Ideas Have Consequences by Richard Weaver', 'Originally published in 1948, Ideas Have Consequences foresaw the corrosive influences of moral and cultural relativism decades before the Left harnessed those forces to undermine Western civilization. One of America’s greatest conservative intellectuals and an esteemed twentieth-century rhetorical scholar, Richard Weaver erected an intellectual fortress around Absolute Truth long before progressives mounted their frontal assault on notions of right versus wrong, good versus evil.', '2. The Road to Serfdom by F.A. Hayek', 'In the age of Bernie Sanders, today’s young generation of would-be socialists would do well to read Friedrich Hayek’s 1944 classic broadside against socialism, The Road to Serfdom. A member of the Austrian School of economics and a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, Hayek warned of the totalitarian realities of socialism’s conceits. As he put it elsewhere: ""A claim for equality of material position can be met only by a government with totalitarian powers.""', '3. The Closing of the American Mind by Allan Bloom', 'Long before anti-MILO rioters sparked violence at UC Berkeley, a University of Chicago professor named Allan Bloom lit academia ablaze with this 1987 classic taking the professoriate to task for eroding higher education curriculum with progressive pablum. A staunch defender of the classical ""canon"" of great works every thinking person must read, Bloom explained how the intellectual corruption of the humanities and arts led to an erasure of students’ understanding of the proper moral order that undergirds Western Civilization.', '4. A Choice Not an Echo by Phyllis Schlafly', 'The late great matriarch of modern conservatism, Phyllis Schlafly, did more to advance and win the battle of ideas than many young conservatives understand. The tip of her intellectual spear, A Choice Not an Echo, reshaped the contours of American conservatism and has sold an astounding three million copies since its release over a half-century ago. The original anti-establishment crusader, Schlafly’s book argued that conservatives must be willing to fight for a voice within the Republican Party’s establishment leadership and helped pave a path for Barry Goldwater’s nomination.', '5. Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman', 'Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman redefined the field of economics. In addition to being an intellectual titan, he was a sterling writer with a knack for distilling complex topics with wit and clarity. Any Nobel Prize winner who can string together a sentence like this deserves to be read: ""If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there’d be a shortage of sand.""', '6. A Conflict of Visions by Thomas Sowell', 'There are no ""bad"" Thomas Sowell books, so we could have easily recommended many of his other classics. But A Conflict of Visions crystalizes the stakes involved in the clash between conservative and progressive ideologies—and how radically different outcomes are when one side prevails over the other. One of America’s most lucid conservative economists, Sowell’s book draws upon everything from Rousseau to Hobbes to Adam Smith to illustrate the intellectual impulses that drive conservatives and progressives to think and act the way they do.', '7. Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn', 'Hailed as one of the greatest nonfiction books of the twentieth century, Gulag Archipelago is the first-person account of Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s eight years spent as a prisoner inside the Russian gulags for criticizing Stalin and the Soviet Communist system in his private letters. A winner of the Nobel Prize in literature, Solzhenitsyn’s ability to combine lyrical prose with piercing reportage of communism’s moral horrors are virtually without equal.']",7 Conservative Classics Every American Should Read,Here are seven conservative classics that should be on every American’s bookshelf.,"Breitbart News,Big Journalism,Conservative Classics",,,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': None, 'spoilerPublisher': None}","['1.

However, there are some foods and drinks that may make it easier to get a great night’s sleep.', 'Specific Foods That Can Affect Sleep', 'Researchers, including nutritionists and sleep experts, have conducted different types of studies to try to discover the best foods for sleep. While this research provides important clues, it’s not conclusive. In general, there’s a lack of direct evidence about specific foods that are good for sleep.', 'In addition, the range of varieties of cultivars of most foods means that their nutrient profile can be inconsistent. For example, some varieties of red grapes have high levels of melatonin while others have virtually none. Climate and growing conditions may further alter the nutrients in any particular food product.', 'That said, there are indications that certain foods can make you sleepy or promote better sleep. Sometimes this is based on a particular research study and in other cases on the underlying nutritional components of the food or drink.', 'Dietary choices affect more than just energy and sleepiness; they can play a major role in things like weight, cardiovascular health, and blood sugar levels just to name a few. For that reason, it’s best to consult with a doctor or dietician before making significant changes to your daily diet. Doing so helps ensure that your food choices support not just your sleep but all of your other health priorities as well.', 'Kiwi', 'The kiwi or kiwifruit is a small, oval-shaped fruit popularly associated with New Zealand even though it is grown in numerous countries. There are both green and gold varieties, but green kiwis are produced in greater numbers.', 'Kiwifruit possess numerous vitamins and minerals, most notably vitamins C and E as well as potassium and folate.', 'Some research has found that eating kiwi can improve sleep. In a study, people who ate two kiwis one hour before bedtime found that they fell asleep faster, slept more, and had better sleep quality.', 'It is not known for sure why kiwis may help with sleep, but researchers believe that it could relate to their antioxidant properties, ability to address folate deficiencies, and/or high concentration of serotonin.', 'Tart Cherries and Tart Cherry Juice', 'As the name indicates, tart cherries have a distinct flavor from sweet cherries. Sometimes called sour cherries, these include cultivars like Richmond, Montmorency, and English morello. They may be sold whole or as a tart cherry juice.', 'Several studies have found sleep benefits for people who drink tart cherry juice. In one study, people who drank two one-cup servings of tart cherry juice per day were found to have more total sleep time and higher sleep efficiency.', 'These benefits may come from the fact that tart cherries have been found to have above-average concentrations of melatonin, which is a hormone that helps regulate circadian rhythm and promote healthy sleep. Tart cherries may also have an antioxidant effect that is conducive to sleep.', 'Malted Milk and Nighttime Milk', 'Malted milk is made by combining milk and a specially formulated powder that contains primarily wheat flour, malted wheat, and malted barley along with sugar and an assortment of vitamins. It is popularly known as Horlick’s, the name of a popular brand of malted milk powder.', 'In the past, small studies found that malted milk before bed reduced sleep interruptions. The explanation for these benefits is uncertain but may have to do with the B and D vitamins in malted milk.', 'Milk itself contains melatonin, and some milk products are melatonin-enriched. When cows are milked at night, their milk has more melatonin, and this milk may be useful in providing a natural source of the sleep-producing hormone.', 'Fatty Fish', 'A research study found that fatty fish may be a good food for better sleep. The study over a period of months found that people who ate salmon three times per week had better overall sleep as well as improved daytime functioning.', 'Researchers believe that fatty fish may help sleep by providing a healthy dose of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, which are involved in the body’s regulation of serotonin. This study focused particularly on fish consumption during winter months when vitamin D levels tend to be lower.', 'Nuts', 'Nuts like almonds, walnuts, pistachios, and cashews are often considered to be a good food for sleep. Though the exact amounts can vary, nuts contain melatonin as well as essential minerals like magnesium and zinc that are essential to a range of bodily processes. In a clinical trial using supplements, it was found that a combination of melatonin, magnesium, and zinc helped older adults with insomnia get better sleep.', 'Rice', 'Studies of carbohydrate intake and sleep have had mixed results overall, but some evidence connects rice consumption with improved sleep.', 'A study of adults in Japan found that those who regularly ate rice reported better sleep than those who ate more bread or noodles. This study only identified an association and cannot demonstrate causality, but it supports prior research that showed that eating foods with a high glycemic index around four hours before bedtime helped with falling asleep.', 'At the same time, sugary beverages and sweets have been tied to worse sleep, so it appears that not all carbohydrates and high glycemic index foods are created equal. Additional research is necessary to fully identify the sleep-related effects of different carbohydrates.', 'The impact of carbohydrates on sleep may be influenced by what is consumed with them. For example, a combination of a moderate amount protein that has tryptophan, a sleep-promoting amino acid, and carbohydrates may make it easier for the tryptophan to reach the brain. Turkey is an example of a protein with high levels of tryptophan.']",Eat These Foods for Better Sleep,The Best Foods to Help You Sleep,,,https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/food-and-drink-promote-good-nights-sleep,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': None, 'spoilerPublisher': None}","['Kiwi', 'Tart Cherries and Tart Cherry Juice', 'Malted Milk and Nighttime Milk', 'Fatty Fish', 'Nuts']","[[[8, 0], [8, 4]], [[13, 0], [13, 35]], [[17, 0], [17, 30]], [[21, 0], [21, 10]], [[24, 0], [24, 4]]]",['multi']

Will he walk away in shame, or will he remain calm and continue talking to her in a confident, easy-going manner?', 'This is her way of gauging his interest in her and also a way of determining whether he is mentally and emotionally strong enough for a girl like her.', 'If a guy gives up at the first sign of resistance, most women will be turned off by his mental and emotional weakness as a man.""', '3. Allowing her to take control of the interaction', '""No matter how confident or challenging a woman might behave, she still dreams of meeting a guy who is more confident than her. A woman doesn’t want to be forced to control an interaction with a guy (i.e. call the shots, boss him around), but she will if she has to.', 'Controlling an interaction with a woman is not about bossing her around, being arrogant or being too assertive. Instead, you simply need to assume the role of the man and let her be the woman.

It’s a playbook we never signed up for and it’s only a game if both teams actually know they’re playing.', 'Nowhere in his advice does Dan tell his frustrated man-babies how to handle rejection with grace, because the advice is simply not to accept it.

Because regardless of your feelings on legalized pot, Colorado will leave you feeling absolutely magical.', ""If you're an urbanite, a mountaineer, a ski bum, a history nerd, an outdoor adventurer... you get the point... there is something for you in Colorado. And if you're not dazzled by the epic natural wonders Colorado has to offer, you might not have a soul."", 'Not convinced? Maybe these 19 reasons will prove that Colorado is the most magical state in America.', '1. Because with ""300 days of sunshine,"" Colorado is one of the sunniest places in America.', 'And who doesn\'t love a sunny day? The ""300 days of sunshine"" thing is actually a myth. According to the Colorado Climate Center, there\'s no technical definition of ""days of sunshine,"" so measuring it gets tricky. They go on, however, to state that Colorado only has 30-40 overcast days per year, leaving at least 300 days of partial sunshine. They estimate only about 115 days that would fit the classic definition of clear... but 300 days of partial sunshine, at the least, still sounds awesome.', '2. Being at a high altitude just makes things more fun.', 'Colorado has the highest average elevation in the country. The lowest point in Colorado, located at the Arikaree River, is 3,315 feet above sea level. The highest is Mt. Elbert, located at 14,433 feet above sea level. Denver, the state\'s capital, legitimately earns its nickname of ""Mile High City"" standing at an elevation of 5,280 feet high. At these elevations, the sun is stronger. You also could potentially get drunk faster.', ""3. Colorado is a beer-lover's happy place."", ""Colorado consistently ranks among the best craft brew states in America. The state has more than 200 breweries, including 130 microbreweries, according to USA Today's 2013 count. Denver itself has more than 20 breweries."", '4. Because, the Rockies.', ""Whether you're into skiing, hiking, climbing, driving or just looking at pretty scenery, the Rocky Mountains are easily one of America's greatest natural wonders. Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the most visited national parks, for good reason. Breathtaking views are guaranteed, whether the mountains are blanketed in snow or lush green trees."", '5. You can rock out surrounded by rocks at Red Rocks Amphitheater.', ""It's been called one of the best amphitheaters in America. If you can't get concert tickets, visiting by day and hiking a trail or having a picnic is a great way to experience Red Rocks."", '6. Or spend some heavenly time at Garden of the Gods.', 'As far as U.S. natural wonders go, this is a must see. The National Natural Landmark offers beautiful rock formations and other archeological wonders.', ""7. Or visit the Flatirons, which are some of the coolest looking foothills you'll ever see."", ""The Flatirons are located in Boulder and have a rich climbing history. They're cool to view from afar and the climbs themselves offer terrific views and some challenging routes."", ""8. Winding mountain roads are basically nature's roller coaster."", 'Well, nature provided the mountain. Man built the road. But still, driving up and then down a mountain is an experience every thrill-seeker should experience, and the Rockies are perfect for it. Try Loveland Pass for steep climbs, hairpin turns and views that will make both your stomach and jaw drop.', '9. Travel back in time and visit gold rush and mining towns.', ""These cool little old-school mining towns look like they're out of a movie (or Snow White, maybe?). Most people associate the gold rush with California, but let's not forget Pike's Peak and Colorado's role in the fun. Follow the Colorado Gold Trail and pass through gold and silver mine towns like Idaho Springs, Breckenridge and Black Hawk. Mine tours are also available in many towns as well."", ""10. Denver's homegrown burger chain, Smashburger, is beyond delicious."", ""While it's up for debate where the original smashburger came from, Smashburger as we know it today is Denver born and bred. Denver is also home to the first ever Chipotle... which is pretty cool, though you can eat Chipotle pretty much anywhere these days."", ""11. Or, if you're feeling really adventurous, you could always try Rocky Mountain Oysters."", 'Warning: Rocky Mountain Oysters are not actually oysters. They are bull testicles and they are a delicacy...we kid you not.', '11. Coors Field is not just a place to watch baseball.', ""The home of the Colorado Rockies is consistently ranked as one of the top ballparks in the country. And the ballpark's not just for fans -- the over-the-top stadium offers plenty to eat and drink, and sweeping views of Denver and the mountains beyond. Tickets start as low as $4, so it's a great deal."", ""12. Colorado's welcome signs are cooler than yours."", '13. Denver is mecca for all things delicious, fun and cheap.', ""Beer is cheap, ice cream is in abundance and the cost of living won't leave you totally broke. Denver is also near plenty of outdoor adventure, so urbanites can escape from the city whenever their hearts desire."", '14. And Boulder is a haven for crunchy types with no shortage of activity, and awesome proximity to nature, of course.', '15. Because you can walk into a recreational marijuana dispensary and buy marijuana, legally.', ""Both in-state residents and visitors (over 21-years-old) can shop at the dispensaries, though Coloradans can purchase more product than tourists. And these shops don't just sell weed... they sell marijuana-infused edibles, oils, beverages and more. If you fancy yourself a consumer of marijuana, you will be in heaven. Keep in mind, you can only smoke in private, buy from licensed dispensaries and cannot bring marijuana products out of the state."", '16. Colorado is home to the North American Aerospace Defense Command... And you know what they do, right?', 'They track Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, duh.', '17. Want some thrills? How about white water rafting? Zip lining? Ice climbing? Hang gliding?', ""The state is an adrenaline junkie's paradise."", '18. Because Colorado sets records... Zombie Crawl records, that is.', ""19. And, if you haven't figured it out yet, Colorado is paradise for the outdoorsy type."", ""You can't beat these numbers -- Colorado boasts four national parks, 42 state parks, 11 national forests, two national grasslands and eight national wildlife refuges.

108a14bb-5875-4969-a0ca-df1fa29c6c8d,50jlah,7 things we know about the new season of stranger things,reddit,"['+ READ ARTICLE', 'Netflix officially announced that a second season of Stranger Things will premiere in 2017. Until then you’ll have to hold onto your wrist rockets, but The Duffer Brothers did give Entertainment Weekly teasers about the show to get everyone all jacked up for the new season.', 'Watch the teaser above, and here’s what we know so far.', '1. The action’s going to pick back up in Fall of 1984. So plan accordingly by getting all your friends the correct walkie talkies to discuss the finer points of Steve’s hair.', 'It will be a continuation of the first season’s story. ""I think we talked like a larger time jump where the kids are older now and it’s a different decade,""Ross Duffer revealed to 2.""I think we talked like a larger time jump where the kids are older now and it’s a different decade,""Ross Duffer revealed to EW . ""That’s something we batted around from the very beginning. But for us, there’s still more story here, there’s still things that are unresolved."" These are the people coming right back at you, so you can continue to live life: Joyce, woman of light bulb chats (Winona Ryder); Mike (Finn Wolfhard), whose love for Eleven was huge; and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), the kid who says everything you can’t, but the writer-directors were cryptic about Eleven . ""We don’t know about Eleven,"" Ross Duffer says. ""We leave that up in the air."" Disappointingly, no mention of whether the show’s heartthrob Dr. Brenner lived to melt our hearts another day.', '3. Expect four brand new characters. ""There’s going to be a lot of new and interesting dynamics that we didn’t see in season 1,"" Matt Duffer says. In the teaser, we see the words ""The Lost Brother."" So fingers crossed Barb’s mom can lose one more kid the show can drop like a bad habit, in case that family didn’t endure enough misery.', 'There’s one more major influence that will inspire this season. Bringing the show’s 4.Bringing the show’s tally of cool guys the Duffer Brothers admire up to 6 million, the new season will have a heavy James Cameron influence. Matt Duffer explained why. ""I know movie sequels get a lot of s—, but the ones we look up to aspire to pivot and do something different,"" he says. ""There’s Temple of Doom, Aliens, Terminator 2. I guess a lot of this is James Cameron. But he’s brilliant. And I think one of the reasons his sequels are as successful as they are is he makes them feel very different without losing what we loved about the original. So I think we kinda looked to him and what he does and tried to capture a little bit of the magic of his work."" We’ll never let go, Barb. We’ll never let go', 'Courtesy of Netflix Stranger Things', '5. Good old monster-infested Hawkins won’t be the only location. Season two will open on another town, the creators reveal. (It’s conceivable that the Byers’ and co. wanted to have a new beginning in a town without terrifying government operatives at every turn, but given that adorable little William coughs up a slug at the end, they’re not escaping the past anytime soon.)', '6. Everyone will still have access to the Upside Down. Great news, in case they want to go hang with the throat snakes for a fun long weekend for the whole family. There will be more discussion of the otherworld and some loose ends will be tied and the creators even posed some questions because a good teacher never keeps a curiosity door locked. They assure us the show will answer some long-marinating questions. ""We obviously have this gate to another dimension, which is still very much open in the town of Hawkins. And a lot of questions there in terms of, if the Monster is dead, was it a singular monster? What else could be out there? We really don’t go in there much until they go in to find Will at the end. So we’ve opened up this doorway, and to us it’s exciting to talk about, like, what else is behind there? There’s a lot more mystery there to be solved.""', '7. It will be nine episodes instead of eight. This way, fans can spend nine hours without moving in front of the screen, because life is fair. ""We’re letting the story dictate it,"" says Matt. ""I think if it gets any longer, it gets unwieldy for us. We want to make sure it’s manageable and we want to be able to tell a movie-like story where it’s never treading water. We want it to have the same feel and pacing as season 1. I think if we extend it too much, it will have a very different feel.""']",7 Things We Know About the New Season of Stranger Things,"The Duffer Brothers reveal details about the second season of

It comes almost a year after the shocking suicide of a vet overwhelmed by grief at the plight of stray animals. The BBC's Cindy Sui explores this tragedy."", 'Perhaps veterinarian and animal lover Chien Chih-cheng was in the wrong job at the wrong time.', '""She often worked overtime, rarely took a proper lunch break, and sacrificed her holidays to give the dogs more attention and make their lives better,"" Winnie Lai, her colleague at a shelter for abandoned dogs in Taoyuan City, remembers.', ""As a graduate of Taiwan's top university with the highest score in a civil service examination, Ms Chien could have chosen a desk job at head office, but opted to personally care for the many pets abandoned each year in Taiwan."", ""The shelter's lobby was decorated with pictures of animals drawn by Ms Chien to encourage adoptions, but many of them were destined to be put down."", 'On 5 May last year, Ms Chien took her own life, using the same drug she used to put down animals. She said she wanted to help people understand what happens to strays in Taiwan.', 'Taiwan was gripped by anger and soul-searching in the weeks that followed, most of it focused on a life tragically cut short.', ""But people also asked why frontline workers in Taiwan's battle against pet abandonment were being put under so much pressure."", 'You might also be interested in', 'In an interview Ms Chien once did with a local TV station CTI, she described the first time she saw an animal put down.', '""I went home and cried all night,"" she said.', 'But it was media appearances like this that meant she came under personal attack. When it was revealed she had put down 700 dogs in two years, she was labelled the ""beautiful slaughterer"".', 'Shelter workers dreaded putting down the dogs, but Ms Chien and others saw this as a better end for the unwanted, ageing or difficult-to-adopt animals than leaving them at risk of disease in overcrowded shelters.', '""They called her a butcher... We are frequently scolded. Some people say we\'ll go to hell. They say we love to kill and are cruel,"" said Kao Yu-jie, one of her co-workers.', '""But people still abandon their dogs. You hear all kinds of reasons: their dog is too mean, or not mean enough, barks too much, or doesn\'t bark enough.""', 'High kill rate', 'Taiwan has two main problems when it comes to animal welfare: the number of pets being abandoned and the number of strays allowed to reproduce.', 'In reality, the situation has improved over the past decade thanks to increased public awareness and efforts by shelters and activists to discourage abandonment and encourage adoptions.', 'But the number of animals put down remains high and shelters are still underfunded and understaffed. The work is difficult and hours long. In some shelters, half the animals are killed.', 'In 2015 around 10,900 were put down. And about 8,600 shelter animals died last year from other causes, such as illness.', 'In the CTI interview, Ms Chien described the process of putting a dog down.', '""We first let it take a stroll and eat some snacks and talk to it. Then we take it into the \'humane room\'.', '""When you put it on the table, it\'s very scared and its whole body is shaking. But after we administer the drug, it leaves in three to five seconds. It no longer shakes. Actually, it\'s very sad.""', 'No psychological counselling was provided for the staff. Psychological support in this and other fields is practically unheard of in Taiwan.', 'The Taoyuan shelter actually had one of the lowest euthanasia rates and highest adoption rates of any shelter.', 'But a letter Ms Chien left behind when she killed herself suggested her concern for the welfare of the animals had consumed her. Her colleagues attest to this, although experts remind us that many and complex factors lie behind any suicide.', '""She put herself under a lot of pressure. She cared a lot about the animals and the pressure from the work affected her,"" said Ms Lai.', 'In the letter, Ms Chien wrote: ""I hope my departure will let all of you know stray animals are also life. I hope the government knows the importance of controlling the source [of the problem]... Please value life.""', 'The irony of her exhortation to value life was not lost on observers and blame was quick to be handed out.', 'Newspapers accused the government of ""murdering"" her, with many saying it failed to come up with effective ways to stamp out pet abandonment or prevent strays from reproducing.', 'Some accused ""higher-level bureaucrats"" of trying to convince the public that Ms Chien simply couldn\'t handle her work pressures.

Recently, however, two additional adjectives have worked their way into the Millennial description pool: stressed and sleepless .', 'The correlation between stress and sleep deprivation is becoming increasingly apparent in American society. NPR maintains that 60 million Americans are currently battling insomnia.', 'According to an American Psychological Association study titled Stress in America , more than 50 percent of Millennials report to having been kept awake at least one night over the course of the past month due to stress. This is comparable to only 37 percent of Baby Boomers and 25 percent of Matures.', 'Why does stress affect sleep? Stress is widely recognized as the body’s response to potentially harmful situations, whether real or imagined. Although the effects of stress most certainly vary from person to person, general reactions include quickened breathing, tightened muscles, spiked blood pressure, and an increased heart rate.', 'Fight or Flight or... Sleep?', 'These are, in short, all individual components of the body’s intrinsic and universally acknowledged ""fight-or-flight"" response. Many stressed out people have trouble falling asleep because they feel the weight of these symptoms most heavily at night.', 'Best-selling author Dr. Andrew Weil, who received his M.D. from Harvard University in 1968, is a huge advocate of the benefits of holistic breathing practices in combatting stress and anxiety. On his website , Dr. Weil writes:', '""Breathing strongly influences physiology and thought processes, including moods. By simply focusing your attention on your breathing, and without doing anything to change it, you can move in the direction of relaxation.""', 'Because the effects of stress include quick and shallow breaths that stem almost exclusively from the upper chest, perpetually stressed and anxious people are actually in the detrimental habit of under-breathing. Many stressed people are even known for subconsciously holding their breath.', 'That being said, mindful breathing practices are noticeably absent from the vast majority of Western medicine. Those most familiar with the relationship between breathing and the body tend to be yogis and practitioners of Eastern wellness methodologies.', 'How to Do The ""4-7-8′′ Exercise', 'Dr. Weil is an influential public supporter of a previously little-known breathing technique known as the ""4-7-8 exercise."" This trick, which began to capture national attention several years ago and has since been the subject of innumerable headlines, including one on Oprah.com , is shockingly simple, takes hardly any time, and can be done pretty much anywhere.', 'Here is how you do the exercise:', 'Place the tip of your tongue against the tissue ridge right above your upper front teeth. Keep it there for the remainder of the exercise. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound as you do so. Close your mouth and inhale slowly through your nose while mentally counting to four. Hold your breath for a mental count of seven. Exhale completely through your mouth for a mental count of eight. Make the same whoosh sound from Step Two. This concludes the first cycle. Repeat the same process three more times for a total of four renditions.', 'In a nutshell: breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight. You must inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. The four-count inhale allows chronic under-breathers to take in more oxygen. The seven-count hold gives the oxygen more time to thoroughly permeate the bloodstream, and the eight-count exhale slows the heart rate and releases a greater amount of carbon dioxide from the lungs.', 'Alina Gonzalez, who wrote "" How I Learned to Fall Asleep in Under 1 Minute "" for Byrdie.com, says that 4-7-8 helped her fall asleep amid her nerves and severe anxiety the week before she was scheduled to give the bridesmaid speech at her best friend’s wedding.', 'When Gonzalez told her friend that she was having trouble getting to sleep due to a combination of stress and pre-wedding jitters, the bride-to-be, who was a licensed wellness practitioner, told her that the 4-7-8 technique would change her life. It did. Like so many others who swear by this method, the originally skeptical Gonzalez wakes up each morning to the incredulous realization that s he does not even remember completing the final 4-7-8 cycle because it put her to sleep so quickly.', 'The 4-7-8 exercise certainly has the potential to help overly stressed, anxiety-ridden Millennials (as well as members of the general population at large) fall asleep more quickly. It is also known to have positive effects when implemented throughout the day during times of stress, anger, guilt, frustration, or internal tension. When weighing the painlessness of this completely free method against the irritability, headaches, distractedness, impaired cognitive skills, weight gain, and even heart disease that can result from the ""performance killer"" known as sleep deprivation, it seems worth a shot.']",How to Fall Asleep in Under a Minute,"The simple method takes hardly any time, and can be done pretty much anywhere","#howto, #lifehack, health, psychology, sleep","['https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/you-asked-juice-cleanse1.jpg?quality=85&w=405', 'https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/you-asked-whiten-teeth1.jpg?quality=85&w=838', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==', 'https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/you-asked-juice-cleanse1.jpg?quality=85&w=838', 'https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/sleeping.jpg?w=720', 'https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/you-asked-is-dessert-bad-for-me1.jpg?quality=85&w=838']",http://time.com/3841758/fall-asleep-under-one-minute/,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Breathe in 4 seconds, hold for 7, breathe out for 8, in through the nose, out through the mouth. #StopClickBait', 'spoilerPublisher': 'Stop Clickbait - Lifestyle'}","['breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight.

So we decided to do some research about how you can actually do this."", ""First, let's talk about all those creams, pills, treatments, and surgeries that promise to give you a way longer, stronger boner."", 'They... probably won\'t work. ""You can only maximize your size to what you’re capable of achieving,"" Dr. Harry Fisch, clinical professor of urology and reproductive medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and author of The New Naked, tells BuzzFeed Life.', 'Even those penile extenders and stretchers that claim to work over time would actually just be stretching your flaccid length, and that has absolutely no correlation to how big you get when hard, says Fisch. So don’t waste your money on a product or service that swears it can give you five more inches. ""There’s no actual scientific study that they rely on.""', '""Here’s the thing,"" says Fisch. ""You can increase the size of your penis — visually. The way you can do it is by losing weight.""', 'This is not a trap. When you have excess fat around your pubic area and stomach, it could make your penis seem smaller. ""If you lose weight, you can actually gain an inch or two because the [pubic] fat would be less,"" says Fisch.', ""So if you've noticed a little extra weight around that area, losing a few might come with the added bonus of looking bigger where you actually want to. If you're not sure where to start, check out our Clean Eating Challenge and our 28-Day Get Fit Challenge for some inspiration."", 'Another way to look bigger: Trim your pubic hair.', 'Again, not a trick, just an aesthetic truth. Cutting back the hedges will make your penis look longer. Obviously, pubic hair grooming is a personal preference, but if you’re goal is to be bigger, this seems way less painful than some shady penile extender you can buy off the internet.', 'Then make sure your boner is at maximum capacity... because, it might not be.', '""Whatever your maximal length or girth is, you can’t get it bigger than that,"" says Fisch. ""However, a lot of men don’t meet their potential.""', 'That’s usually because they’re not getting enough blood flow to the penis, which could be the result of being overweight, smoking, increased cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. So the first step in your penis-growing experiment should be to get the rest of your body healthy — especially your cardiovascular system. ""What’s good for the heart is good for the penis,"" says Fisch.', 'And OK, yes, there are some pills you can take.', 'Obviously erectile dysfunction meds like Viagra and Cialis are the most common. While they won’t necessarily add inches, they do increase blood flow to the penis. So if you’re not getting a firm erection on your own, these can help you hit your peak penis length. Talk to your doctor if you think you could benefit from a prescription.', 'Supplements can also help, like antioxidants to increase your vascular health or l-arginine to increase nitric oxide and blood flow — both of which can lead to stronger boners, says Fisch.', ""It's worth noting here that if you're having problems getting or maintaining an erection, or if your erections just aren't what they used to be, that could be a sign of a bigger health issue, like heart disease. Definitely talk to your doctor if you're experiencing problems like this. Don't just borrow a few pills from your friend's Viagra Rx."", 'ALL THAT BEING SAID, you really shouldn’t worry so much about your size anyway. Seriously.', ""First of all, if you're feeling ill-equipped after watching porn — stop comparing your goods to a porn star's. The average erect penis is 5.4 inches, and most men fall within an inch of that, says Fisch. Chances are, you're actually pretty close to average."", ""And if you're worrying about your size pleasing your partner, remember that penetration is just one part of sex, and everyone's preferences are different. Many women don't even orgasm from penile-vaginal sex, for instance, and other people don't care very much about size or length. The size of your penis could possibly be unrelated entirely to your partner's ability to experience pleasure."", 'Now, let’s have an honest conversation about those who do have a smaller than average penis.', ""Sure, you may encounter partners who may be turned off by that, as with any physical or sexual preference. But you’ll also find partners who are turned on by it, or who don’t care either way. It’s all about finding the right sexual compatibility with the right partner — and that might include adding more oral stimulation, manual stimulation, sex toys, and so on. It's 100% entirely possible to have an amazing sex life with any size penis (or, you know, none at all)."", ""Bottom line: You can't magically grow a bigger penis... and that's OK."", ""Yes, you can make some small health and aesthetic tweaks to have the biggest and hardest penis that's physically possible for you. But in the end, the best thing you can do for yourself is to worry less about size, and instead focus on finding a partner who you're sexually compatible with.'""]",Here’s How To Actually Make Your

7ad6d658-1bdb-4778-9718-2909a31a366f,400454284284014592,the fascinating tradition that sets baseball apart,Twitter,"[""There are several competing theories as to why, in the middle of the seventh inning, every baseball game comes to a stop so everyone can stretch, sing a really old song and take a breather. But for more than a century, the seventh inning stretch has been one of baseball's most cherished moments, exemplifying the humor, sportsmanship and love of tradition that make the sport unique."", ""Here are five reasons why baseball wouldn't be the same without this random, joyful moment."", 'THE MUSIC', 'Aside from the national anthem at the beginning of most sporting events, no piece of music is so deeply associated with a specific moment in sports. It was written by Jack Norworth, who had a successful career in show business starring on Broadway in the early 1900s before also appearing in several sound films.', 'THE MYSTERIOUS ORIGINS', 'The origins of the seventh inning stretch are lost to the shadows of history. One popular story dates back to the days of President William Howard Taft, who was attending a game in 1910 and stood up during the middle of the seventh inning to stretch his legs. Naturally (the story goes) when all of the other fans in attendance saw Taft stand, they followed suit.', 'Another theory about the tradition\'s origins cites an 1869 issue of the New York Herald, which documented a game in which the entire crowd simply stood up after a brutally long second inning of play, thus inventing ""the stretch"" (albeit a bit earlier in the game). Other competing accounts are out there, but no conclusive proof.', 'President William Howard Taft throws out the first ball to open a baseball season in history in Washington in April of 1910. (Photo by Mark Rucker/Transcendental Graphics, Getty Images)', 'THE CAMARADERIE', 'Dave Ferguson, a baseball enthusiast and the radio host of ""Beyond the Cheers,"" believes that no matter which origin story you prefer, the seventh inning stretch remains as integral to the game as anything.', '""It\'s actually taken on its own life, depending on the team,"" Ferguson told HuffPost. ""The players look at it as a break from the game itself. And it\'s appreciated by the fans.""', 'Tony La Russa: ""The seventh inning stretch is another tie to our history."" (AP)', 'THE TRADITION', '""The seventh inning stretch is another tie to our history,"" Tony La Russa, the three-time World Series-winning manager, told The Huffington Post. La Russa believes that the stretch helps to remind players and fans of the game\'s roots, which is especially valuable even as other things change, such as the structure of the playoffs or the addition of instant replay.', 'THE RELIEF', ""Baseball is physically and mentally grueling. The lack of a game clock, the open-ended nature of every game, its division into turn-based innings rather than periods or quarters -- all these elements contribute to baseball's unique flow. The 162 games of the regular season are played over about 185 days, plus the seven weeks of spring training and the playoffs. During the season, players work daily on their physical conditioning in the weight room, batting cage or bullpen, and they are constantly reviewing video for tendencies."", 'Ichiro Suzuki, the New York Yankees outfielder and future Hall of Famer, told The Huffington Post a few weeks ago that he took a mere three days off after his 13th season before resuming hitting duties.', 'And the games themselves may be getting longer, making the seventh inning stretch even more of necessity for players. According to MLB.com, the average time for a nine-inning game in the 1970s was around two hours and 30 minutes. During the 2000s however, that time had increased by a full 20 minutes. This past season, the average game time tied the all-time high of two hours, 58 minutes. And during those nearly three hours, actual baseball happens for only 18 minutes -- including balls in play and wild pitches -- according to a study by The Wall Street Journal.', 'Relive The Longest Game In Baseball History:', 'Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @Schultz_Report.

While other women are more concerned with clothing and beauty, Belle’s nose is buried deep in a book -- and she’s not ashamed of it. In fact, in the film she even tries to teach another young girl how to read before being ridiculed by residents of the town for doing so.', 'She held this impromptu lesson while doing her laundry. Rather than washing the clothes by hand, Belle attached a barrel to a mule and had the animal walk around in circles around a well, creating a washing machine, likely unseen before in the town.', 'In the original ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the audience simply knows ""crazy Maurice"" (Kevin Kline) as a widower and Belle as his apparent caretaker. It was never clear who Belle’s mother was or what happened to her.', 'But thanks to the remake, those questions have finally been answered. With a little help from a magical book -- courtesy of the enchantress who cursed him -- the Beast (Dan Stevens) and Belle travel back in time to Paris, where Belle was born. The pair are transported into a tiny, disheveled studio apartment with a view of a busy street. It’s ""much smaller"" than Belle imagined. It’s here the Beast tells Belle what happened to her mother.', 'After spotting a doctor’s mask on the floor, the Beast concludes Belle’s mother died from the plague. A flashback between Maurice and Belle’s mom (Zoe Rainey), sick in bed, saying their farewells proves this to be the case. The woman tells Maurice to take Belle away so she doesn’t catch the disease as well. So he does, and the rest is history.', 'The Beast was a rich prince, pompous and entitled -- but he wasn’t always that way. In the 1991 animated movie, the audience assumes the Beast was born like that, his attitude simply accompanying the crown. In the remake, we found out that’s not entirely the case.', 'While Belle asks Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) and some others why they remain loyal to the Beast, they explain that they failed him when he was a boy. The Beast lost his mother at a young age, and the castle staff said his cruel father kept him away from her while she was on her deathbed. Therefore, they feel responsible for his behavior, because they never ""protected"" him from his dad, who they say turned him into a ""Beast"" well before his physical transformation.', 'It’s true. Lyrics to one of the movie’s most popular songs, ""Gaston,"" sounded a little different than the original. While they were new to moviegoers, ""Beauty and the Beast"" composer Alan Menken said they weren’t technically ""new"" -- they were simply unused lyrics by the late Howard Ashman that didn’t make the cut in the original film.', '""[They’re] not actually new lyrics, they’re actually Howard Ashman’s that were outtake things,"" Menken told ComicBook prior to the premiere in Los Angeles. ""We had also put some of the outtake lyrics from Howard in the Broadway show. And the reason that they hadn’t been used in the animated was that they were quite edgy.""', 'For example, the added lyric ""I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver and I shoot in the liver"" was too edgy for an animated film, but for this one, Menken said it was perfect.', 'Unlike in the original, the new Beast is highly educated, boasting about his expensive education while quoting Shakespeare and critiquing Belle’s admiration for ""Romeo and Juliet.""', 'This is a sharp contrast from the original movie, where a bored and seemingly illiterate Beast needed Belle’s help sounding out words in the books. The Beast is anything but bored with the books and agrees with Belle that his huge library really is wonderful. The Beast doesn’t need any help reading a book, and Belle even catches his reading a romance alone in the garden at one point.', 'What happened to Mrs. Potts’ children, Chip’s brothers and sisters? While Chip (Nathan Mack) has always been front and center, it was made clear in the 1991 movie that he wasn’t alone.', 'In the original film, Mrs. Potts told Chip to join his brothers and sisters in the cabinet. This time around, Chip tucked himself in within an empty cabinet late at night with no explanation as to whether he had any siblings. We assume, this time around, he’s Mrs. Potts’ only child.', 'Not cool, Gaston (Luke Evans). While trying to win the affection of his ""future father-in-law,"" Gaston pretends to believe Maurice’s warning that a strange Beast has taken his daughter, Belle, captive. So he and LeFou (Josh Gad) take a horse and carriage out in the middle of the night, asking Maurice to lead the way.', 'When Maurice approaches the path to the Beast’s castle, he discovers a tree that had been knocked down by lightning standing upright again. Gaston and LeFou exchange glances, implying that Maurice has lost it, and tell him it’s time to turn around. But Maurice refuses, explaining that they should head toward the right. Gaston loses his temper with Maurice and says he only entertained Maurice’s wild story because he wants to ask for his daughter’s hand in marriage. When Maurice says that will never happen, Gaston realizes Maurice will just get in his way, so he knocks him out and ties him to a tree, leaving him to the wolves.', 'LeFou, clearly uncomfortable with the idea of leaving Maurice for dead, pleads with Gaston to reconsider, but Gaston pushes forward and returns to town without Maurice. Little does he know, Maurice will beat him back to town, telling locals the story about how Gaston left him there to die. If only they believed him...', 'The live-action ""Beauty and the Beast"" remake made history by featuring Disney’s first-ever ""exclusively gay moment."" In the new film, Josh Gad’s character, LeFou -- Gaston’s best friend and confidant -- was presented differently than the 1991 animated version.', '""LeFou is somebody who on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston,"" director Bill Condon told Attitude magazine. ""He’s confused about what he wants. It’s somebody who’s just realising that he has these feelings.""', 'At one point in the film, Gaston asks LeFou why he doesn’t have a lady. LeFou shrugs his shoulders and says he’s ""too clingy."" At the end of the movie, LeFou is dancing at a big celebration inside the castle with Belle and the prince. He starts out dancing with a woman, but soon switches to partner with one of Gaston’s henchmen, who, earlier in the film, was pleased when the enchanted wardrobe dressed him in a puffy dress, wig and makeup.', 'In the 1991 animated movie, the Beast has until his 21st birthday to break the curse. In the remake, there’s no set deadline -- he simply just has to find true love before ""the last petal falls,"" referring to the enchanted rose.', 'And in the 2017 remake, that last petal does fall and the Beast -- who was shot by three bullets, rather than by arrows and a knife -- dies as Belle holds him in her arms on the balcony. At that moment, it appears the curse is final. Mrs. Potts, Chip, Lumiere (Ewan McGregor) and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) slowly become inanimate objects and say their final goodbyes. Belle take a long pause before finally telling the Beast she loves him as a tear slowly drips down her cheek.', 'Behind her stands the transforming enchantress, who originally placed the curse on the Beast and his castle. As she overhears Belle’s last cry, she lifts the curse, bringing the Beast back to life as a man and transforming all of the household objects back to their human selves. The enchantress then disappears without a trace.

However, according to recent research, this fast-food is also the leading cause for four types of cancer.Hot dogs were introduced by German immigrants in the 19th century and gained their popularity quickly. These days, the hot dog enjoys an iconic status. The WHO (World Health Organization) recently issues a report that suggests all processed meals can cause cancer, including red meat. The hot dogs are made of pork, beef and chicken. Factories often use leftovers from cutting steaks and pork chops as well as edible slaughter by-products such as animal feet or head, fatty tissue and skins.During the process, these ingredients are mixed together, and additives such as sat, corn syrup, nitrates, large amount of salt and chemicals are added. Most of these added ingredients have been continuously linked to cancer. Nitrosamines have been linked to bladder cancer, colon cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer.Data from the American Institute for Cancer Research shows that people who consume a single corn dog daily have a 21% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. Even the organic hot dogs contain nitrites in even higher amounts than in the traditional hot dogs.']",Foods and Healthy Life: Stop Eating This Food Immediately!

CHILI PEPPERS', 'Capsaicin, a compound in chilli peppers, stimulates the body to burn energy and create heat. In our bodies, white fat cells store energy and brown fat cells are thermogenic, producing heat by burning fat.', 'A 2015 study suggested that increasing capsaicin in the diet may stimulate thermogenesis and also induce white fat cells to behave like thermogenic brown fat cells.', 'Use fresh chilis, chilli flakes or cayenne powder to add flavour to marinades and dressings or simply sprinkle liberally on your meals.', '2. WHOLE GRAINS AND VEGETABLES', 'Complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, oats and quinoa (also high in protein), are high in dietary fibre that the gut cannot fully digest and break down.', 'The extra effort the body has to put in requires extra energy, burning its energy stores to digest these indigestible foods.', 'It is no surprise that any weight loss programme will encourage eating high portions of vegetables, and in particular the leafy greens such as spinach, rocket, watercress, kale and cabbage.', 'These vegetables are all high in insoluble fibre. As with complex carbohydrates, these will have a thermic effect on the body as more energy is used up in an attempt to digest these indigestible compounds.', 'So, aim to reach your seven-a-day, of which five are vegetables and a maximum of two are fruits. Choose fruits with high fibre content, such as apples or pears.', '3. BLACK PEPPER', 'Piperine, a compound found in black pepper, has a thermic effect and can be responsible for the breakdown of some fat cells.', 'So, reaching for the black pepper not only offers the benefits of its thermic effect but also adds extra flavour to your meal.', '4. GINGER', 'Ginger also contains capsaicin, responsible for its fiery flavour. Eating ginger, fresh or powdered, in your food can speed up the metabolism due to the increased heat production.', 'Studies also suggest that ginger can reduce feelings of hunger and may help to manage weight. Use it in stir-fries, curries and marinades or try a warming ginger tea. Slice into thick discs and add hot water, and allow it to steep for 10 minutes.', 'Ginger can also be grated from frozen or stored in the freezer already sliced, ready to use in a tea.', '5. GARLIC', 'Like ginger, garlic - with its fiery kick - contains compounds that can enhance thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. Use extra cloves if you enjoy the taste and include in marinades and dressings for a flavour boost.', '6. MUSTARD', 'Mustard contains compounds found in other spicy foods, and in particular capsaicin, that not only gives it its characteristic flavour but also can also help to increase the body temperature when eaten.', 'Add in a teaspoon of mustard to your salad dressing or include it in a casserole for added flavour.', '7. GREEN TEA', 'Studies show that both caffeine and catechin polyphenols - micronutrients - found in green tea can help to stimulate the metabolism, boosting the number of calories used by the body.', 'Therefore, it can promote weight loss, when combined with a healthy balanced diet and increased physical activity.', '8. PROTEIN', 'When compared to fats and carbohydrates, eating a meal high in protein has a bigger thermic effect. Proteins are complex nutrients and will require more energy to break them down as part of the digestive process.', 'For example, if you eat a chicken breast containing 300 calories, around 30 percent (i.e. 100 calories) will be burned during digestion.', 'Research has shown that eating a high protein diet leads to lower weight gain, in part also due to its positive effect on post-meal hunger and desire to eat.', 'Always ensure good protein with every meal or snack, not only for its thermogenic effect but also to help you stay full.

He’s the CEO and founder of SunShare, a company that installs community gardens of solar panels so even those unable to have a solar panel on their roof can access solar power. One word to describe how he sees the energy industry of the future is ""choice.""', '""What we’re starting to see is this shift toward consumer preferences actually being an important factor in this industry for the first time,"" says David. ""It’s as simple as the product we’re bringing to customers, which is giving people the power to choose where they want to get their energy.""', 'SunShare started in Colorado with a two-acre project, and has now spread to Minnesota and New York. The gardens range in size from one megawatt to five megawatts, and cover between six and 30 acres of land. Local utility companies purchase energy from the solar garden, and then community members subscribe to the solar garden and receive solar credits on their utility bill.', '""We think we can change the energy industry because demand for a type of power has never really driven the electricity industry in this country. What you had was more supply side determinations based on regulatory processes and monopoly utilities,"" says David. ""Our hypothesis and what we’ve proven is that people will change, and people making choices with their pocketbooks drives change. Solar energy is beating the costs of natural gas plants across the country right now, even the operating costs, and that’s not even including the volatility premium you’d have to price in to a natural gas plant you’d be building for 20 years. You’ve got the economic plus the environmental benefits that really make solar a win-win for both utilities and consumers.""', 'Yet change is not always easy, and David has had to work against systems that have been in place for a century as he pioneers a new way of providing power.', '""The challenges are working with utilities that aren’t really built for this new operating system that comes with the renewable and distributed energy infrastructure, so having solar and wind farms around the country near the source of where people are consuming energy. That’s not how this country has looked at consuming energy previously. You’re basically going from one of those old DOS operating systems to Windows XP. It’s a completely different experience,"" he says. ""That’s really what we’re talking about in terms of the difference in how energy is transferred across the grid, managed across the grid, consumed across the grid, and tracked across the grid. It’s that much of a difference. So you’re working with this industry that’s built on a DOS platform with DOS economics. Changing that mindset is probably one of the biggest challenges, but economics are driving that; it’s a powerful force.""', 'As he pursues making solar power affordable and available, he’s at a unique vantage point to predict how the energy industry will ultimately change. In addition to the choices available to people, David predicts it will be easier for utility companies to monitor their energy output.', '""I think you’re going to be able to track energy usage so that you can much more closely match energy production to energy demand. Previously power plants might be operating consistently 24 hours a day because they really can’t be shut off. You can’t just turn off a coal-fired power plant for four hours in a day. You end up burning a lot more energy, a lot more coal, for example, at nighttime than is actually being used on the system,"" he says. ""So you’ll see a lot less waste in the system, which overall will significantly reduce our energy consumption as a country.""', 'Energy of the future will also be more reliable and secure. ""It’s going to be terrorist-proof: you’re not going to have single points of weakness on the system where terrorists can disrupt our access to electricity. By that, I mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid that don’t fail with natural disasters or terrorism,"" says David.']",What Will Make The Future Of Energy Terrorist-Proof?,,,"['http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/methane-burn-180x122.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/UNEMPLOYED-180x122.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/02/Terrorist.jpg', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/1339818-oil-anniversary-slide-07-1-424x282.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/1339818-oil-anniversary-slide-07-1-180x122.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/09/6089_grande-180x122.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/UNEMPLOYED-424x282.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/exxonnmobil-02-180x122.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/01/TheSurge_small.png?x15124', 'http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/591fb988757c3c376698a78b35d9193d?s=75&d=http%3A%2F%2Fthesurge.com%2Fapp%2Fthemes%2Fabsolute%2Fimages%2Favatar.png&r=g', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/02/SunShare_AUG_4_2015-35-1024x683.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/08/WestTexasUpdate-Option2-180x122.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/exxonnmobil-02-424x282.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/02/sunshare-portraits-2773-788x1024.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/01/SquareLogo-White473x200-1.png?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/01/Daily-Surge-2-1-180x122.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/02/Terrorist-200x200.jpg?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/12/bpships-180x122.png?x15124', 'http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/12/bpships-424x282.png?x15124']",http://thesurge.com/stories/what-will-make-the-future-of-energy-terrorist-proof,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Diversified energy sources reduces the chance of a total attack on power supply, as opposed to a singular source. #StopClickBait', 'spoilerPublisher': 'Stop Clickbait - Science'}","['I mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid']","[[[8, 225], [8, 302]]]",['passage']

""More often than not, it’s hard to tell whether he wants to play with you or eat you.""', 'Now, Facebook has an even bigger, faster-encroaching dog for publishers to grapple with: messaging.', 'BBC uses Viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in Mexico by having its editorial staff role play', 'Facebook’s Messenger and WhatsApp products now process a combined 60 billion messages a day worldwide. As an emerging medium, messaging is bigger than even Facebook. It’s the most widely used smartphone feature in the U.S., and it’s already taking a bite out of social media. As of the beginning of this year, according to Business Insider’s Intelligence Reports, the top four messaging apps—WeChat, Viber, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp—have already eclipsed the top four social networking apps—Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook and Instagram—in their aggregate monthly active users.', 'This rapid growth is also poised to leave the rest of the mobile app ecosystem in the dust. According to eMarketer, more than 1.4 billion consumers were using messaging apps by the end of 2015; that’s 75% of all smartphone users and an increase of 31.6% over the previous year. And that number has grown rapidly since. As of this week, Facebook Messenger has already amassed 900 million users on its own. At a time when most smartphone users download zero apps per month and a quarter of all downloaded apps are abandoned after a single use, users are spending an average of 200 minutes a week on WhatsApp.', 'So, this is clearly a medium we should pay attention to. But how should publishers and news organizations play with it? To answer that question, we need to grasp what it is about messaging that’s allowed it to become pervasive, so that we can gain a better understanding of how content could fit comfortably on it.', 'Why Messaging Is Different', 'Text messages—the ubiquitous kind that are primarily used by consumers on their mobile devices—more aptly mimic the fluidity of human communication than other digital forms. The technology embedded in text messages sits in the background versus in your way. For instance, you can respond to a text message immediately or whenever is most convenient for you. It doesn’t require conversing parties to be available simultaneously, as a phone call or video chat does, nor does it assume that people would rather correspond asynchronously, as with email.', 'Text messages also offer a better representation of a person’s relationships by focusing on long-term conversations. Messages are typically organized in a list form that is automatically updated every time you interact with it. The people you talk to most frequently and recently at any given moment surface at the top of that list. You don’t have to manually program and repeatedly update the list in the way you may have back when you added your friends and family members to phone-based speed dial, or in the way you need to tell Facebook which friends are closer to you than others, a status that can change from time to time.', 'Also, in the context of the text message thread, a message you receive carries the expectation that you will engage with it. In this fundamental way, messaging differs from push notifications or alerts, which instead serve to simply broadcast information. The expectation with an alert is that as soon as you interact with it, it goes away. As soon as you interact with a text message, it sits at the top of your messaging list.', 'This focus on fluidity and conversation allows text messaging to more adequately fit the demands of our dynamic circumstances and relationships than other forms of digital communication. To successfully engage with the medium, therefore, publishers should harness these unique features that have made messaging powerful.', 'Cost Center or Revenue Stream?', 'Publishers will also need to know if messaging offers a clear path—or at least a dimly lit one—to monetization in order to see how widely they can experiment and whether this new outlet will represent a new cost center or revenue stream. While it’s too early to tell, there are a few unique related aspects that are potentially promising.', 'By virtue of it living on your phone messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data.', 'By virtue of it living on your phone, natively harnessing an ongoing memory of your conversations and serving as the best digital representation of your relationships, messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data. For instance, Facebook Messenger is aware of your identity, social graph, location, conversation history and more. This ongoing memory—coupled with the fact that users are already becoming increasingly comfortable with making payments on their mobile devices—positions in-messaging payment services as potential facilitators of paywalled content. Once they set up their relationship with a service like Stripe or Facebook Messenger’s native payments feature, users can theoretically convert to paying subscribers with a quick text versus detailing their personal and financial information at every point of sale. This could make payments via messaging more effortless than they are to facilitate via websites.', 'This unique access to data also allows for messaging to support personalized and perhaps more appropriate user interactions with sponsors. As opposed to simply serving banner ads that may feel disruptive to the conversational experience, messaging apps have the potential to serve offers based on a user’s preferences. In this vein, Facebook Messenger revealed that it will be experimenting with sponsored messages.', 'Since preserving a personal tone is essential to the messaging experience, publishers and advertisers will likely explore this area cautiously, so we will hopefully see more intuitive exercises in commercialization using this new medium. For instance, since Facebook Messenger may already know of some services and companies you ""like"" via the data you have fed the parent platform over time, it will probably prioritize facilitating messages between you and those companies you already trust and may want to hear from. On the flip side, if an advertiser gets too noisy or feels irrelevant, you can easily block them from messaging you again.', 'Editorial Experiments', 'Before monetizing it, publishers need to test the medium itself. The most obvious, lowest-friction way to experiment within messaging platforms is to simply focus on them as new distribution points for content that’s already been created. Predictably, many big publishers have dipped their toes in this way; for instance, The Economist and Buzzfeed both experimented with the messaging app Line to push out news alerts that include links back to their respective publications for the full stories. Setting up this type of experience is similar to using Twitter to alert users; simply create an account on a text messaging app, allow users to subscribe to that account and either manually send out notifications or set up automated news alerts.', 'While easy and cheap to fulfill, this use case renders an experience that’s closer to that of a billboard than a conversation, which is why The Economist deemed the exercise a ""brand building initiative."" Since the user can’t really interact with the message, at best this experiment’s results will be commensurate with the effort, and at worst, they may mirror punishment by way of a slow release of the entire works of Shakespeare over text.', 'In taking a step towards experimenting with the conversational aspect of messaging, some publishers have run efforts like live editorial commentary. In this paradigm, a publication’s staff members chat amongst themselves—for instance, discussing a news event—and the subscribed audience can follow the conversation as it unfolds and maybe even participate in the discussion.', 'The Guardian hosted a WhatsApp chat alongside the GOP debates in December, and The Huffington Post ran a similar effort around various news topics on Viber. Another related use case involving editorial conversation is acting out a script. The BBC recently used Viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in Mexico by having its editorial staff role play using actual quotes from people involved in the case.', 'As in the news alert use case, for this type of experience publishers need to create accounts on messaging platforms and build their subscriber bases. But this experiment also calls for extra time commitments from editorial staffers to write scripts and/or run the live chats. It can also require an outside trigger event, like a debate, to be happening concurrently on another screen that chat subscribers are also tuning in to.', 'Chatbots', 'While potentially engaging, hosting live conversations on messaging apps is resource-intensive and limited in its interaction with end users, as editors can’t scale themselves to respond to every user’s question or comment. This problem has prompted publishers to experiment with chatbots to allow users to interact with the news.', 'In the context of text messaging, a bot is an account operated by software in place of a person. Given a pre-prescribed set of rules a human editor makes, a bot can theoretically respond to a user in a way that mimics a human response. Quartz recently released a news app that sends a user a blurb about a story and employs a bot to ask the user to select between reading more about that specific story or moving on to the next story.', 'Forbesbot on Telegram', 'CNN created a similar bot on Facebook Messenger using the just-released Send and Receive API, and publications like Forbes and TechCrunch have created bots on the messaging platform Telegram using bot creator Chatfuel. Purple is yet another similarly powered bot that texts users with election news, allowing them to delve deeper into a subtopic within a message by texting back a pre-designated keyword (e.g., ""Kasich"") contained within that original bot message. Powering these experiences relies on a diligent, combined effort of developing a bot (frequently via a third party) and dedicating editorial resources to writing short, conversational prose out of published stories.', 'In its current state, the news bot is a novelty that more closely mimics the experience of interacting with an automatic phone teller than talking to a human journalist. The seemingly endless loop of repeatedly hitting buttons or expressing keywords in order to get a response to a specific question can leave a user quickly fatigued. The underlying problem is that bots are essentially formulas created to handle a limited set of scenarios within a pre-defined framework, and they haven’t gotten to the point where they can manage massive banks of scenarios smoothly enough to handle every-day decisions.', 'This problem isn’t so different from why, with self-driving vehicles, ""We’re clearly pretty close to making a car that can handle highway driving with no human input, since the range of possible events is pretty small,"" says Benedict Evans, a partner at the venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz. ""But driving in central Rome or Moscow is an entirely different matter that needs an entirely different level of decision-making: What does that hand gesture mean?""', 'To handle the multitude of scenarios presented in an open-ended system like chat, we need a far more sophisticated bot that can scalably and quickly run decisions based on all potential user inputs, a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that can more holistically mimic human conversations.', 'The current limitations of chatbots haven’t stopped messaging platforms like Telegram, Kik and Facebook Messenger from launching their own bot ecosystems, nor have they hindered publications like The Washington Post from creating their own homegrown bots. The promise of true AI—an interaction framework that would allow news providers to offer each of their users a bespoke conversational experience at scale—is far too meaningful to give up on. That’s why, in tandem with releasing its limited-scope Send and Recieve API for bot creators, Facebook has also released Bot Engine, a system based on machine learning that can pave the way for more complex scenarios, like handling different variations of the same user questions.', 'AI-powered News', 'Looking to the future, you can imagine an AI-based chatbot that truly comprehends intention behind language, a bot that you can have long-term discussions with about the news the way you would with a well-informed friend. This intelligent bot could also fulfill the promise of voice-based products like Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa. It would both learn who you are and understand the content within stories enough to surface news you’d likely be interested in, whether or not you explicitly told it you were—or perhaps before you even knew you were. This type of bot would be promising in the sense that it may change the current rut we are in with digital news, a relationship which Twitter’s co-founder and Medium founder Ev Williams aptly describes as ""stuck in ... the idea that [the media people consume] is what they want.""', 'Will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have?', 'While we don’t currently have AI-powered news, we can start paving the way for it by crafting the right type of conversation-based frameworks for it. What’s exciting about this for writers and journalists is that the archetype text messaging is based on—broadly described as conversational user interface (UI)—is largely driven by exposing functionality through language; ‘designing’ a killer chatbot, therefore, relies at least as much on using the right kind of language as it does on a creating a great graphical user interface. Will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have?', 'Unlike websites and mobile apps, which rely heavily on navigational design and buttons to express breadth of coverage and direct users to the content they may be interested in, with chatbots ""all of your features need to be reachable solely through words—so picking the right thing to say, and the tone of your dialogue with the user, is crucial,"" explains Matty Mariansky, who created MeeKan, a calendaring bot for enterprise messaging platform Slack. This new role of language can empower writers to design experiences for messaging-based services. For instance, Mariansky hired dedicated scriptwriters to come up with more than 2,000 sentences to handle a meeting request.', 'While Mark Zuckerberg argues that the best messaging experiences will combine conversational and graphical UI rather than rely on words alone, the role of language as a form of user experience design becomes even more important when we start designing our bots to be flexible enough to work with both text and voice. When the bot is stripped of a screen altogether, as with services like Siri and Alexa, language is the user experience.', 'It wouldn’t be far-fetched, therefore, to imagine a scenario in which journalists extend their writing skills and editorial judgment to not only cover stories, but design the channels through which these stories are distributed. These writers may also be critical to the development of an entirely new bot-influenced lexicon, introducing new words and phrases into our vernacular and, through them, new ways for users to interact with the news.', 'This type of shift—the ability for writers and publishers to design digital experiences with the same skill set used to hone their journalistic craft—could profoundly change their current shaky relationship with digital products and news distribution and, in turn, with their monetization streams and readers. Journalists don’t have to sit back and watch this bot story unfold. There are no definitive paradigms yet, so we can help write the book on creating the most engaging experiences.']",The Medium is The (Text) Message,Covering thought leadership in journalism,,"['http://niemanreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook-chatbot-1200x0-c-default.png', 'http://niemanreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Baratz1-50x50-c-default.jpg', 'http://niemanreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook-chatbot.png', 'http://hvrd.me/wp-content/themes/nieman/img/logos/reports-logo-color.svg', 'http://hvrd.me/wp-content/themes/nieman/img/logos/harvard_shield.svg', 'http://niemanreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Forbes-bot-on-Telegram.jpg.jpeg', 'http://niemanreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/BBC-on-Viber.jpg.jpeg', 'http://hvrd.me/wp-content/themes/nieman/img/logos/foundation-logo-color.svg']",http://hvrd.me/4n4FYd,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Don’t.', 'spoilerPublisher': 'SavedYouAClick'}","['you can imagine an AI-based chatbot that truly comprehends intention behind language, a bot that you can have long-term discussions with about the news the way you would with a well-informed friend']","[[[34, 23], [34, 220]]]",['passage']

Unfortunately for these ten examples, the bust has come.', ""At one point or another most of us have daydreamed about finding buried treasure up in the attic. Whether it's an old china set, some dusty candlesticks or a copy of the Declaration of Independence, there's always that hope that maybe up among the rubbish is something of real value just waiting to be discovered."", 'After all, what could be better than a climate controlled treasure hunt?', 'That dream extends into collectibles. From pogs to marbles to Cabbage Patch Kids, most of us tried to collect something at one point or another. For a fewm the passion kept going, until today a few folks have the kind of pop-culture artifacts that will amaze archeologists from future civilizations.', 'For the time being, you can probably leave those shoeboxes where they lie though, because the truth is that those old prizes rarely retain much value over time. No matter how high profile, most collections sooner or later become little more than old curiosities, remnants of a fad that only really made sense in a specific time and a particular place.', ""Yet perception often lags. When it comes to many collections, people's belief in their value as an investment lingers long after that ceases to be true. What drives the kind of passion that can send prices for laminated cardstock soaring, and what can bring that tumbling back down to Earth? To understand that, it's helpful to look at ten collections that are worth less, sometimes a lot less, than many people think."", '10. Coca-Cola Memorabilia', 'As Jim Griffith, an antiquarian and the dean of education for eBay, explained, a few rules guide the price of collectibles. First and foremost is the oldest of all: supply and demand.', '""It would be a mistake,"" he said, ""not to ascribe to the collectibles market the general rule of market value historically.""', 'That particular rule hit the market for Coca-Cola collectibles hard.', ""Back in the 1940s and 1950s, America seemingly couldn't get enough of Coke brand merchandise, and the company obliged, pumping out paraphernalia from clocks and coolers to more exotic fare, such as the iconic gas station pumps and even flatware sets. (Contrary to popular rumor, however, the Smith & Wesson Coke bottle grip was simply named after the shape, not a marketing partnership.) Prices soared for even the most mundane of items as collectors and novices alike grabbed every red and white TV tray they could."", 'This also brought prices tumbling back down when those ""collectibles"" were on the shelves of every single dime store in the country. Today, the more elaborate pieces will still fetch a good price, such as the vending machines listed for over $1,000, but most of those Coke-stamped products are now just inexpensive curiosities, available for $5 here and $10 there... if the seller\'s lucky.', '9. Americana', 'With Americana popular around the same time as Coke-brand merchandise, everyone can picture this mid-century craze: Smallville, U.S.A. houses decorated from front to back with American flags and eagles in every shape, size and permutation. Americana collectors slept under Uncle Sam sheets, ate off of patriotic plates and hung their pictures in freedom frames.', 'Today? Not so much.', '""The frenzy of buying American collectibles and American antiques from the mid- and early-century definitely has taken a downturn,"" Griffith said.', ""As with virtually all collectibles, the rule isn't absolute. While prices will chase fads for most items, the really high quality or unique pieces will always retain at least some of their value. In fact, for collections past their prime, the truly valuable pieces may even go up in value as sets begin to fade away. As Marsha Dixey, consignment director with Heritage Auctions, explained, value of a collection has more to do with the run of the mill pieces than the truly outstanding ones. Collections become worthless, she said, when the majority of its pieces become little more than knick-knacks that anyone can get."", '""What things don\'t have a value anymore that people think should,"" she said. ""is one of those things that\'s totally driven by the collector group that\'s no longer interested and has dropped out of the marketplace.""', 'By the time 99% of the pieces are available to anyone who wants them, it ceases to have value as a collection and instead is about singular artifacts.', '8. Roseville Pottery', ""Where supply and demand is as old as the concept of trade itself, another major factor in eroding value is something brand new: the internet. It's what wiped out collectors of Roseville Pottery, and it will be back later on this list."", ""For years, Roseville Pottery was a collecting craze. While the company itself went out of business in 1954, Roseville's work continued to circulate, gaining value over the years as its work grew in popularity. Whether acquiring pieces at antique shops or roadside dealers, collectors prized every Roseville find they could claim, and as a result, prices shot through the roof."", 'Until the internet came along and put a stop to all that, by taking the mystery out of the pot.', '""One of the things that eBay and the internet did was pull the cover off years of false scarcity in the market,"" Griffith said. ""Suddenly the actual supply situation was revealed. Prior to the internet and sites like eBay, I could go searching in my car to different antique markets and shops, and it was rare. With the internet, I could connect to every piece of Roseville in the world.""', 'What the internet revealed was how much prices depended not just on supply and demand, but also on regional supply and demand. A piece was as valuable as the supply of Roseville pots that the buyer could find, regardless of how many existed in the wide world. When the local antique store has just two pieces in stock, that can drive up some hard bargains. When shoppers can go home and Google up 800 more, not so much...', '7. Thomas Kinkade Paintings', 'Another success story brought low by the internet, for a period of time in the \'80s and \'90s, Thomas Kinkade, the ""Painter of Light,"" was absolutely everywhere.', ""Now, to a degree, Kinkade's work was value-driven. His paintings are legitimately attractive, sometimes downright beautiful, and he was doing something with colors and warmth on canvas that didn't really exist in popular culture at that moment. Yet Kinkade was a victim of his own success, creating an entire company out of reprinting his paintings, complete with dedicated franchise galleries across the country and a $110 million IPO in 1994."", 'By its peak, Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries had 350 locations across the nation, before its bubble burst in a slow collapse began in the early 2000s, culminating in a bankruptcy filing in 2010.', 'What happened? A combination of the two factors we\'ve already discussed: market glut and the internet. As Kinkade flooded the country with his prints, the value of the product in stores increasingly became an illusion. Prices represented how likely you were to find another Kinkade around the block -- ""local scarcity"" as Dixey put it, not how much the piece was objectively worth. The bubble would burst sooner or later, and internet marketplaces did the trick. Once prospective buyers could reach the thousands of works that T.K.S. Galleries had been pumping out for over a decade, the rest was just a matter of time.', '6. Hummel Figurines', 'Most people have heard the name ""Hummel"" before. One of the most popular collectibles in American history, Hummel figurines are virtually synonymous with meticulously sorted rows of tchotchkes painstakingly assembled over the years.', ""Hummel first started producing its porcelain figurines in 1935 after the drawings of a German nun, Maria Innocentia Hummel. After GI's returned from Germany in the 1940s bearing gifts of these for their wives and girlfriends, the collections began to catch on, because there was enough scarcity to create a legitimate secondary market. No one could go to the shop and just get another, you had to hunt for what limited supply was out there."", 'Over the course of the 20th Century, Goebel, the parent company that owned Hummel, decided to break that model. Endless special editions and limited runs proliferated, all based on the proposition that pieces would continue to appreciate in value. Hummels were sold as an investment, while the very act of selling them in bulk undermined the scarcity that made them valuable in the first place.', ""Like with Thomas Kinkade's work, eventually buyers could readily find excess product, either from the manufacturer or a flooded secondary market. The value plummeted, and today, while some few retain their value, most are little more than paperweights."", '5. Comic Books', ""If flooded markets and the internet have dragged down collections' value, what causes it in the first place? There must be some good reason why otherwise sane people shell out sometimes millions of dollars for a few colored pictures on musty paper."", 'The reason, Griffith explained, has much to do with emotion. It is often, he said, about a ""shared cultural moment."" Collections, especially pop culture or mass produced works, are about the things we form an attachment to en masse. Hummel represented the end of the war years while Thomas Kinkade marketed his paintings to spaces where young couples would splurge on vacation.', 'A collectible is ultimately a personal decision that something has value far greater than the cost of its commodity, and prices can shoot up when society decides to embrace that collectively.', '""There is no greater evidence of that,"" Griffith said, ""than the explosion of the comic book industry into both collecting and media. The idea now that our biggest blockbusters are all based on comic book heroes is not coincidental to the fact that today\'s audience were all comic book readers when they were younger.""', 'Unfortunately, despite the impression many people have of lost riches in the paperbacks of their youth, the reality is far more mundane. Aside from the highest value items, comic book collections are worth next to nothing these days. (Although Dixey disagreed with that, arguing that comic books ""are probably more solid than if you went out and purchased a very fine piece of Chippendale\'s Furniture."")', '4. Commemorative Plates', 'For some reason in the mid-century, the idea of memorializing shared moments on dinnerware became huge.', 'Historians are still struggling to explain it.', ""Nevertheless, plates commemorating ideas such as the Statue of Liberty Centennial, the World Series and Norman Rockwell's paintings exploded as collectibles, often fueled by QVC and late-night television."", 'The trouble is that, with no one company acting as the gatekeeper for any of these products, there was never any market scarcity to begin with. Unlike collectibles like Hummel figurines, whose manufacturer could have chosen to produce less, plates such as centennial and Norman Rockwell collections were simply stamped out by any company that had a potential buyer.', ""Although billed as a collector's item, these are products that never had any real value to begin with. Today, as the eBay listings show, these are all but worthless, with products such as the Statute of Liberty Centennial Plate selling for $0.99 and most Norman Rockwell ones going for $5 to $15 apiece."", '3. Baseball Cards', ""Cards are another quintessential collector's item. Today much of the collector's world has shifted to trading card games, where the granddaddy of them all, Magic the Gathering, can still command enormous value. (A single card from that game can still fetch upwards of $30,000.)"", 'Baseball cards, on the other hand, frequently disappoint.', ""It's not that baseball cards have no value. As long as the sport remains popular, so too will its cards. It's that they have far less value than people assume. While rare or exceptional cards can still fetch a bundle, most baseball cards are worthless. The disappointment settles in when people realize the difference between their expectations and reality. Those carefully hoarded collections from their youth, stacked up pieces of cardboard tucked away and sat on for 20 years, will fetch... well, maybe the price of lunch."", ""The reason goes back to cultural moments. America simply doesn't have the love affair with its pastime that we once did. When baseball resonated on an emotional level with almost everyone, collectors could sell their cards to almost anyone, and prices reflected that. Today, as interested has waned, so too has demand."", '""Those cultural moments change very quickly,"" Griffith said. ""If you think back, it was a year or two ago, the Seth Rogan movie The Interview and all the brew-ha-ha about Sony Pictures not releasing it. That was an interesting cultural moment, it popped up very quickly and then suddenly there were posters on eBay of this movie which looked like it may not be released which were selling for hundreds of dollars.""', 'Today, those posters will go for a few bucks. Baseball fanaticism lasted a lot longer, and may someday be back, but for now, few of those cards are much of an investment.', '2. Beanie Babies', '""Almost 20 years ago now, Beanie Babies came along ,and it created a furor,"" Dixey said. ""It started at a price point where people could afford to buy it... and then it escalated.""', 'Dixey had a front row seat for the Beanie Baby explosion.', ""A brief fad, America practically lived and died on beanie babies for a period of time in the late '90s. For many Millennials, it stands out as the concept of collections as investments-turned-junk bond, and today we still talk about the market for these little plush toys in awe (the most expensive of which went for several thousand dollars)."", ""As Slate's Mark Stern wrote of his own experience shopping for the plush toys in 1999:"", ""The Britannia bear wasn't just a toy, we explained"", ""it was an investment, projected to be worth thousands of dollars within a decade. Our father capitulated and bought us each a Britannia bear, which we dutifully kept in mint condition with the tag intact, reveling in its rarity while dreaming of the day it would be a hugely valuable collector's item."", 'One month later, the company that developed Beanie Babies abruptly announced that it would stop producing the toys at the end of the year... Today, the Britannia Beanie Baby sells for $10 on eBay.', ""Entire books have been written on the Beanie Bubble, but suffice to say that unless you're sitting on one of the Princess Diana bears (priced on eBay at an aspirational $343,000 to $450,000), that collection is worth, maybe, the gas money down to the Salvation Army."", '1. Lunch Boxes', ""On the list of nice dreams, add the idea that the old Fraggle Rock lunch box you used to use for ham sandwiches and Gatorade might help send your kids to college. Now dispense with that notion altogether, because no matter how fiercely some people might seek to line their walls with them, these products just aren't that valuable."", '""I had some experience oh 15, 18 years ago with lunch boxes and bought and sold quite a number of them,"" Dixey said. ""There were some that were indeed rare, and they were bringing lots of money.""', '""Then, all of a sudden, some things started coming out of the woodwork,"" Dixey added. ""You go back to the old adage of supply and demand. All of a sudden there\'s a glut of them and it brings the price down.""', 'One of the biggest questions in this space is, consistently: why people have such a mismatch between value and expectations. Part of it is simple lack of research, but part, Griffith said, is the very human habit of wishful thinking.', '""I did a lot of time in the \'70s as a picker going around to different homes with another antique dealer looking for merchandise to buy and sell,"" he said. ""What was amazing to me was how many people thought that what they had was way more valuable than it really was, and there was no real way to argue with them, nothing to point to.""', 'Today, increasingly, the bubble is bursting with advent of internet information.']",10 Worthless Collectibles And the Reasons They Lost Their Value,10 Worthless Collectibles And the Reasons They Lost Their

e5e1c97c-1ee9-4689-a651-11ebe3e61bbd,557xov,the antibodies that were invented to help immunologists find god,reddit,"['In the classic 1966 science fiction film, Fantastic Voyage , a submarine is shrunk to microscopic size and injected into the blood stream of a scientist to remove a blood clot in his brain. The film illustrates many aspects of biology, perhaps most memorably when Raquel Welch ventures out of the submarine and is attacked by antibody molecules, which recognise her as a foreign invader and try to destroy her.', 'The antibodies of the film look like wriggly bits of string that rush at her and then adapt themselves to the shape of her body. For an immunologist Fantastic Voyage is interesting as it was made when there were competing theories of how antibodies worked', 'One, the instructional theory, suggested that all antibody molecules were the same, but they folded themselves around their target and learned its shape – to forestall future invasions – before destroying it. The alternative – clonal selection theory – says that there were billions of different antibodies, each with a different shape. Each B cell (a type of immune cell) specialises in making just one type of antibody. When a foreign invader, such as bacteria, enters the body, only one B cell will recognise it. That B cell would begin to rapidly divide, making large numbers of clones. These newly cloned B cells secrete large amounts of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction.', 'The instructional theory was championed by no less a person than two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling , while Macfarlane Burnet (also a Nobel Prize winner) was the key proponent of clonal selection . The makers of the film followed Pauling, though, whether this was for scientific reasons or because the interaction between stringy antibodies and Welch made for better cinema isn’t clear. However, they were wrong, clonal selection theory won the argument.', 'Nowadays clonal selection seems so obviously right that it is difficult to remember that it initially appeared to have a fatal flaw. Scientists knew that the immune system of an animal could make antibodies to any foreign antigen. In the 1930s Karl Landsteiner showed that antibodies could be made to chemicals that never even existed naturally.', 'This led to a problem: for the clonal theory to be correct, there had to be pre-existing antibodies in animals or humans capable of recognising any antigen that might ever exist. This would require billions of different antibodies. And as every antibody is encoded by a separate gene, for there to be billions of antibody molecules there would also have to be billions of different genes. But there are no more than 25,000 genes to encode for everything in the human body, considerably fewer than needed to make the clonal selection theory possible.', 'The GOD problem', 'in several In the 1960s and 70s immunologists were increasingly convinced by the clonal selection theory. This led to a race to discover the solution to the problem of how so many different antibodies could be encoded. It was termed the ""generation of diversity"", or GOD problem. The GOD problem was such an important and intriguing question that it attracted many of the best scientists of the decade, and resulted Nobel Prizes . Scientists showed that GOD was due to several biological mechanisms that people had not realised could happen, including rearrangement of chunks of DNA in chromosomes, and deliberate mutation of DNA sequences', 'The difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologists had to develop new technologies. And some of these techniques, which were used to answer fundamental questions, ended up having practical applications. Perhaps most notably César Milstein was interested in understanding how, during an immune response, antibodies improve and become better at binding to their antigens. He wanted to immunise an animal and then, at various times, isolate B cells to make antibodies. He could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen, and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time. In doing so he developed, together with Georges Köhler in 1975, a method that made B cells live forever, making limitless amounts of what they called a monoclonal antibody', 'Milstein realised that their technique, called hybridoma technology, had much wider applications in science and medicine. The impact of monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases has been immense. Because they can be made in large amounts, and are specific, they are used in many experiments and clinical tests. They have now also become an important type of drug , having an important role to play in treating many cancers as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis .

Though they've found massive success in an entirely separate business — the fashion world, and they've also become increasingly reclusive. And they don't smile. But we're getting ahead of ourselves here. There's a lot to unpack when it comes to the mysterious world of the Olsen twins, so let's dive right in and find out just how peculiar Mary-Kate and Ashley's lives have become."", 'Banking on bad movies', 'Yeah, Mary-Kate and Ashley made a lot of money splitting the role of Michelle Tanner on Full House (1987-1995), but they continued to rake in beaucoup bucks when the popular sitcom ended. Their net worth in 2018 was an estimated $400 million combined. How have these child stars remained rich when so many of their peers have struggled?', ""The twins earned much of their fortune making unintentionally laughable direct-to-video movies — 45 to be exact, according to Elle. Their most famous film, New York Minute (2004), earned a dismal 11 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes – and the bulk of those percentage points are probably owed to co-star Eugene Levy — yet none of that stopped the movie from collecting more than $21 million worldwide. It's the same for much of their video oeuvre, which was largely ignored by critics. However, their 1995 collaboration with Steve Guttenberg and Kirstie Alley, It Takes Two, did garner enough attention to pull in 8 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes."", ""In spite of all the critical panning, Elle claims that the twins' film career raked in a startling $750 million dollars. Call us crazy, but we'd trade in every bad review ever written in exchange for that kind of scratch."", 'The Mary-Kate - Heath Ledger connection', ""It seems to have been forgotten over the years that Mary-Kate was somehow linked with actor Heath Ledger's death in 2008. While there was never any suggestion of foul play, Mary-Kate's name was involved from the moment the Dark Knight star's body was discovered. When Ledger's masseuse found him unconscious in his New York City home, the first person she called was Mary-Kate, twice, instead of 911."", 'According to the Daily Mail, when the masseuse finally determined she should reach out to the authorities, Mary-Kate ""sent over her security team who arrived at [Ledger\'s] flat at the same time as the ambulance."" Stranger still, multiple news sources reported that Mary-Kate refused to talk to federal investigators about Ledger\'s death unless she was granted immunity. Why was she so concerned about being implicated for something? Did it have anything to do with Ledger\'s accidental overdose on prescription pills?', 'Her attorney, Michael C. Miller, denied she had anything to hide. ""Mary-Kate Olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Heath Ledger\'s home or his body, and she does not know where he obtained them,"" Miller said in a statement.', 'Mary-Kate\'s stonewall tactic eventually worked when the DEA and federal prosecutors closed the inquiry into Ledger\'s death in August of 2008. ""The U.S. Attorney of the Southern District decided not to serve Olsen with a subpoena,"" a source told the New York Daily News, which effectively let Olsen off the hook for any further speculation.', 'Opioid crisis? What opioid crisis?', ""The Olsens are now successful fashion designers. With multiple clothing labels to their name, the twins offer everything from affordable children's clothing all the way up to haute couture. And while they kicked off their careers with threads sold exclusively at Walmart, they really shot to the top of the catwalk when they unleashed a $55,000 pill-covered handbag associated with their label The Row in 2012."", ""That's right, these two helped create a black crocodile leather backpack covered with prescription pills and called it high fashion. According to Entertainment Weekly, the must-have accessory for the fashionable pharma rep was the result of a collaboration with artist Damien Hirst, whose pill-centric work was previously featured in some of his other installations, called Pill Cabinets. So you should be sensing a theme here, is what we're getting at."", ""At any rate, this ghastly accessory celebrating drug culture seems even more offensive considering Mary-Kate's rumored connection to the celebrity drug scene, not to mention Ledger's overdose on prescription drugs. The good news: they only made 12 of them, so not only were their ill-gotten earnings likely capped at $660,000, which, let's be honest, is a drop in the bucket to their nearly half billion dollar fortune, but also there's a good chance you'll never encounter one of these abominations strapped to someone's back in real life."", 'Mary-Kate looks...different', 'For most of their adult lives, the Olsen twins looked like younger, pint-sized versions of Cameron Diaz, but around November 2014, people began noticing just how different Mary-Kate looked compared to her younger self and her fraternal twin sister. Naturally, the plastic surgery rumors flew, with some gossip sites even claiming Ashley had altered her appearance, too.', ""In 2017, the plastic surgery chatter kicked into high gear again after the Olsens showed up to the MET Gala (above), where Mary-Kate once again bore the brunt of the speculation. It should be said, however, that the tabloid Life & Style did its best approximation of due diligence when it consulted with a plastic surgeon (who hadn't treated either twin) about possible work Mary-Kate had done. His conclusion? Smoking and/or bad makeup and lighting is to blame for her gaunt face. Mystery solved."", ""The ladies rarely talk about their personal lives and have certainly not fielded questions about cosmetic surgery, but don't worry, because unethical plastic surgeons who are willing to speculate on patients they've never treated just to get their name mentioned in a national publication are never in short supply."", ""Olsens to Paltrow: 'Hold our beer'"", 'The Olsen twins were asked by Elle to recommend some Christmas gift ideas in 2014. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they exclusively suggested items from their boutique Los Angeles shop, The Row. The real shock came with the sticker prices on some of the items, or more accurately, the lack of prices, since everything was listed as ""price upon request,"" whatever that means. (Expensive. It means very expensive.)', ""Exactly how much do the Olsen twins expect someone to pay for a rare Van Cleef lighter or a deck of vintage playing cards? We'll probably never know, but we feel that we should point out that versions of both of those things can be purchased at virtually any convenience store for around $1."", 'Are the items in their shop actually worth their mysterious, but surely exorbitant prices, or are the Olsen twins just trying to give Gwyneth Paltrow and her Annual GOOP Gift Guide — with its similarly market-priced personal submarine — a run for its money?', 'Fuller House remains one pair shy', ""Portraying Michelle Tanner on Full House was undeniably the starting point for all of the Olsen twins' fame, but when the cast signed on to be in the sequel series, Fuller House, the Olsen twins were the only ones to decline. While it's understandable that they want to take their lives in a different direction, it doesn't seem too much to ask for the Olsens to at least make a cameo as a nod to the fans and co-stars that cemented their lives of leisure and luxury."", 'The reclusive duo did sort of share its reasons for skipping the reunion. According to show producer Bob Boyett, ""Ashley said, \'I have not been in front of a camera since I was 17, and I don\'t feel comfortable acting,\'"" and ""Mary-Kate said, It would have to be me because Ash doesn\'t want to do it. But the timing is so bad for us.""', 'Amazingly, Full House and Fuller House creator Jeff Franklin doesn\'t consider the snub a burned bridge, although he did tell Us Weekly that after three years of rebuffed invitations to join the show, he\'s done asking. ""But when somebody rings a doorbell, the girls yell, \'It\'s always open!\' on the show,"" Franklin said, adding, ""So that\'s kind of how we feel about the Olsen twins. The door is open.""', 'Elizabeth Olsen is no long lost twin', ""Actress Elizabeth Olsen took a bit longer than her older sisters to breakout as an actress — 21 years to be exact. But taking time before diving into the acting world isn't the only difference between Elizabeth and the twins."", ""Where Mary-Kate and Ashley are reclusive and cagey, Elizabeth is outgoing, vivacious, and comes off like an extremely well-adjusted regular person who just happens to act really, really well. Baby sister's resume also creates a significant difference between her and her sisters. Elizabeth never dabbled in cheesy tween fare. She went straight to critically-acclaimed indies, such as Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011), then on to mega-hits such as Godzilla (2014), The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and Captain America: Civil War (2016)."", 'Elizabeth is also no stranger to the red carpet and interviews, and she displays a remarkable savvy about how to navigate A-List fame while maintaining her personal life. ""It comes quite easily,"" she told Vogue. ""I don\'t know if that comes from growing up in LA and having so many examples around me all the time. It\'s something that I watched people doing well growing up.""', ""Clearly, she wasn't referencing Mary-Kate and Ashley, who famously, and hilariously failed at hiding from the paparazzi so often that artist Laura Collins created a whole exhibit around their antics. We know we're going to sound like nagging parents here, but seriously, Mary-Kate and Ashley, would it kill you to be a little more like your sister?"", ""Mary-Kate's Kool wedding"", ""There are few details about the notoriously press-shy Mary-Kate's wedding, but like many things in the eccentric twins' life, one tidbit leaked from the nuptials left everyone scratching their heads."", 'Page Six reported that a source said there were ""bowls and bowls filled with cigarettes, and everyone smoked the whole night,"" which is bizarre, especially since it took place in Manhattan, where for years smokers have been shunned into shameful, huddled groups as far away from the general public as possible. Then again, Mary-Kate married Olivier Sarkozy, a french billionaire, so maybe the cigs and the laissez-faire attitude sort of do make sense. But what about the other details?', 'Page Six also reported that guests, of which there were only 50, ""were required to turn in their cellphones"" before a cocktail reception and indoor dinner at ""a private residence on 49th Street, between Second and Third avenues."" Actually, that all seems completely in line for a woman who once said, ""We\'ve stayed quite sheltered."" Okay fine, that was Ashley, but you get our point.', 'They are living pop culture artifacts', 'After becoming enamoured with the few details surrounding Mary-Kate\'s wedding, Olsen enthusiasts Viviana Olen and Matt Harkin decided to open a pop-up museum dedicated to the strange public persona of the twins. According to a 2016 story in The Huffington Post, the venue mostly features paintings of paparazzi photos of Mary-Kate and Ashley hiding their faces, but it also has other wacky features like ""a phone that only takes calls from Candace Cameron Bure offering parts on Fuller House"" and a recreation of Mary-Kate\'s wedding tablescape of cigarettes.', 'There\'s definitely a tongue-in-cheek aspect to the attraction, which is why the curators have also published a companion magazine, which is basically just photos of the paintings with funny captions: ""Here we see an Olsen coming to one of two realizations: that she will have to close a car door herself (for some reason) or that her outfit only works sitting down."" Hopefully, the Olsen twins are as big a fan of self-deprecation as they are of nicotine.', 'Alexa, tell the Olsen twins they sound like snobs', 'In a profile in The New York Times about the launch of the Row — the Olsen twins\' super high-end clothing store, Ashley admitted she ""has never purchased anything online,"" while Mary-Kate bought something once ""at an online auction."" We\'re just going to assume it was a Jesse & The Rippers CD autographed by John Stamos because that\'s the only way we\'ll feel like these ladies are somewhat relatable humans after reading about their ridiculous store.', 'The Times story includes the following descriptions about their boutique: ""They convinced Masa Takayama, the renowned sushi chef, to sell them his ceramics,"" and ""Indeed, the store feels more like a tastefully appointed manse than a traditional retail shop, its individual rooms decorated with marquee art (a Basquiat here, a Borge Jorgensen sculpture there) and significant furniture."" ', ""Cool, so we're guessing no clearance rack, right? How about layaway, because if we can do $5 on that Jorgensen, we'll totally be back next week with the rest."", 'Did they build a billion-dollar brand on the backs of overworked interns?', ""Former intern Shahista Lalani spearheaded a class action lawsuit against the Olsen twins' Dualstar Entertainment Group after she felt her duties went beyond the acceptable scope of an internship. According to Page Six, lead plaintiff Lalani and about 40 interns past and present claim they were treated poorly and not compensated for their extremely long hours. Though Lalani admits the Olsen twins were nice during her brief encounters with them, she feels the company the twins built did not handle its interns properly. And she has a point. How do coffee runs, data entry, or making photocopies educate students who are volunteering their time to learn about fashion design?"", 'According to court documents obtained by Radar, the twins tried to reach a confidential settlement with the plaintiffs, which would have ostensibly allowed them to avoid the publicity of a trial and the additional shady dealings it may uncover. But in March of 2017, the terms of the settlement were made public, and the Olsen twins agreed to pay $140,000 to the approximately ""180 present and past interns"" who were eligible, according to E! News. After legal fees, that leaves a whopping $530 per intern who allegedly wasted their entire internship on mundane office work and didn\'t learn anything about fashion.

Most people with acne don't share it because there ashamed but why should we it's only a stage in our life it won't last forever and it certainly doesn't make us any less of a person. Clear skin or acne you are the same person. I get asked how can I be confident when my skin looks like this? The reason I decided to accept myself for how I looked is because for years I suffered with acne and for years I let my mental health take over, ruin relationships, stop me going out ect all because I was insecure and worried about other people's opinions. Because let's be honest acne isn't nice to look at. I knew I couldn't carry on being this hard on myself to the point I would cry and have a lot of built up stress causing headaches. I thought about the days when I used to have no worries when I was younger and here's what I came up with- I wasn't living life trying to impress anyone I wore no makeup so never felt less beautiful I didn't spend my time trying to make myself look perfect I didn't sit at home comparing myself to others on Instagram It's the world we live in today that makes us think like this. I don't want young girls feeling the same way I did. I don't want them to think they have to look a certain way to be accepted or beautiful. They need more role models embracing there real natural selfs because that is real life.

My acne was cystic, red, sore and I had bumps underneath my skin. I felt like I wanted to give up at this point.

I took pictures of my skin so I could see the results as to whether what I was doing was working or not and I started seeing the difference day by day. I wanted to share with you the realism of what people go through. Unfortunately acne isn't seen as normal and is thought as 'ugly' but it's something so many of us experience.
