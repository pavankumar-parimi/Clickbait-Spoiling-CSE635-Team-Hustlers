Is there such a thing as too much? And what if you got a discount on the service? But knowing how much to tip your hairdresser has to be one of the more confusing tip scenarios out there, especially if you get your hair done at a salon where more than one person works on your strands.', 'Below, once and for all, is a definitive guide to tipping your hairstylist — and their assistant, shampooist, and everyone in between. Thank us later — no tip necessary.', 'If you need a simple baseline, experts agree that tipping 20% is standard and acceptable at any hair salon. If you’re in a smaller town, 15% may be the norm. You can always ask the receptionist at your salon what’s typical, or ask on the phone when you call to make your appointment.', 'Offering the person who shampoos your hair $3 to $5 is a nice gesture. You can hand the money directly to the shampooist, or give it to the receptionist when you check out and ask them to pass it along.', 'As for your stylist’s assistant, that person is likely in training and may not be making much money, so Michelle Lee, master designer and manager at Salon Eva Michelle in Boston, recommends tipping them between $5 and $20.', '""All the assistants are there in training to be stylists, and at many places, a lot are working at minimum wage, so anywhere from $5 to $20 is fine depending on how much they end up doing for the client, or if they have been especially gracious to you,"" she told InStyle.', 'Try to bring cash to tip, if possible. Not every credit card machine will allow you to add a tip, and using cash will make it easier to tip the different people who worked on your mane. And yes, it’s OK to tip even if your hairdresser is the owner of the salon.', 'Also, if your salon offers free bang touch-ups, consider bringing a few dollars to leave as a thank-you gesture. Your stylist will look fondly on you next time you come into the salon.', 'If you’re a woman with shorter hair — meaning you get it cut and/or colored regularly — your stylists will understand if you offer a slightly smaller tip. After all, your annual bill is much higher than a longer-haired client’s.', 'As for tipping on a discounted service: Stylists are split on the issue, with some suggesting a 20% tip on the original price of the service, and others saying a tip of 20% on the discounted rate is fine, since the goal is to get you back into the salon. When in doubt, ask at the front desk!', 'Finally, if you’re unsatisfied with your haircut, communicated what you wanted to your stylist, and talked to them about how to fix it but they refused to make changes, you can definitely lower your tip. If they invite you back for a fix-up cut, though, etiquette expert Peggy Post suggests offering a tip of 15-20%.']",Here’s how much you should be tipping your hairdresser,Remembering how much you’re supposed to tip anywhere can be hard — what do current trends dictate?

But what if there were a miracle elixir that could chase that hangover cloud away -- and better still, what if that magic drink were something you could easily pick up at your local supermarket?', 'A group of Chinese researchers say that they may have indeed found this perfect hangover cure -- and it goes by the name of ""Sprite.""', 'After examining 57 beverages in a lab, researcher Hua-Bin Li and his colleagues at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou determined that Sprite was one of the drinks that best relieved hangover symptoms.', ""The team of scientists had hypothesized that what you consume after drinking booze could alter the effect of alcohol on your body. Specifically, they theorized that certain drinks could impact the body's metabolism of alcohol in a way that would help alleviate hangover symptoms."", 'Chemistry World explains it this way:', 'Some of the adverse effects of alcohol are thought to be caused, not by the ethanol itself, but by ethanol’s first metabolite, acetaldehyde. Ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and then into acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Unlike acetaldehyde, acetate is innocuous and may even be responsible for some of the positive health benefits of alcohol consumption. Therefore the key to reducing alcohol-related damage lies in minimizing the amount of time acetaldehyde is present in the body.', 'The Chinese researchers, therefore, decided that they would look at how the different beverages impacted the activity of ADH and ALDH.', 'Some beverages were found to be terrible for a hangover. An herbal infusion with hemp seeds, for example, was discovered to boost the activity of ADH while inhibiting ALDH, therefore slowing down the breakdown of acetaldehyde and dragging out the hangover effects.', 'On the other hand, some drinks, including Sprite (known in China as Xue bi) and a type of soda water, were found to have the opposite effect: increasing the activity of ALDH and thus speeding up the breakdown of acetaldehyde.', ""The researchers are reportedly planning to conduct the tests in living organisms, but the results have already generated a lot of buzz, as people around the world celebrate the possible death of the hangover. However, experts warn that we shouldn't quite raise the victory flag just yet."", 'Edzard Ernst, a medicinal science expert from the University of Exeter, told Chemistry World that while he found the study interesting, more research is necessary before we wholeheartedly embrace the results.', 'Do you have a tried-and-tested hangover cure that you swear by?

At the time, Brooks had just been cleared of all charges stemming from the hacking fiasco that ended with more than 100 arrests and the closure of News of the World, which she oversaw."", 'While Brooks emerged from the scandal without formal punishment, she had resigned from News International and spent several months on the front pages of newspapers around the globe. Her reputation in tatters, it was widely believed that her image and reputation had become too toxic to ever again hold a high position at News Corp.', ""That speculation appears to have underestimated Murdoch's affinity for Brooks. Just eight months after being cleared of charges, Brooks is set to return to News Corp in a role focusing on digital media."", 'Upward mobility', ""Brooks enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of News Corp's tabloids to become one of the youngest top editors in Britain at the age of 32."", 'Known as a sharp and aggressive journalist, Brooks was not afraid to test the limits of ethics when reporting stories. She once famously rigged a hotel room with recording devices when meeting a source who claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Princess Diana.', ""Another time, she dressed as a cleaning lady and hid in a bathroom stall in order to get an early copy of another London paper — The Sunday Times — and then stole one of the paper's scoops."", ""Brooks's hard charging ways led her to some of the highest positions at Murdoch's tabloids. In 2000, she was named editor of News of the World. In 2003, she became the first female editor of The Sun. In June 2009, she took the role of chief executive as News International, a subsidiary of News Corp that operates numerous papers including The Sun and News of the World."", ""Having risen to the top of Britain's media elite, Brooks maintained friendships with many of the country's most influential figures, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, current Prime Minister David Cameron and Cameron's communications director Andy Coulson, who also edited News of the World and served jail time in the coming scandal."", 'A fall from the top, but not from grace', 'Brooks had been under official scrutiny for her actions since 2003, but it was not until a 2009 story from The Guardian that her actions began to catch up with her.', 'By January 2011, London law enforcement had launched a new investigation into allegations of phone hacking while Brooks led News of the World. Among the allegations was evidence that the voicemail of a murdered schoolgirl had been illegally accessed, which gave her family false hope that she was still alive.', 'The inquiries dragged on for years, with Brooks eventually found not guilty of all charges.', ""Brooks avoided jail time, but the damage had been done. The former editor had become the face of the out-of-contol excesses of London's tabloid media."", ""Peter Jukes, a journalist who closely followed the hacking trial, noted that Brooks' reputation has not recovered despite her acquittal on all charges."", '""I can say that having toured around the UK talking about the trial ... the overwhelming question isn\'t, \'Why was Rebekah put on trial,\' but \'Why was she found not guilty?\'"" Jukes said.', ""But it was Brooks' bond with Murdoch that served her even after ending up as the type of tabloid fodder that she had once fed on. As the chairman and CEO of News Corp, Murdoch has been one of the most powerful global media figures for decades. His affinity for her had been the source of no shortage of reporting in the UK, with some saying that she was like a daughter to him."", 'An odd fit', 'Even if some people believed that Brooks would eventually return to a role at News Corp, few expected her to land at Storyful. But reports on Sunday said she would work with or oversee the subsidiary, which provides social media content to major newsrooms around the world.', 'Storyful launched in 2010 with its headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Founded by journalist Mark Little, the company sought to tap the emergence of citizen journalism on social media, particularly the posting of pictures and video. The company worked to find and verify this kind of content. This aggregated media would then be provided to its media partners.', 'The startup was quickly seen as being on the cutting edge of digital journalism, particularly the use of social media and crowdsourcing to provide almost real-time coverage of breaking news. The company accrued an impressive list of clients, including the BBC, ABC and The New York Times, which use content found and vetted by Storyful. (Mashable is also a Storyful client.)', 'News Corp bought Storyful in December 2013 for $25 million, pledging that the startup would operate as a standalone company.', 'Storyful had been built in part on a promise of veracity and accountability in a space that had been lacking credibility.', 'Now, with Brooks entering the fold, that promise has begun to ring hollow.', 'I feel so sorry for the people I know at @Storyful if this is true. http://t.co/eUpjZu5hVw They deserve better. — Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) March 2, 2015', 'Wait, what?

That is, until now.', 'Beginning earlier this month and continuing through June 15, the macabre creations of the late Gorey are front and center for two concurrent exhibitions at the Loyola University Museum of Art (LUMA) in Chicago.', 'One of the shows, ""Elegant Enigmas: The Art of Edward Gorey,"" is a touring exhibition organized by the Brandywine Museum in Chadds Ford, Penn. that offers a comprehensive look at his illustrations as well as work by other artists he influenced.', 'The second exhibition, ""G is for Gorey, C is for Chicago,"" pulls from the collection of Loyola alumnus Thomas Michalak, a member of the board of directors of the Edward Gorey House in Massachusetts who has collected Gorey material for over two decades. It includes a number of rare items offering a deeper look at the mysterious man behind the art, including some of his report cards, early drawings and book covers he designed, and the ornately decorated envelopes of letters he sent to his mother, Helen.', 'Pam Ambrose, director of LUMA, told HuffPost the shows aim to address the lack of awareness of Gorey\'s Chicago roots in addition to tracing the man\'s development from a budding artist to an acclaimed cultural icon who inspired creators like Daniel Handler and Tim Burton. His influence is also felt in ""Summerland: A Ghost Story,"" a small mixed-media installation by Chicago artist Kenneth Gerleve that\'s also also included in the show.', '""I want people to really think about who this man was,"" Ambrose said,"" because he appears to be many contradictions in one persona. But was this a persona invented to keep people away? It\'s very hard to say. He seems like someone who shapeshifts a bit.""', 'The LUMA shows have been a hit -- they had people lined up outside the front door on opening day, ""pretty good"" for a university museum, Ambrose noted. Tickets to a Saturday bash celebrating what would have been Gorey\'s 89th birthday sold quickly.', 'While Gorey will forever be linked to gothic subculture thanks in large part to his signature Victorian characters dressed in head-to-toe black, the show paints a broader portrait of the artist than that. For example, prominently-placed illustrations of cats throughout the show acknowledge his fascination with felines, and many of his kid-centric illustrations feel downright giddy when compared to his familiar somber style.', '""This is an artist who was much more important than the immediate perception of just the gothic tale or cautionary tale,"" Ambrose said.']",Edward Gorey Returns To Hometown With New Chicago Exhibition,Despite the fact that renowned author and illustrator Edward Gorey was born in Chicago and spent a sizable chunk of his formative years in the Windy City...,"Edward Gorey loyola exhibition,Edward Gorey chicago shows,Edward Gorey loyola show,Chicago travel,Edward Gorey art,Edward Gorey,Edward Gorey chicago,chicago around town,Edward Gorey chicago exhibition","['http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/338383/slide_338383_3464886_free.jpg', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/338383/slide_338383_3464890_free.jpg', 'http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/338383/slide_338383_3464888_free.jpg', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/338383/slide_338383_3464892_free.jpg', 'http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/338383/slide_338383_3464889_free.jpg', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/338383/slide_338383_3465149_free.jpg', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1642144/thumbs/o-GOREY-570.jpg', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/338383/slide_338383_3464887_free.jpg', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1641833/images/n-GOREY-628x314.jpg', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/338383/slide_338383_3464884_free.jpg', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1641833/images/o-GOREY-facebook.jpg', 'http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/338383/slide_338383_3464883_free.jpg', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1642139/thumbs/o-GOREY-570.jpg', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1642148/thumbs/o-GOREY-570.jpg', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/338383/slide_338383_3464885_free.jpg', 'http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1']",http://huff.to/1fGZWOe,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Edward Gorey', 'spoilerPublisher': 'HuffPoSpoilers'}",['Edward Gorey'],"[[[0, 54], [0, 66]]]",['phrase']

One memorable shot showed off the singer's protruding package in arresting profile. Shortly after the photos hit the Internet, a web site called Breathe Heavy posted what it claimed was the same image prior to re-touching. If that claim were accurate, it would mean that Calvin Klein (well, not him personally, although maybe) had stuffed Bieber's stocking nearly to bursting. Here are the two images side-by-side:"", ""Bieber's team immediately insisted that Breathe Heavy's photo was fake, and requested the web site take it down. Breathe Heavy complied, originally replacing the photos with an editor's note, but eventually removing the entire post altogether. In that since-deleted note, Breathe Heavy's editor seems to accept Bieber's explanation at gunpoint."", 'Bieber denies the photo is real, and I respect that and will believe him.', 'The question, therefore, is: Are the claims of the Bieber camp correct, and the photo fake?', 'Or did Breathe Heavy have the real photo, and capitulate in the face of legal intimidation?', ""(It's easy to make a case that Breathe Heavy's photos are the real deal: We know that at least one photo was significantly retouched prior to publication, as Bieber's camp did not dispute an earlier TMZ story alleging that Calvin Klein sculpted Bieber's pecs, filled out his abs and bestowed him pubes in this ad from the campaign; furthermore, virtually every celebrity photoshoot in America gets touched up at some point. Why would Bieber's dick be a grand outlier?)"", 'But in many ways this dispute is just a lead-in to an essential American question: What exactly is Bieber packing?', ""Let's be true detectives."", ""This is a screencap taken from a video of the Calvin Klein shoot that Bieber himself posted to Instagram. Here we have a direct, unaltered view of his package and can plainly see that it looks quite different than the massive knot he is sporting in the photo advertisement. Front-bulge will almost always look less impressive than side-bluge, granted, and this is a fine bulge, certainly, but one that seems far off of Calvin Klein's idealized Burmese python."", 'Last September, Bieber appeared onstage at the Fashion Rocks concert. For some reason he stripped down to his underwear, which produced a number of generally alarming photos such as this one.', ""There are a number of things we can glean from this photo. One is that Justin Bieber has muscles. Look at the strong boy! Another is that his happy trail does indeed appear to stop abruptly right about where it does in the pre-Photoshop version of the Calvin Klein shot in which a model gropes him. But because Bieber wore jet black briefs that reveal no hint of bulge, this photo doesn't help us understand how big his dick actually is."", 'For that, we must consult more candid shots.', 'In 2013, Bieber went to Hawaii and jumped off a cliff. After exiting the water, he was photographed walking on the beach, resulting in the image you see here:', ""This is perhaps the most revealing shot of Bieber's bulge in the wild. Does it look exceedingly large? I'd say not. In fact, it looks like any man's normal penis. Of course, it should be noted that it's unfair to judge a dick by what it looks like immediately after being submerged in the sea. However we can only work with the materials we have."", 'Next we will consult a Tumblr called Justin Bieber\'s Bulge, a blog ""dedicated to Justin Bieber\'s glorious, wonderful bulge,"" which is not run by me. For a Tumblr devoted to one man\'s dick, it\'s a pretty boring blog, but there is one compelling photo.', 'Here is a fan shot of Justin Bieber in concert, his leather drop-crotch pants dropped well below his crotch. We can see a hint of bulge, and from this angle it does not look like Justin Bieber is trying to smuggle a butternut squash through airport security, as Calvin Klein might want us to believe.', ""That is evidence supporting the theory that Justin Bieber is adequately endowed. Arguing in favor of Justin Bieber's alleged big dick are two people: Tati Neves, a Brazilian model, and Bieber's trainer Patrick Nilsson. These two claim to have seen Bieber's flesh in the flesh, and if we're to believe them, Calvin Klein has staked its reputation on the right massive dong."", ""Neves claims to have slept with Bieber during his infamous Brazilian sex romp. Here is what she told a British tabloid about Bieber's D:"", 'Speaking to The Sun, Brazilian model Tati Nevas said: ""Take it from me, he\'s well endowed - and very good in bed.""', 'Nilsson, meanwhile, was shuttled out to do damage control in the wake of the Calvin Klein Photoshop controversy. Here, according to Breathe Heavy, is his assessment:', 'And to make up it, here\'s a new quote from Justin\'s trainer Patrick Nilsson, who says JB is packing. ""I can definitely confirm that he is a well-endowed guy. I sound weird saying that, but yes.""', 'Indeed you do.', ""Two people claim to have personal connections with Justin Bieber's dick and claim it is large, but one is on Justin Bieber's payroll. While we will consider their opinions, the overwhelming visual evidence suggests that Justin Bieber's penis is perfectly average—large enough to adequately fill out a pair of briefs, but not so large that it could arouse envy and terror when plastered across sprawling billboards, or choke a cow, without enhancement."", 'In this case, it appears, Justin Bieber is the same as any man.', ""Still, we don't know for sure, and here is where we turn to you, our readers: Have you ever had sex with Justin Bieber?

After the results that have been seen in the mice study, the researchers believe that they could see a dog’s life extended by up to five years by making them more impervious to health issues such as cancer, kidney failure, and dementia.', 'Not only would it increase the length of dogs’ overall lives, but it would compound that by increasing their number of ""good"" years.

Amanda Masthay', 'While Tim was trying to make an NFL roster, Amanda was working as a bank teller making $9 an hour. ""That was all the money we had. So we went from getting by to the first paycheck that he got. I almost fell on the floor when I saw it. I had never seen that much money in my life,"" Amanda said.', 'They were tempted to buy things when they got the check. ""It took a lot of restraint and we sort of had to wrap our heads around it so that we didn’t buy some car that we really couldn’t afford,"" she said.', 'Tim says that first paycheck was for $9,000, and that while it was a lot of money to him, too, it was at the league minimum.

""How do I spend it? How do I save it? How do I budget? How am I going to play? Because it’s very difficult to project how much you’re going to earn in an NFL career. It might be a one-year career, and it might be a five-year career.""', ""How the NFL keeps its players from going broke (1:58) See what it's like to attend the NFL's Personal Finance Camp, which trains players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing."", 'He said another challenge is that they’re only paid during the season, except for a small off-season stipend. ""We receive eight or nine paychecks throughout the year and you’ve got to do all of your budgeting and saving based off of those checks. It’s a little different way of being paid than I think most people are,"" Tim said.', 'But he also acknowledged that ""if you have some vision for the future, it’s a fantastic opportunity in terms of investment.""', 'How they got so smart about money', 'The Masthays said their educations at the University at Kentucky — he was an economics major and she was a marketing major — were helpful, and that lessons they learned at a young age were also influential.', '""If we ever went on vacation as kids, I remember being 6 or 7 and my mom would give me a check register and I would do chores around the house and go wash people’s cars and save up for my spending money,"" Amanda said.', 'Tim said that at Kentucky’s business school he took a class in his sophomore year — in which he met Amanda, incidentally — and the professor said if you can save $10,000 when you’re 20 years old and if the stock market were to return what it’s historically returned, you’d have $1 million when you were 60. ""I remember thinking, wow that’s interesting,"" he said.', 'That made him think of ways he could save some of his scholarship money, which was $750 a month. One way he did that was to live in a utility closet for $100 a month in a house that four of his friends lived in. He said it was just big enough to fit a bed.', '""By the time I graduated I had saved $10,000 while living on a scholarship check. That’s what I bought her wedding ring with,"" he said.

They bought a house in Kentucky for the off-season while also owning a home in Green Bay. They’ve since sold the Kentucky home but say they didn’t like owning a home they only used for part of the year.', 'Marriage and money', 'Amanda said one of the reasons she was interested in attending the Personal Finance Camp was to see what they could do to minimize financial stress during the season.', '""Finance is one of the biggest elements of stress for most people, so if there’s something we can do that’s going to make something else a little bit easier, then why wouldn’t we want to learn about that and try to implement it in our lives?""', 'During the interview, Amanda and Tim were in agreement on most things and at times finished each other’s sentences.

After a month of this regime, volunteers in an fMRI study at UCLA's School of Medicine showed brain activity that's associated with greater emotional stability (a stronger connection between pain-processing circuits and the prefrontal cortex), compared with the non-probiotic control group. One explanation: The good bacteria in yogurt send out signals that increase serotonin, the neurotransmitter that famously reduces anxiety. While most probiotic eaters don't have big mood changes, says lead author Kirsten Tillisch, MD, many (anecdotally) say they feel calmer over time. Ongoing research focuses on the subtle, cumulative, long-term effects of microbes as anxiety reducers."", '""Your Housemates Influence You More Than You Think""', 'OK, you don\'t like yogurt.

After mice ate a peanut-butter-flavored dose of the bug, they navigated mazes twice as fast as those not treated.

(For mice, the ""superbrain"" effect lasted for at least a week after the last exposure.) We inhale and ingest this microbe when we\'re around dirt and plants; to what extent might it help us navigate life\'s mazes? Stay tuned.', '""You\'re Hungry... Very, Very Hungry""', 'Surprisingly, gut bacteria may also control appetite, nudging you toward the oozy, creamy, crunchy foods they like. Fact is, the little buggers have species-specific appetites (a microbiologist can tell what types of food you eat and predict whether you\'re slender or not just from the variety of microbes in your stool sample). ""Bad guy"" bacteria may be partly to blame for your junk-food cravings -- by, for instance, sending out sugar-and-fat-jonesing signals via the gut-to-brain vagus nerve. Plus, some microbes may help you extract more calories from food and increase fat storage -- effectively making you put on weight.', '""You Struggle To Burn Off Your Muffin Top""', 'While the blame for a big belly doesn\'t lie entirely with its wee inhabitants, the wrong microbes can contribute to it and make it harder to lose. In a study led by Liping Zhao at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, a 385-pound patient had unusually high counts of a fat-loving bug called Enterobacter in his gut. Zhao transferred the bacterium to his lab mice -- and here\'s the shocker -- they became fat and diabetic (control animals on the same high-fat diet did not), suggesting that Enterobacter helped cause obesity. As it turns out, the bug triggers chronic low-grade inflammation, which leads to insulin resistance and weight gain. The patient lost 113 pounds in 23 weeks on a diet of whole grains and ""prebiotics"" -- nondigestible high-fiber foods (examples include garlic, onions, chicory root, dandelion greens and asparagus) that feed friendly bacteria, like the Bifidobacterium in your yogurt, and starve the bad.

Just one glass (9 ounces) of red wine daily for a month meaningfully boosted drinkers' ratios of good-to-bad gut bacteria (compared with alcohol-free and polyphenol-free gin-drinking controls). A caveat: The benefit doesn't apply to sweet dessert wines, which presumably feed the wrong microbiota."", '""Sorry, You Have A High-Steak Problem""', ""Now consider pairing that grenache with something other than short ribs. The problem here is that certain red-meat-loving gut bacteria increase your heart attack risk, found a study at the Cleveland Clinic.

A few days later, Apple trumpets the high number of new iPhones the public wants. In 2010, more than 600,000 iPhone 4s were preordered in 24 hours.

The company's top-line phone, with the new features like the fingerprint reader and desktop-like performance, should be the one with higher sales.

The new study is the first to take into account the levels of arsenic in the participants' household water when looking at the amount of arsenic coming from foods."", ""The results suggest that diet can be an important source of people's arsenic exposure over the long term, regardless of arsenic concentrations in their drinking water, the researchers said."", 'The element arsenic occurs naturally in the environment. Long-term exposure to arsenic, even at low levels, has been linked to increased risks of bladder, lung and skin cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits the arsenic in drinking water to 10 micrograms per litter for drinking water, but there are few limits set for foods. [5 Things You Should Know About Arsenic]', ""In the study, the arsenic levels in the participants' household tap water were well below the EPA limit, at 0.30 micrograms per liter, on average. However, 52 participants had tap water arsenic levels higher than the EPA's limits."", ""The arsenic levels in participants' toenails were 0.12 micrograms per gram, on average. However, it is unclear what level of concentration found in toenail samples might signal an unsafe level of arsenic exposure, said study author Kathryn Cottingham, researcher at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire."", 'The toenail measurements in the study served only as a way to compare levels among people, the researchers said.', ""People who reported drinking on average two and half beers or a glass of white wine every day had arsenic levels 20 to 30 percent higher than those of people who didn't drink."", ""The study wasn't designed to find why higher consumption of beer and wine was linked to higher arsenic levels, but a few scenarios are possible, Cottingham said. [7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health]"", 'One possibility is that the ingredients in beer and wine are high in arsenic. It is also possible that arsenic is added during the filtration process that gives beer and wine their sparkly, clear looks, as one recent study suggested, Cottingham said.', ""And lastly, alcohol itself may be to blame for the higher arsenic levels, by impairing the body's ability to detoxify arsenic."", '""The mechanisms that our bodies use to try to get rid of the stuff that is not good for us can be impaired by alcohol consumption,"" Cottingham said.', ""The researchers didn't find a link between arsenic levels and intake of rice, which is thought to be relatively high in arsenic. But in line with previous studies, they found that the more dark-meat fish people ate, the higher were their arsenic levels."", 'People who ate dark-meat fish once a week had about a 7 percent higher arsenic concentration in their toenails compared with people who consumed these fish less than once a month.', 'Although some foods are high in arsenic, people don\'t need to avoid them entirely, Cottingham said. ""Probably the best way to avoid exposure from diet is to mix it up in the foods, and not eat the same thing every day.""', 'It\'s also important to keep water sources safe, she said. ""If someone is drinking water from a private well, they should get it tested. Water is something we are drinking and using every day,"" Cottingham said.

But plenty of drivers were finding a shortcut past Connor’s Takoma Park house, slaloming around dog walkers and curbside basketball hoops, thanks to Waze and other navigation apps.', '""I could see them looking down at their phones,"" said Connor, a water engineer at a federal agency. ""We had traffic jams, people were honking. It was pretty harrowing.""', 'And so Connor borrowed a tactic he read about from the car wars of Southern California and other traffic-weary regions: He became a Waze impostor. Every rush hour, he went on the Google-owned social-media app and posted false reports of a wreck, speed trap or other blockage on his street, hoping to deflect some of the flow.', 'He continued his guerrilla counterattack for two weeks before the app booted him off, apparently detecting a saboteur in its ranks.

In response, the city is posting signs to restrict left or right turns at key intersections.', 'The apps didn’t create the traffic, Mattison said, but they gave drivers options they wouldn’t have known about otherwise.', 'Waze, with 50 million users worldwide, provides navigation guidance by combining its map database with data it collects in real time from every logged-on driver. Average speed, backups and fleeting hazards such as a car pulled over to change a flat appear almost instantly on the app’s cartoonish interface. When the first Waze-enabled car finds its way to a promising shortcut, thousands can follow.', 'In Portland, Ore., for example, when drivers trying to avoid local construction began flooding a street that had been redesigned as a ""greenway"" bike route, city officials had to put up barrels on some stretches to filter out the vehicular through-traffic. It worked.', '""The apps reacted pretty quickly to that,"" said Jonathan Maus, publisher of Bikeportland.org.', 'In California, where navigation apps are as common to drivers as sunglasses, several communities are contending with overwhelmed local streets that residents blame at least in part on the programs.

But Waze was way ahead of them.', '[A Marine fights to prove he’s innocent of sexual misconduct. Then a lost cellphone is found.]', 'It’s not possible to fool the system for long, according to Waze officials. For one thing, the system knows if you’re not actually in motion. More important, it constantly self-corrects, based on data from other drivers.', '""The nature of crowdsourcing is that if you put in a fake accident, the next 10 people are going to report that it’s not there,"" said Julie Mossler, Waze’s head of communications. The company will suspend users they suspect of ""tampering with the map,"" she said.', 'Waze’s mission is to distribute traffic more efficiently across the grid of public streets, Mossler said, not to create traffic jams.', '""That said, the traffic has to go somewhere,"" she said. Although the app will continue to route drivers down any legal street, Waze programmers are working to build in alerts about school zones and other slow-speed zones, Mossler said.', 'Traffic engineers say the side street flare-ups are a downside to the otherwise positive effect that navigation apps can have on vehicle flow.', 'They have proved to be a powerful force in moving cars past bottlenecks, and in many jurisdictions, including Maryland and the District, officials have begun working directly with Waze to glean information about potholes, backups and other real-time data.', 'The cut-through disputes ""are an unintended consequence of this great technology that is supposed to help people avoid sitting in traffic,"" said Paul Silberman, a traffic engineer with Sabra, Wang & Associates in Columbia, Md.', 'Those who live on side streets have been complaining for years about becoming through routes, but now it’s happening at Internet speed.', '""These great shortcuts used to spread by word of mouth, but now they just spread like wildfire,"" Silberman said.', '[Three workers once died rebuilding this bridge.

Concrete boxes are replaced with olive groves, and the words ""traffic jam"" tend to mean that a group of goats have convened, gathering and blocking the road. Needless to say, I greatly enjoy the small villages of the Peloponnese. So when George Papageorgiou, the owner of Esti Olive Oil, asked me if I wanted to go to Kalamata to see how they harvest the olives and turn them into olive oil, I jumped at the chance. To me this was kind of like winning the lottery. I was going to the Peloponnese and getting a chance to enjoy some ""liquid gold.""', 'Being Greek, I grew up eating olive oil. I know others might disagree with me, but I will take a good quality olive oil over butter any day! I love using it to make popcorn. I drizzle it on fresh tomatoes and slices of bread. I use it to fry fish and as an ingredient in cakes. Before there were rules for the amount of liquid you could carrying on a plane, my mother and I would bring half-gallon containers of olive oil back from our trips to Greece.', ""The best olive oils come from Greece. I say this with objectivity as a chef, and would like to think that this overrides any bias that my Greek heritage holds. In Greece it is said that the best of Greek olive oils come from the Peloponnese. For years I have wished that Greeks would be more like the Italians. The Italians do a fantastic job of exporting and promoting their products to other countries. With the booming introduction of Greek yogurt into the U.S., I'm hoping that Greek olive oil will soon follow suit. George Papageorgiou is trying to make that happen."", 'The Esti olive grove in Kalamata is located in a beautiful sunlit valley. The grove of mature olive trees look as if they belong in Greek mythology. The olives must be harvested at a specific time during the ripening process. Like Goldilocks searching amongst the belongings of the three bears, George is in constant search for the olives that are ""just right."" If the olives are too green the olive oil produced will taste bitter. If the olives are too black, the quality of the olive oil will be lost. It\'s a constant balancing act.', 'As we headed into the olive grove, numerous fine mesh nets were being laid down to gather and catch all the olives. Workers set up ladders to reach the tall branches. The lower hanging branches were gently being shaken, taking care not to wound the trees. I began to collect olives in my little basket. As my hands turned a reddish-brown, I reminisced about the days I used to spend as a child, collecting olives with my yiayia.', 'We took the gathered olives back to the production plant where George had them ground into paste using large millstones. ""This,"" he explained ""is the traditional method used for making olive oil."" After grinding, the paste then gets slowly stirred in a separate container for 20 to 40 minutes. This is a process known as malaxation. With malaxation the slow churning action allows the small droplets of oil that were released in the milling process to aggregate, forming large droplets of oil which facilitates mechanical extraction. I was a bit overwhelmed during the whole process. I looked around the manufacturing facility, much like a child the first time they visit Disneyland. I snapped pictures. I wanted to see what was behind every door. I asked George if the oil we had witnessed being made was virgin or extra virgin. I had always assumed that the grading of ""extra virgin"" denoted a different process or different stage in the olive\'s ripeness. George shook his head. This was not correct. In fact, all olive oil produced by physical (mechanical) means is virgin. The differentiation of ""extra virgin"" is the virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria. In layman\'s terms it is the virgin olive oil that has low free acidity and no quality defects.', ""The final room we visited that day was lined with shiny steel tanks, much like a winery. The storage of the olive oil in steel tanks helps to preserve it and keep it from oxidizing. It's the final resting place for the olive oil before it is bottled."", ""In Greek, the word theoxenia comes from mythology and relates to hospitality; how hosts treat guests or even strangers. It's an important part of Greek culture. This was something George clearly keeps in mind. Before leaving the facility that day, George sent me home with a box filled with bottles of olive oil: virgin, extra virgin, organic extra virgin. That night, and many nights since, I have enjoyed his olive oils. In each bite I can taste the olive grove and its bright sun-kissed fruit. I can't help but think that everyone, even the French, might fall in love with olive oil if they had a chance to taste the Greek rendition.""]",Making Olive Oil in the Peloponnese,"Even though the Peloponnese is only an hour's drive away from Athens, it's as if you're entering another world, or at least another country.

f8ecbcac-fd2a-4d12-8ebe-ea9c03118c74,4tuj89,"breaking: this state just banned the sale of all semi-auto rifles, effective immediately",reddit,"['Well, we all knew it was coming. You can’t have a ""mass shooting"" without some political ladder-climber coming down hard on the rights of law-abiding Americans. And this time it is Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. She published this in The Boston Globe today.', 'The Massachusetts assault weapons ban mirrors the federal ban Congress allowed to expire in 2004. It prohibits the sale of specific weapons like the Colt AR-15 and AK-47 and explicitly bans ""copies or duplicates"" of those weapons. But gun manufacturers have taken it upon themselves to define what a ""copy"" or ""duplicate"" weapon is. They market ""state compliant"" copycat versions of their assault weapons to Massachusetts buyers. They sell guns without a flash suppressor or folding or telescoping stock, for example, small tweaks that do nothing to limit the lethalness of the weapon. That will end now. On Wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in Massachusetts. With this directive, we will ensure we get the full protection intended when lawmakers enacted our assault weapons ban, not the watered-down version of those protections offered by gun manufacturers. The directive specifically outlines two tests to determine what constitutes a ""copy"" or ""duplicate"" of a prohibited weapon. If a gun’s operating system is essentially the same as that of a banned weapon, or if the gun has components that are interchangeable with those of a banned weapon, it’s a ""copy"" or ""duplicate,"" and it is illegal. Assault weapons prohibited under our laws cannot be altered in any way to make their sale or possession legal in Massachusetts.', 'Yes, you’ve read correctly. Every black rifle, and all of the variants, compliant versions, and anything that any of these yokels think might be used for an ""assault"" is now strictly illegal.', 'What about all of those guns currently in the law-abiding hands of law-abiding gun owners?', 'We recognize that most residents who purchased these guns in the past believed they were doing so legally, so this directive will not apply to possession of guns purchased before Wednesday. In the dozen years since the federal assault weapons ban lapsed, only seven states have instituted their own assault weapons ban. Many of those bans have been challenged (unsuccessfully) by the gun industry, and we anticipate our directive may be too. But our job is to enforce state laws and to keep people safe. This directive does both.', 'Right. Because the criminals who are shooting up campuses and theaters and police protests–they’re all easily stopped by enacting a simple bit of legislation. I could tell you just how many mass murders were thwarted when the perpetrator ran up against a law like this, but I wouldn’t want to let the wind out of the AG’s sail.', 'In the face of utter inaction by Congress, states have a duty to enact and enforce laws that protect people from gun violence. If Washington won’t use its power to get these guns off our streets, we will. Not only do we have the legal authority to do so, we have a moral obligation to do so.', 'Wait–to get the guns off the street?

Email the Funbag. Today, we’re covering egg whites, sex, cats that do dishes, and more.', 'I took my family on a short road trip for spring break, and on the way home, my 2-year-old asked me to pull over so he could go take a crap. So I did. I pulled into the gas station, and then my wife brought the kid to the bathroom, and he announced that he was bluffing. He did NOT have to take a shit. So he got back in the car, and we drove for another 30 minutes, and then he announced, for a second time, that he had to go poop.', '""You’re not lying this time, are you?"" I asked him. ""If you’re lying, I’ll never stop for you to poop again.""', 'But he said he had really had to go, so I pull over, and it’s the same thing. He was either lying or he got stage fright in the McDonald’s can. So my wife puts him back in the car, and we get stuck in traffic on the Beltway just as we’re getting home.', 'I think you know where this is going. Once again, the boy screamed out that he had to poop. I told him he could hold it until we got home. Then he started clutching at his tummy and crying out to pull over.', '""I don’t think he’s lying this time,"" my wife said. But I swear to you, we were just a mile from home at that point. And the Beltway is one of those horrible roads that offers very little in the way of ideal places to pull over. Home was the only logical destination for him to go void his bowels. So I told him he had to hold on jussssst a minute longer. Begged him, really.', 'Sponsored', 'On the exit ramp, he suddenly stopped crying. And I knew why. I could hear him exhaling forcefully. Kids don’t hide that sort of thing. We pulled into the driveway (not before hitting every light on the way there), and my wife rushed the boy into the house and into the bathroom. Green shit was CAKED on his legs. It was everywhere. Some of it fell out of his pants (how?) and landed on the front stoop. It was terrifying. Anyway, that’s parenting in a nutshell for you. You take every precaution possible, and you still end up with green shit all over the place.', 'Now, your letters:', 'Dan:', 'I don’t know if this is a good question, because I doubt there’s any kind of satisfying answer to it. But why do no NFL teams seem to care that Jameis Winston maybe raped a girl? The mock drafts all have him going at no. 1 or 2 (most say no. 1). How the fuck?! Especially in light of the year the NFL has just had (and Goodell’s publicity push for an end to violence towards women), would it be that crazy to suggest that NFL teams won’t want to risk spending their first-round pick on someone who many people believe has a capacity for actual evil? Even if he never raped anyone, he has shown he’s a liability, at best, with the crab-legs thing and the ""fuck her right in the pussy"" thing. How are Bucky Brooks and Daniel Jeremiah not even hedging their bets at this stage? I’m sure last year they talked ad fucking nauseum about Johnny Manziel’s partying and how that would affect his draft stock. HOW DOES RAPE NOT??? Why aren’t they even mentioning it?', 'I think you’re wildly overgeneralizing to say teams don’t care. Of course they care. You’d care if you were the GM who decided to risk his job by investing the no. 1 pick in a seafood thief and alleged rapist. But the Bucs desperately need a QB (or else everyone gets fired anyway), so they’re probably best off drafting Winston and then throwing out a bunch of some bullshit spiel to Peter King about how they had private eyes talk to over 75 people about Winston in studying him for the draft. That strikes me as an obvious ass-covering move so they can draft Winston, and then, if he fucks up, they can be like, ""Don’t blame us! We talked to 75 whole people about him!"" They just want to make sure he doesn’t commit any FUTURE rapes. And if he does, they want to make sure that they can blame Winston and Winston alone for it.', 'But it is strange that, in the public scouting process, Winston’s past has been reduced to a handful of convenient euphemisms like ""immaturity"" and shit like that. Look at Lovie Smith gush about Winston, even though he can’t possibly know him all that well:', '""To me, I think he’s told us an awful lot with how he’s handled it,"" Smith said. ""It’s not like he’s getting ready to go into the NFL and scrutiny is coming his way. He’s gone through it a couple years now, and he’s answered the bell. That’s what you have to do. You have to have tunnel vision and do your job. Looking from the outside, that’s what he’s been able to do.""', 'I mean, that’s a hell of a way to twist a rape allegation into a positive. LOOK AT HIM SHAKE OFF DEFENDERS AND CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES WITH SUCH EASE! The fact that Winston was never formally charged with rape, and the fact that the NFL and their broadcast partners probably have a great many lawyers who would prefer that the word RAPE not be thrown around when addressing Winston, is all Smith needs to sell you on the IDEA of drafting him ... to concoct a narrative of an ambitious young man looking to redeem himself as a way of cleverly masking the fact that the Bucs have an urgent, raw football need to fill, and they have little choice but to fill it with a guy who might be the scum of the fucking Earth.', 'That’s why Winston’s rape allegations haven’t necessarily affected his draft stock the way Johnny Manziel’s drinking did. It’s because NFL teams think that Winston is simply a better player. If neither player had baggage going into the draft, Winston would be taken before Manziel every time. That’s the reason the Browns are ready to give up on Manziel already. It’s not the boozing. It’s the fact that they don’t think the little fucker can play. The NFL can chirp all they like about domestic violence and doing the right thing, but the bottom line is that the majority of their employees must win in order to keep their jobs, and that means they must place a bloodless premium on talent than the NFL would rather not acknowledge as still existing. They constantly want to sell you on character or on potential character instead. If Jameis is gonna go no. 1 no matter what, the NFL has no choice but to hold their noses and make it look like they didn’t willingly crown a psychopath prince of the draft.', 'You know what’s funny about all this? Winston was AWFUL last season, and I’m not talking about just his ""Yakety Sax"" play in the Rose Bowl. He threw 18 picks last season against horrible, piddly-shit ACC teams. But scouts, for some reason, seem to be far more impressed by the fact that Winston staged a number of winning comebacks that were necessitated almost exclusively because of his own boneheaded mistakes. If you look the part, and you’ve got the arm, and you have that subjective mix of football IQ and magical QB unicorn leadership skills, scouts will happily overlook all those turnovers. And the rape stuff. It’s quite something.', '(By the way, SUPERFUCK Jaws and Mike Mayock for their little ""Mariota’s on top of my board now!"" spiel this week. Jaws is an empty-headed attention whore who will say basically anything. And the only reason certain football fans enjoy Mayock is because they haven’t learned to be sick of him yet.)', 'Kyle:', 'Are BIG EGG and BIG NUTRITION teaming up to push the egg white agenda? You have to have roughly double the egg whites to get the same amount of food, thus causing an increase in egg consumption. I’m suspicious of the whole thing.', 'But the yolk has all the cholesterol! If you simply throw out the yolk, and then add bacon, ham, and cheese to your omelet, it can’t hurt you at all! That’s science.', 'I used to be huge on egg whites. True story: In college, I would go to the dining hall, toast a bagel, grab a couple of hard-boiled eggs, remove the yolks, and then mush the whites onto the bagel and eat a sad egg-white bagel sandwich that way. I thought this was a healthy lunch, conveniently ignoring the whole ""eating a whole bagel"" part of the enterprise. Sometimes I ate two in one sitting. Do not do this.', 'The truth is that egg whites are one of those foods you eat so that you can eat more food. I hate small portions, so if I eat a 12-pound egg-white omelet, I feel like I just got away with something. But in general, this is untrue. You need portion control in your life, which means you should just splurge and eat the goddamn yolk anyway. The yolk is the best part. All golden and runny and seeping into the toast nooks ... I could a 50-egg omelet. I swear. There are never enough eggs in the omelet for me. Why are eggs so small? I need eggs to be triple their current size. I don’t like cracking so many of them. I am not a crackpot.', 'Danny:', 'If tomorrow, you could appoint any current non-politician in America as the POTUS for the next eight years, who do you think would do the best job? Give me your top 3, and provide reasons why. It has to be a public figure—don’t get all sappy and say your dad, or your awesome 2nd-grade teacher. Also, assume that anyone who you appointed would drop whatever else it was they were doing and accept their next eight years living in the White House.', 'Well, look, it’s not like politicians are somehow uniquely skilled anyway. Pretty much anyone can be a politician if some shadowy party operative hands them a bag of cash and is like, ""Bill Kristol says you have nice teeth."" That’s truly all you need to become a prominent politician in America at the present moment. They should probably make you take a test or something.', 'That said, if I had to vote for one random famous person to be dropped into the Oval Office for the next eight years, I’m picking Elon Musk. I need a VISIONARY, man. I want Musk to divert all defense spending into building a giant water slide from New York to L.A. Every other issue facing the country would be solved if such a water slide existed. Don’t tell me it can’t be done. I won’t hear it.', 'I know it’s lame to pick a captain of industry for that job, but I don’t want a fucking actor. I don’t want some comedian like Jon Stewart or Louis CK who would hate the job instantly. A good president needs to believe his own horseshit, and Musk and/or Tim Cook would more than fulfill that requirement.', 'Third choice would be Belichick, because he’d fire everyone and then fuck every Congressman’s wife. And he’d have SO many secrets. Finally, America would have a Putin of its own. SUCK IT, RUSSIA.', 'Brian:', 'Me and my girlfriend have debated this for a while, and we are both dead set in believing the other is 100 percent wrong: What’s the better time of year for sex, summer or winter? She says that summer is better because the heat makes it feel that much more steamy, summer bodies are great, and you can get fully nude without having to keep any layers on because of the cold. I say fuck that.', 'September is the most common birth month in the United States, which means that we Americans seem to prefer fucking in the winter, if only because there’s nothing else to do. Personally, I prefer summer. I don’t want to worry about having to cover up all the sexy business with a comforter because everyone in the bed is colder than shit in January. I want everything out in the open. I want to be hot and sweaty and horny and dying to rip off my sexy striped polo shirt just for YOU, baby. I want the covers off and the lights on and I want to see EVERYTHING. I need good material for when I’m alone. Summer is sexier. TELL THEM, Y&T!', 'HALFTIME!', 'William:', 'Would you rather have a dog that folds laundry, or a cat that does dishes?', 'The dog, I guess. My preference for dogs over cats is greater than my hatred for doing dishes over folding laundry, so there you have it. Doing dishes blows, but folding laundry is also horrible. It’s 8:30 p.m., and the kids are finally asleep ,and I’m just about ready to settle into the recliner when I see that fucking laundry basket filled to the brim over in the corner, and it never ceases to make my blood boil. Fuck that laundry. I should only have to fold MY clothes. My clothes are big and sparse and easy to fold. My laundry is awesome. My wife should thank me for never wearing more than one pair of pants in a week.', 'Corey:', 'Let’s say all members of the Beatles and N.W.A are magically revived and/or returned to their artistic primes. The Beatles then have to go into the studio and record an album of N.W.A’s best hits, and vice versa. Which album ends up sounding better?', 'The Beatles one, because the Beatles would just take the NWA lyrics and arrange some entirely new Beatles song around them, and it would probably be very pretty. As much as I like NWA, I don’t wanna hear them butcher ""Blackbird."" None of those guys could sing. When Diddy ripped off ""Every Breath You Take"" just so he could milk Biggie’s death one more time, I wanted him to fall into a canyon.', 'Also, I bet John Lennon would REALLY relish pretending to be an inner-city black man. He’d be way too enthusiastic about it.', 'Blake:', 'How many albums a year could the top pop stars put out? Beyoncé could have the top 20 songwriters writing at all times, and the top producers and editors working year-round like Christmas elves. The masses never tire of pop music, so why not put out an album a month?', 'Because that’s too much product! Even the nuttiest white-girl Beyoncé fans would get sick of her if she put out 120 songs a year. You can’t keep up with that kind of catalog. Those songs can’t all be great. Even if they were, you’d still grade them on a curve and have certain ""hits"" in your mind that would make your permanent rotation, with everything else falling by the wayside. That’s easy to do now. Back in day, when I had to listen to tapes, I usually listened to all the songs on the album because I was too lazy to fast forward. I heard ""Back Off Bitch"" by GNR far more times than anyone should have to endure. Not their best work. I don’t have to do that anymore. Technology has made me a supremely lazy music fan.', 'It’s just not possible to absorb that much music from one artist, no matter how hard you try. Ever have your favorite artist put out a double album? It’s a complete pain in the ass. I need you to go away for a while so that I can grow to love you again. Whenever an artist says that they had 60 tracks to choose from or whatever for a single album, I can promise you that you NEVER want to hear the 50 tracks they threw away. Half of those tracks are just the guy freestyling on the bongos while high on acid.', 'Kevin:', 'So I’m getting married in a month, and my fiancé and I are closing on a house next week. Instead of some over-the-top bachelor party, I am asking that my friends just help me move. My friends feel that this is selfish, and I’m taking advantage of them. We’re moving from a 1,000-square-foot apartment into a three-bedroom house. It’s not like we have a ton of stuff. The plan was that I rent the truck, and we move everything Saturday morning, and then grill steaks and get drunk Saturday night in the new house. I think that this is way better than asking everyone to kick in hundreds of dollars to go golfing for a weekend or whatever; it’s my bachelor party, and I should be able to do what I want, right?', 'But that’s not a party. You’re asking for free manual labor instead. That doesn’t count as a celebration, you monster. If I threw a party, and everyone came, and then I was like, ""Hey guys, this is a LAUNDRY FOLDING party! Now fold my laundry and I’ll get takeout!"" all my friends would have me killed. You can’t do that. If you want to ask your friends to help you move, that’s fine. But you can’t apply that to your party credit. Do the move yourself, and then have the bachelor-party cookout afterward, without putting any work obligations on your friends.', 'Steve:', 'This actually happened close to six years ago, but it remains a contentious issue amongst our group of friends. Five of us were on a road trip from Montreal to Boston, rotating drivers evenly as one does on longish road trips. As we got close to Boston, the friend driving the last leg got pulled over for speeding. Since we were in college at the time, the $200+ ticket was nothing to sneeze at. (Who are we kidding? It’s still a lot of damn money.) The issue was — does the ticket get split amongst the group, or paid solely by the driver? The four of us who drove first say no, since we drove our portion without incident. The friend who got slapped with the bill argues that since the last leg was the toughest, and we were trying to get to our destination by a certain time, and nobody complained about his speed until the blue and whites started flashing, that we should split the ticket. Who is right?', 'The last leg was the toughest? Why? Were there dragons lining the highway? Your friend was driving, and thus he’s responsible for his own driving behavior, even if he had shit luck. He pays the ticket. If another friend riding in the car wants to pitch in, fine. But that guy shouldn’t EXPECT it. These kids today never want to take responsibility SMDH!', 'I went to a basketball game last week, and I had an Uber take me home, only the Uber guy got a parking ticket outside the arena while he was waiting for me. And I felt bad that he got the ticket, so when the ride ended, I gave him $20 in cash extra. And that, of course, made me feel all generous and kind. YES AMERICA, I helped pay a full one-tenth of that poor bastard’s ticket while exploiting regulation loopholes that force working-class people to act as private chauffeurs to uppity white dipshits with smartphones. MEDAL OF HONOR FOR ME, PLEEEEEEEZ.', 'But screw your friend.', 'Tom:', 'Where would the most opportune time/place for aliens to land to get the biggest initial audience, but not get shot out of the sky? The White House lawn would be a great spot, but they would have several fighter jets shooting at them before they land; a random field would have no one around. I feel the best bet is a major sporting event that doesn’t have dedicated aerial security. What do you think?', 'All major sporting events have (in theory) patrolled airspace. I would just vote for the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, dead center of Manhattan. News crews could get there quickly. Crowds would form. Roasted-nut vendors would make a KILLING. And New Yorkers would instantly try to take ownership of the First Contact experience. ""You guys don’t get these aliens. IT’S A NEW YORK THING.""', 'Actually, now that I think about it, let’s choose any large park space in any other city. Because Central Park is a complete fucking pain in the ass. It’s hot and overcrowded, and there’s horseshit everywhere. If aliens landed there, four million people would converge on the spot, and then I wouldn’t be able to get a good view, and the subways would be jammed, and I would just say FUCK IT and then go home and watch the aliens on TV instead.', 'Mike:', 'How does Robocop poop? He has that weird baby food he has to eat to keep his organic parts alive, so he must have to release it somehow.', 'Actually, if you look at the original uniform design, the posterior covering is soft and potentially removable. It’s not welded metal. Robocop could, in theory, remove a posterior assflap to do his business, even if no standard toilet could possibly bear the weight of a three-ton cyborg sitting down to shit in it. My guess is that instead of straight defecation, Robocop has an internal waste-management system that processes his urine and stool, and then either a) recycles it for some other practical use (poop gun), or b) can be discreetly disposed of, like through a leg dispenser. That’s what I would do if I were designing the perfect 21st-century scumbag-killing machine. RoboCop has no time for poop.', 'Aaron:', 'What happened if it came out that President Obama had a Twitter account under a different name and was trolling conservatives and his critics completely anonymously? I’m not saying one of his staffers was doing this—this was how Barry O passed the time while on the shitter. Would there be calls for impeachment/resignation? How long would the media blow that up for? What would his Twitter handle be? Would he put a picture and bio, or just keep the egg there like a weirdo?', 'There are calls for Obama’s impeachment and resignation on a daily basis right now, so I assume a @Luther account would only amplify those daily complaints. ""More like Marco Boob-io, AMIRITE?!"" That tweet would probably help fill up a news cycle or two before everyone stopped giving a shit. I don’t think he’d actually resign, though. After all, plenty of politicians out there already use Twitter for trolling purposes. And we live in age where you can survive pretty much any scandal so long as you’re willing to sit there and ride it out. You let 200 million people take a dump on your face for a week, nod politely, and then everything is back to normal.', 'I do think he’d have a picture and bio for his troll account, tho. The Obama machine knows too much about the internet to let that slide.', 'Email of the week!', 'Ape Chemist:', 'Suppose during the first round of the NFL draft, the camera cuts to a player talking on his cell phone and smiling and celebrating with his family and friends. This all takes place while the team is on the clock, so Goodell has yet to announce the pick. While celebrating, the player—like Lamarr Houston or Bill Gramatica—tears his ACL. Assume the team hasn’t officially announced the pick. Does the NFL let the team withdraw the pick? I remember when the Vikings had to pass on a pick because they didn’t get their card in on time, so I could absolutely see some team arguing the pick wasn’t official until the card is turned in and read. I hope this happens to some team like the Cowboys, and Jerry sends someone onstage to tackle Goodell before he reaches the podium.', 'I might be wrong, but I think once you turn the card in, the pick is final. No backsies, even if it hasn’t been formally announced. If you haven’t turned the card in but GLORY BOY decided to tear his knee up anyway, then fuck him. Switch it and draft Todd Gurley instead.

This one would fill your living room and uses robotics and artificial intelligence.', 'Ripcord, a startup backed with a $9.5 million funding round led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has created a machine its founders think is key to solving a huge problem faced by companies as they try to access data that hasn’t made it into the information age – billions of boxes of paper files.', '``We’re drowning in problem,’’ said co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Alex Fielding. ``The issue is not demand.’’', 'Like many Silicon Valley start ups, Ripcord believes its technology is the answer to a prosaic problem. While the internet has been around for more than 20 years, the amount of printing done by companies is still increasing. All of those forms, invoices, reports and receipts typically end up in boxes in warehouses, where the data sit and are either useless or require a lot of time and money to access.', 'Ripcord’s machine aims to take away much of the labor of turning that paper into usable electronic information. The first problem most people face when they’re armed with a computer and even the fastest desk-top scanner is how paper files are attached to each other. The company reckons that it takes the average person six to eight hours to scan a box of papers. Much of the time goes to removing staples and other fasteners that cause the dreaded paper jams. A chunk more time is wasted on the categorization and naming of files in the computer.', 'With billions of boxes of files in storage across the U.S. alone, that’s a lot of hours of work and paper cuts. Ripcord’s machine takes stacks of paper, pulls out any staples and loads them one sheet at a time onto a conveyor belt for rapid scanning, up to one sheet a second. That seemingly inane task is done at breakneck speed by a combination of industrial robot and sensors all powered by artificial intelligence software.', 'Ripcord isn’t just processing paper and putting it into boxes. It’s offering a service where it charges as little as 0.4 cents a sheet per month for scanning and uploading to the cloud in formats that its customers can access and integrate into other commonly used corporate computer systems. It also stores the information for them. The goal: all that paper comes out of the machine and goes into the shredder for recycling. Warehousing paper information is a $25 billion annual market, according to Hayward, California-based Ripcord.', 'The machines aren’t going on sale. Ripcord is aiming to deploy hundreds of the giant devices in warehouses where hoppers of paper will be moved around by robots. Fielding is keen to point out that his automated system isn’t putting people out of work, it’s going to change the way that filing work is done. The machines still need human input in preparing files and supervision of the speedy process, even though it has built-in error correction and will even divert through a trap door multiple sheets or paper with sticky notes attached.', '""We’re not replacing people with machines, we’re giving them much more interesting things to do,"" Fielding said.

According to Us Weekly, Kim snapped a photo of four products all from the luxurious La Mer brand — The Perfecting Treatment, The Concentrate, The Renewal Oil, and the iconic Crème de la Mer. The total cost for this high-end skin treatment? A whopping $1,230. That’s rent money, people.', 'For decades, La Mer has been the crème de la crème (no pun intended) when it comes to facial moisturizers. The brand’s website claims it has the power to completely ""transform the skin,"" and making it look ""virtually ageless."" With those statements, it’s no wonder La Mer is a longtime favorite of makeup artists and celebs, as well as the source of legend — Mariah Carey was once rumored to use La Mer as diaper cream for her babies and Jennifer Lopez was said to have applied the stuff on her body from head to toe.

Using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that there are no universal ""best times"" to share content on Facebook.', 'We analyzed the median traffic that articles received from Facebook three hours after they were shared. Using the median for all stories and a year’s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn’t skewed by outliers. Our analysis garnered some fascinating discoveries.', 'Firstly, when we compared three major publishers of national and international news based in South America, France and the U.K., we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profiles for each publisher.', 'As can be seen in the above chart, the South American publisher achieved best performance when sharing between 11am and 4pm, and poor performance at other times. The British and French publishers, meanwhile, achieved more consistent results throughout the day, although both experienced peaks in referral traffic at different times.', 'It’s clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category — optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience. One explanation for this could be that daily routines and behaviors vary between countries and cultures, which therefore impacts media consumption patterns.', 'The natural next question is whether there are country-wide best times for posting stories on Facebook. Could it be that readers in France all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the South Americans? Can there be specific guides per country?', 'We compared traffic data from that same French news publisher with a top-10 French sports publisher of similar size and found that while before 10am they achieved similar results, the curves then diverge. By early afternoon, the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic, whilst the sports publisher is in a pronounced trough.', 'Overall, the sports publisher’s traffic is more consistent, with fewer dramatic peaks and troughs, while the news publisher has clearly demarked periods when more readers are clicking through to their stories. Even for two publications of equivalent size working in the same country, there are stark differences in audience behavior depending on the subject matter of the content.', 'We also compared two similar publications in the same country and looked at the traffic profiles of two top-10 French news publishers. There were still crucial differences — when one publisher experienced a peak in share performance at 11am, it is in fact one of the worst times for the other publisher to be sharing.', 'Interestingly, there also seems to be significant variance based on article topic. We looked at 220,000 Facebook posts made by our publisher clients between March 20 and July 10, 2016, and sorted them according to the time of day at which they were shared. We then compared performance of posts based on whether the articles were about sports or technology. All shares were obtained using local time, in order to compensate for time zone differences, then normalized by average client performance and volume.', 'Again, there are important differences, and these nuances help us understand the characteristics of audiences and their varying appetite for particular content types at different times of the day.', 'But even these descriptions of the individual publishers do not do the subtlety of the data justice. To get the most accurate picture, a publisher would need to perform this analysis again on a real-time basis due to strong daily fluctuations. Indeed this is why many publishers now commit very significant resource to optimizing their performance — with large social media teams and even data scientists.', 'Featured Image: Nick Shepherd/Getty Images']",When’s the best time to share on Facebook?,"There’s all manner of advice and guidance on the web for online publishers looking to optimize their social media efforts: CoSchedule, Fast Company,..",,"['https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/messenger.jpg?w=150', 'https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/facebook-messenger.svg', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/b?c1=2&c2=6036210&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=1.3&cj=1', 'https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/crunch-network.jpg', 'https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/brandbastion_logo.png', 'https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript', 'https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/messenger-reactions.png?w=150', 'https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/logo.svg', 'https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/100x75.png', 'https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/techcrunch_transparent_google_editor_picks.png', 'https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/sport_technology.png?w=738&h=416', 'https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/frenchnewsandfrenchsports-1.png?w=738&h=416', 'https://img.vidible.tv/prod/2017-03/03/58b9fa77d85a105723655d89/58b9fad540752f4c6f8238c1_o_U_v1.jpg?w=300&h=170', 'https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/postingtime.jpg?w=738', 'https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/facebook-city-guides.png?w=150', 'https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/postingtime.jpg?w=764&h=400&crop=1', 'https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png', 'https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ap-data.png?w=150', 'https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/threenewspublishers_differentregions_version1.png?w=738&h=416', 'https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/twoleadingfrenchnewspublishers-1.png?w=738&h=416']",https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/10/whens-the-best-time-to-share-on-facebook/?ncid=rss,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': ""We don't know."", 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}","['It’s clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category — optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience.

It’s difficult to argue against that claim as more than 11,000 athletes will be competing in 28 sports and 42 disciplines for the event’s ultimate prize: the gold medal.', 'The ""podium value"" of the gold medal at the Rio 2016 Olympics is approximately $564 , based on the price of gold at $43.76 per gram and the price of sterling silver at 61 cents per gram, as of Thursday. This is in line with the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games (about $566, even though that medal was 31 grams heavier). However, it is a long way off from the approximate $708 record price of the 2012 London gold medal, due to the record high price of gold and silver at the time.', 'If the entire medal was made of gold it would be valued at nearly $22,000, which is why 1912 was the last time all-gold medals were awarded.', 'A total of 2,488 medals were produced for the Rio 2016 Olympics (812 gold, 812 silver and 864 bronze) by the Mint of Brazil. All of the medals are the same size and weight, with a diameter of 85 millimeters and a weight of 500 grams, making them the heaviest medals in the history of the Summer Olympics and tied for the largest medal in the Summer games. At least three Winter Olympic medals were larger and heavier.', 'Each of the 812 Olympic gold medals is plated with six grams of gold (the minimum required by the International Olympic Committee) with 99.9 percent purity. The remaining 494 grams is made of silver with 92.5 percent purity (the standard for sterling silver), according to the Mint of Brazil. The purity silver standard also is a minimum IOC requirement.', 'Each of the 812 silver medals contains 500 grams of sterling silver. The podium value is about $305. The 864 bronze medals contain 475 grams of copper (95%) and 25 grams of zinc (5%). The bronze medals have little intrinsic value.', 'For the first time in history, according to Rio Olympic officials, the medals are designed in a curved dome-shape, higher in the center, so the thickness ranges from 6 mm to 11 mm.', 'Sustainable Design', 'The medals were produced with methods that the Rio 2016 Olympic officials described as ""symbols of sustainability and accessibility ."" More than 30 percent of the silver used in the production of the medals are recycled from mirrors, waste solders and X-ray plates. The gold is mined entirely free of mercury. More than 40 percent of the copper used in the production of the bronze medals came from the industrial waste of the Mint of Brazil through a process that was developed internally.', 'Even the ribbons attached to the medals were well thought out with half of the materials woven from recycled polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET) yarn (recycled post consumer polyester made from bottles). Each medal comes with a sustainably sourced wooden box, certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, that contains a miniature sculpture of the Rio 2016 logo.', 'The front of each medal has the Rio 2016 logo framed by laurel leaves (which were given as awards for the ancient Olympics). The reverse reveals the traditional etching of , the Greek goddess of victory, in the foreground and the Greek Panathnaic Stadium in the background.

To understand why, she dug deeper into the personality assessments.', 'Self-control key', 'She found that realistic optimists believed they had more self-control and control over their interpersonal relationships.', '""Every time they face an issue or a challenge or a problem, they won\'t say \'I have no choice and this is the only thing I can do.\' They will be creative, they will have a plan A, plan B and plan C,"" Chou said.', 'That allows them to stay cheery and upbeat about the future, even if they recognize the challenges of the present.', ""Being a realistic optimist does have one downside, however: They are more prone to anxiety than their completely unrealistic peers. That's likely because they recognize the possibility of failure, whereas their counterparts use positive illusions to ease their anxiety, Chou said."", 'The findings suggest that realistic and unrealistic optimists may actually be very different personality types, Chou said.', 'In order to cultivate a rosy-but-realistic outlook, people should maintain a clear-eyed view of reality, but emphasize what they can control in most situations, she said.']","Realistic Optimists May Have More Success And Happiness, Study Suggests","By Tia Ghose, Staff Writer

Soon after, the theater where the ad was shown later claimed that the tease in the ad was a typo.

Overwatch is already short of villains and this can be a logical speculation, but anything cannot be confirmed until we hear it from Blizzard.', 'At this point we can certainly say that there’s something or someone called Sombra, which is directly or indirectly related to Overwatch, but it’ll be interesting to find out what Blizzard thinks on this.', 'We’ll update you as soon as we come across more news on this.

6cd0b2f4-2dbf-45e9-988c-887d1e3310dd,375094646113705985,hollywood didn't want to make this vin diesel movie,Twitter,"['Filmmaking in 2013: ""Riddick,"" the third Vin Diesel film to feature that title anti-hero, is an indie feature. That means even Vin Diesel -- who, thanks to the ""Fast and Furious"" movies, stars in one of the most popular film franchises in existence -- had to independently finance the third ""Riddick"" movie. How did he get here?', 'Let\'s start with ""The Chronicles of Riddick,"" the sequel to ""Pitch Black,"" which was released on June 11, 2004. The film, which cost around $110 million, grossed just $57 million at the North American box office, making it one of that summer\'s costly misfires. After that result it was understandable that a studio -- in this case, Universal -- was leery about putting more money into the franchise, even at this new film\'s reported bargain budgetary cost of $38 million.', 'Maybe, though, that was for the best. In this new installment, we find Riddick (Diesel) left for dead on a desolate planet. After a lengthy recuperation segment, the focus of the film shifts to a group of bounty hunters who are on the planet searching for Riddick. So, Riddick, the character, shifts from our hero to, as ""Riddick"" director David Twohy calls him, ""the bogey man."" It\'s something Twohy, who also directed the previous two installments, says would never have happened had this been a straightforward studio movie.', 'Did you ever think this third movie would ever happen after ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" underperformed?', 'Yeah, I had my doubts after the second one. And we suffered some slings and arrows. According to the studio, we spent way too much money and didn\'t make enough back. So, that\'s never a good formula. So, I had my doubts. If you speak with Vin, I\'m thinking he would say, ""Never a doubt that we were going to do a third movie"" -- because that\'s just the kind of guy he is. He is a big dreamer. I\'m more the pragmatist of the duo.', 'Vin Diesel has had quite the resurgence over the last couple of years.', ""Look, I've learned never to count Vin Diesel out. Just don't do that. And I guess it's because he is a very smart guy. Smarter than people give him credit for."", 'I enjoyed that in ""Riddick"" the stakes are big to the characters, but not compared to all of the big summer movies we just saw. These people basically just need to leave a planet and that\'s it.', 'And look, I\'ve been in those meetings, too. Where it\'s, ""We have to up the stakes. We have to give it a ticking clock"" ... So, I hope that ""Riddick,"" if nothing else, feels a little more handmade than factory-made. That\'s what I set out to do and Vin was certainly along for that ride, too.', ""The first half hour, we're pretty much alone with Riddick. Then the film focuses on the bounty hunters and Riddick becomes almost the bad guy, even though we spent the first part of the movie with him."", 'That\'s right. Now, that\'s something the studio would have fret out about. ""Wait a second. You are totally sympathetic with Riddick while he\'s trying to survive, but then you\'re using him as the bogey man.""', 'Why did you want to do that?', ""Because he is both those things. He is a man. He is a survivor -- a survivor with skills. And enough personal code that he can be sympathetic to us, but, at the same time, never let the audience forget that he's a stone cold killer. But, you know I think it works. Because I have to introduce those new characters ... I have like 10 new characters to establish. And I can bolster Riddick's roar -- his legend -- by having them talk about him as they glimpse him."", 'Do you think the success of the ""Fast and Furious"" movies helped to get ""Riddick"" made?', 'Yes. But, here\'s the cyclical nature of the business. Because ""Pitch Black"" did well, that allowed him to be part of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. And guess what? What goes around, comes around. So, on the basis of that, he was dropped into a major part in ""The Fast and the Furious."" And based on the success of that, yes, that does impact on our ability to launch this third one. Even though Universal didn\'t want to make it at a certain point. In fact, they didn\'t make it. Do you know that story?', 'I do not.', 'It goes like this. After ""Chronicles,"" they said, ""We are out of the Riddick business. It\'s just a straight business calculation of us. You spent too much money and you didn\'t make enough back. So, no, we\'re not going to do anymore."" Vin, being the savvy guy he is, said, ""Well, give me the rights back."" And they didn\'t want to do that ... I think this was about the time that ""Fast 3"" had already shot and they were testing it. Maybe it wasn\'t testing as well as it should have and they decide, ""Maybe we need a cameo from Vin"" -- because he wasn\'t in that movie. So, I do believe that in his savviness, Vin said, ""Don\'t pay me for that cameo. Just give me the rights back."" So, his company basically controls the rights and because I control all of the sequels and remakes. So, we can\'t make a movie without each other, nor would we want to. So, that\'s how he got the rights back and I think that was a great business move.', 'So, ultimately, we did it as an independent movie. I wrote a spec script. We sold it in Berlin for international. We came back into town looking for a domestic partner. I thought it was going to be Sony or Film District -- they were both eager to have the movie. And then, guess what? Universal raises their hand, ""Well, what about us?"" And I said, ""This doesn\'t feel right to me"" But Vin, he was saying, ""That was then, this is now"" ... So with the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise and his relationship with Universal over that and the strength of those, we placed it again at Universal. So, the company that kicked us to the curb [laughs] picked up the movie and will be distributing it in the U.S. and Canada.', ""So Universal didn't put any money into the film?"", 'They put money into it for their domestic distribution rights.', 'So Riddick is an indie film?', ""Here's an example of how it's an indie film. I wrote a spec script, we sold that. We went up to Montreal and I think I did one polish on my original script -- and then we shot that. Then, when it comes to editing, I got to the point when I wanted to show it to 50 people in a room, just to see what they understood: What was clear to them and what was not clear to them. Because of things aren't clear to them, the audience can't enjoy it and I still have time to go to the editing room and clean it up. I didn't have it scored and didn't fill out forms, I just stood in front of them and asked them questions ... I had the studio heads in once, but we were basically locked at that point. So, very pure filmmaking. Very pure."", 'Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment.

One of her secret savings accounts had grown to $900 behind her back.', 'Rhoads, a 37-year-old Los Angeles-based sales director for a jewelry line, has an account with Digit, a financial technology company with an algorithm that tracks users’ income and spending patterns. It painlessly spirits small amounts of money out of checking and into a savings account every two or three days. ', '""I just thought it was such a good idea, to set it and forget it,"" said Rhoads, who says she is ""like a squirrel"" in her approach to saving. Digit sends texts with balance updates, which she largely ignores because ""I like to pretend the saving is not happening."" ', 'Getting consumers comfortable with putting their finances on customized autopilot, starting with a simple, no-fee—and no-interest—savings account, is the San Francisco startup’s mission. In two years, its users have saved more than $350 million this way, according to its 31-year-old founder and chief executive officer, Ethan Bloch. When the product moved out of pilot mode, in February 2015, users were saving about $1 million a month; now that’s more than $35 million a month. Digit won’t disclose the size of its user base but says it has tripled from about a year ago.', 'Digit had a savings bot before bots were cool, or at least before the hype in the financial technology world reached a fever pitch. Its product is simple. An algorithm looks at a user’s average, high, and low checking account balance, when the user is paid, and whether the pay cycle is smooth or choppy. Then, after looking for bills due in the next week or two and analyzing recent spending, it moves an amount it judges the customer won’t miss to a savings account. The company makes money from the interest rate it gets on account assets.', 'Digit announced today that it will be the first savings bot on Facebook Messenger’s platform, so users can just use Facebook to communicate with it. When Digit moved out of its pilot phase, it communicated only by text, a natural language for many users, since 17 percent of them are aged 21 to 24, and 44 percent are from 25 to 34 years old. Rhoads said they’re ""cute texts"" with ""some personality"" and ""not annoying at all."" After text messaging came iOS and Android apps for users.', 'The company is now working on what Bloch called ""the first artificial intelligence-powered financial goal program."" Users would set a date and amount (and pick an emoji, of course), and Digit’s algorithm would make a series of projections based on balances to determine the optimal amount needed to start saving toward that goal—or point out that the goal is unrealistic.', 'Also on the product horizon is having Digit’s algorithm figure out how to ""move every dollar where it should go, at the right time, to minimize fees [on student loans, credit card  accounts, etc.] and maximize gain,"" Bloch said. ', 'There are hitches. Since Digit isn’t a bank, it can’t pay interest, and it will be competing in an environment of rising rates. Bloch said interest rates ""are not a huge deal"" for his customers, because they regularly withdraw money and tend to save small sums.', 'Another hurdle is that traditional bank technology can make it hard to connect accounts. ""Banks have not made it easy for customers to get their data,"" Bloch said. ""Because of that, Digit and products like Acorns, Venmo, Betterment—every day we have bank difficulties that affect thousands of customers.""', 'Behavioral finance underlies much of Digit’s design. Take the goal function, for example: If users get more specific about what they are saving for, research suggests, they are less likely to withdraw the money.', '""If an account is labeled \'Charlie’s Education Fund,\' I’ll think harder about withdrawing it than if it’s just labeled \'Savings,\'"" Bloch said. Currently, 70 percent of Digit users withdraw 80 percent of their savings every 90 days, mainly to pay bills and meet short-term needs for cash, to pay off debt, or pay for travel.', 'Bloch\'s broadest long-term goal is to make Digit’s user interface far more conversational, to ""humanize it"" so users feel more in control when they communicate with it.', '""We want to make Digit understand more—not as broad as Alexa or Siri, but widen the aperture a little more—related to finances and your money,"" he said. ""One day, it would be awesome to say, ‘Hey, Digit, am I OK for retirement?’ And all Digit does is send back a thumbs-up emoji.""', 'That kind of complex analysis won’t show up anytime soon. But after a Series B round of fundraising led by venture capital firm Ribbit Capital, Digit’s 22-person team is sitting on $25 million in cash. That, Bloch said, will let the company ""be somewhat protected for the next few years in pushing the envelope, largely to invest in product development. The big question for us now is, what more will our customers trust Digit to do?""

In fact, Lynyrd Skynyrd played a huge role in the success of another iconic band as they made their rise to fame; Los Angeles rockers Guns N’Roses, who thanks to these Jacksonville natives, achieved critical acclaim with their smash hit ""Sweet Child O’ Mine"" from 1987’s Appetite For Destruction – but how?', 'According to Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose, ""Sweet Child O’ Mine"" was directly inspired by Lynyrd Skynyrd; when crafting the song’s nostalgic, strangely romantic feel, Axl turned to Jacksonville’s finest for a lesson in how to write straight from the heart and make it mean not just something, but everything:', '""For ‘Sweet Child’...

They quit smoking using hypnotherapy. Celebrities have discovered the effective results of hypnotherapy and have used it to conquer their own smoking habits.', 'Researchers at the University of Iowa combined more than 600 studies of smoking cessation programs involving 72,000 people from North America and Europe1. Hypnosis was found to be over 3 times more effective than nicotine replacement therapy and 15 times more effective than quitting cold turkey.', ""A comparison study of smoking cessation treatments was conducted by North Shore Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital2. 26 weeks after discharge, 50% of patients who received hypnotherapy exclusively were non-smokers compared to the 25% of patients who didn't and only 16% of patients who used nicotine replacement therapy alone."", 'Types of Addiction', ""Smoking addiction is a combination of two types of addiction. There's the physical addiction, then there is the mental, or psychological addiction. Although nicotine addiction is considered one of the strongest addictions, even more addictive than cocaine, the good news is that the physical side of things doesn't last very long. In fact, some believe that you will lose the physical cravings for nicotine in as little as 3 days."", 'The real struggle for smokers is overcoming the mental addiction. The smoker has essentially trained their subconscious mind to make smoking an \x93automatic\x94 behavior. These are the habits and rituals that a smoker has developed over the years such as smoking when they wake up, just before they go to sleep, after they eat, when they drive, when they drink coffee or alcohol, and so on.', 'How Hypnotherapy Helps You Quit', ""So what will hypnotherapy do? Rather than just treating the physical urges that are part of your smoking habit, hypnotherapy targets the subconscious drive behind the addiction, and breaks the positive associations with cigarettes that the mind has formed. This is replaced by an empowering, smoke-free perspective the hypnotist offers through verbal suggestions that deem smoking as something undesirable \x96 or unnecessary \x96 to do. Gradually, these suggestions take hold and diminish the smoker's impulse to smoke. Furthermore, hypnotherapy is considered to be a far more safe and natural method to quit smoking with and is non-habit forming. This cannot be said about most of the stop smoking aids we currently have on the market."", ""But going to a hypnotist can be expensive. As much as $200 per one hour session, and requiring as many as 5 sessions for the entire treatment. If you're a celebrity like the ones mentioned earlier, then this isn't a problem. But can the average smoker afford to go to a hypnotherapist? Well, that question is left to the individual, but consider that a pack a day smoker will spend in excess of $2000 a year on cigarettes, not even including the increased cost of life and health insurance, and doesn't include the drastic cut in your ability to earn.""]",What is the easiest way to quit smoking?,,,"['http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/ads.jpg', 'http://bttrack.com/Pixel/Retarget/324', 'http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/call-to-action2.png', 'http://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=5441966&Ver=2', 'http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/small-1.jpg', 'http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/ybtlogo.png', 'http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/ps10_2.jpg', 'http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/ps10_1.jpg', 'http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/smoke1019062015.jpg']",http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/easiest-way-to-stop-smoking-10.php?eid=Mjg=&amp;var1=yav&amp;var2=[var2]&amp;var3=[var3]&amp;eid=11&amp;vid=55920240,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Be a rich celebrity.', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}",['Hypnosis'],"[[[3, 155], [3, 163]]]",['phrase']

21eb61d1-70b5-44ec-bd74-616ecd5f8027,533272568535711744,guess how much money bill gross made last year? exclusive by @ritholtz:,Twitter,"['How much compensation the folks at Pacific Investment Management Co., better known as Pimco, haul in each year has always been a topic of fascination on Wall Street.', 'In 2012, news reports suggested that the firm\'s top 30 partners ""pulled down an average $33 million a year in compensation in recent years."" A subsequent column by Felix Salmon guessed that the average investment professional at Pimco was making ""roughly $7 million each"" annually.', 'A Pimco spokesman denied Salmon\'s claim, responding that ""The numbers cited in your blog post today are wildly inaccurate.""', ""Salmon's speculation was, indeed, wildly inaccurate -- to the downside. Actual bonuses at Pimco are higher, much higher, than probably any outsiders previously believed. Based on news reports, public records and new data obtained by Bloomberg View, it appears that Pimco had a 2013 bonus pool for its 60 managing directors of almost $1.5 billion."", ""So how much have Pimco's top executives earned? According to documents provided to Bloomberg View by someone with knowledge of Pimco's bonus policies, the numbers break down like this: Gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013. Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco's former chief executive officer and one-time heir apparent to Gross, received $230 million (El-Erian is a fellow Bloomberg View contributor)."", ""And the story doesn't end with Pimco's two most visible (former) employees. Former deputy chief investment officer Daniel Ivascyn -- now serving as Gross's replacement as Pimco's chief investment officer -- took home a $70 million bonus. Wendy W. Cupps, the global head of product management, garnered $50 million, making her one of the highest-paid woman in finance. (Her rocky push into equities was the subject of well-publicized haranguing by Gross.) Douglas Hodge, now the CEO, took home $45 million of holiday cheer. These giant bonuses almost make the $22 million awarded to Pimco’s president, Jay Jacobs, seem puny."", 'The top three managers after Gross and El-Erian -- Ivascyn, Cupps and Jacobs -- were rumored to have been behind the coup that sent Gross packing to Janus Capital in September. Next month, free of Gross and El-Erian, these three will have an extra half a billion or so to keep to themselves or distribute to the other managing directors.', 'Gross’s bonus -- 20 percent of the total bonus pool for 2013 -- places him in a compensation class of his very own. To put that figure into context, in 2013 Gross made just shy of what the next 20 publicly held finance company CEOs made combined.', 'In the world of sports, you would have to take the total salaries, winnings and endorsement deals of LeBron James, Lionel Messi, Kobe Bryant, Tiger Woods and Roger Federer -- together -- to be on par with Gross.', '* * *', 'How Pimco became such an earnings machine is a quirk.', 'It has been four decades since it was spun out of Pacific Life Insurance Co., a move that was made in part to allow Gross a freer hand to manage the insurer’s fixed income portfolio. Since then, Pimco has grown into a behemoth, in terms of the bottom line and as a force in the bond market.', ""Much of what we know about Pimco stems from Allianz SE's $3.3 billion purchase of 70 percent of the firm in 2000. A publicly traded German insurer, Allianz has released some details about Pimco’s operations in its quarterly earnings reports. That data, along with mutual fund disclosures and filings, provide hints about the firm’s revenue."", 'We can estimate earnings by looking at the largest Pimco funds. The 20 biggest have an average fee of about 61 basis points. Let’s lower that to account for discounts given to large institutional clients, and we get a rough estimate of about 50 basis points. On $1.82 trillion dollars, that yields $9.1 billion in revenue a year.', 'Pimco is, by any measure, a fabulously wealthy company. Using my back-of-the-envelope revenue estimate, it generates far more revenue per employee than any bank or asset manager -- almost four times as much as Goldman Sachs.', 'When Allianz bought into Pimco, it picked up about $250 billion in assets under management. Pimco currently manages about $2 trillion.', ""The bonus structure is a quirk of that original deal: Allianz’ partial purchase left Pacific Life owning 30 percent of Pimco. But Pacific Life wasn't interested in running the asset-management business and even after the Allianz deal, everyone involved continued to defer to Gross’s financial and managerial judgment."", ""Thus Pimco -- based in Newport beach, California, and 6,000 miles removed from its majority owners -- remained fully autonomous. Bloomberg View's fee analysis suggests Allianz takes about 70 percent of the total revenue Pimco generates annually (plus or minus a few percentage points). Pimco keeps the rest."", 'This same deal structure continued even after Allianz purchased the 30 percent of Pimco that it didn\'t already own from Pacific Life in the mid-2000s. A subsequent restructuring in 2011 saw Gross and his team gain even greater control over the firm. That gave Pimco so much freedom in relation to its corporate parent that, as one analyst described it to Bloomberg News, it appeared as if it was ""the tail wagging the dog.""', '* * *', 'Part of the reason for Gross\'s longevity after the Allianz takeover -- and another element of the firm\'s enormous wealth -- is what we might call the ""Pimco Premium."" Despite being in a competitive field including giant companies such as Vanguard and Blackrock, Pimco manages to charge more than the industry standard for access to its funds and its separately managed accounts.', 'Why? When competing for business, the firm has had an unbeatable combination of a long history and outstanding long-term results. (At least it did, until recent bad bets on rising interest rates by Gross torpedoed the 1-, 3- and 5-year record of the flagship Total Return Fund.)', ""Pimco also became the go-to company for the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury in many of the credit facilities used to combat the continuing economic fallout from the financial crisis. Pimco's success in the federal government's program to jumpstart consumer lending and a variety of mortgage-backed security programs added more luster to its reputation. Gross even managed to buy up lots of MBS's before the Fed officially announced the programs. Shareholders of the Total Return Fund netted about $10 billion from its mortgage plays."", ""Beyond the sheer size of Pimco's bonuses, there are other aspects of its compensation practices that should give pause to everyone involved in institutional asset management."", ""For one, Pimco has been part of a publicly traded company -- Allianz -- for the past 15 years. Unbeknownst to Allianz's shareholders, employees of one of its business units have been paying themselves these extraordinarily large sums of money."", 'In the U.S., it is hard to imagine $1.5 billion in spending on anything not being disclosed. Almost 16 percent of Pimco\'s revenue is a ""material"" amount of money that would normally require disclosure in the U.S. But Allianz is a German company, subject to different regulations.', ""Another item worth noticing: Pimco investors represent pension funds, foundations, charitable trusts, 401ks and other retirement accounts. Pimco's enormous, self-paid bonuses come right off of the top of the returns those outside investors might otherwise receive."", 'In a recent Allianz presentation following Gross\' departure from Pimco, the firm\'s new chief executive, Doug Hodge, stated, ""We don\'t comment on matters of compensation.""', ""But while Gross may be gone, the high fees and compensation structure at Pimco appear to remain firmly in place. Allianz doesn't seem inclined to change things -- it started a $279 million award program this fall to keep people from following Gross out the door."", ""However, if there is going to be change, it can only come from Pimco's big institutional customers. Why should they pay a Pimco Premium? Pimco's profits are down by 7.9 percent in the third quarter of this year, and the firm saw saw almost $50 billion in outflows last month. Janus, Gross's new home, has managed to attract only about $430 million in new money since he joined."", 'The market for fixed income asset management has never been in greater flux than it is today. The realignment of power among bond managers is only just beginning. If ever there was a moment when investors could demand more competitive fees from their bond managers, it is now.', 'Perhaps it might also be a good time for Pimco itself to consider slicing its fees. Anecdotally, stories abound of Pimco institutional salespeople offering steep one-year fee discounts as a way to retain assets.', 'If I were managing Pimco (even from 6,000 miles away), I would be looking at ways to make those fee reductions more permanent. I bet I even could find close to a billion and a half dollars in savings.']",Guess How Much Money Bill Gross Made Last Year?,The numbers break down like this: Gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013.,"Money,Earnings,Investment Management,Wall Street,Bond Market,Fixed Income,Sports,California,Wealth,Interest Rates,Federal Reserve,U.S. Treasury,Retirement","['http://assets.bwbx.io/images/idaOcRVeUxoY/v1/120x120.jpg', 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKzjInUDN4qE/v1/1200x-1.jpg', 'http://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKzjInUDN4qE/v1/1200x-1.jpg', 'http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iz9_DLhdXefQ/v1/120x120.jpg', 'http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i1JWQKZPC96A/v1/120x120.jpg', 'http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iui7bQYay2Cc/v1/120x120.jpg', 'http://assets.bwbx.io/images/izgCxnl7Ri4I/v1/120x120.jpg', 'http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ijfX17VuNa34/v1/120x120.jpg', 'http://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iK2WFiEHsevU/v0/120x120.png']",http://bv.ms/1ut6B6e,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': '$290,000,000', 'spoilerPublisher': 'SavedYouAClick'}",['$290 million'],"[[[4, 198], [4, 210]]]",['phrase']

Instead of telling a morbid, freighting tale about a dystopian future, creator - and the episode’s writer - Charlie Brooker decided to tell the wonderful love story of two women. **Spoilers ahead**"", 'In the episode, the wonderfully awkward Yorkie - played by Mackenzie Davis - falls helplessly in love with Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) while partying at the Californian beach resort San Junipero. This is no ordinary love story, though, as the pair mysteriously meet each other in different time periods over a number of weekends. How? Because San Junipero isn’t a real place: it’s a realistic virtual reality; a place the consciousness is uploaded to rather than physically visited. ', 'It transpires that Yorkie - despite appearing to be in her 20s in San Junipero - is actually an elderly, paralysed woman, living in an assisted living facility with only six months left. Kelly, meanwhile, is actually based in a separate retirement home, seeing out her days in San Junipero. ', 'Eventually, after overcoming some reticent feelings, the pair meet up in real life and marry so Kelly can formerly authorise Yorkie’s euthanasia, putting her out of her pain. Yorkie is then uploaded to San Junipero. Kelly, however, rejects Yorkie’s advances to also fully upload her consciousness to San Junipero once she dies because of a promise to her previous husband. After months of deliberating, and a worsening condition, Kelly decides to upload her consciousness to San Junipero, living out her days with Yorkie.', 'Written down, it sounds like a semi-morbid tale of death. Yet, what transpires is a heartfelt tale of two women who decide, in spite of everything, to be together, their love overwhelming rational thinking. Is there really anything more life affirming than a love story where love reigns triumphant?', ""Well, there’s one issue. As the episode finishes, there’s a lasting shot of the computer servers keeping Yorkie and Kelly’s consciousness ‘alive' - the ‘TCKR’ system.

But this modest herb could make cows’ methane-heavy belches — a big contributor to the warming of our planet — a little less potent.', 'Oregano’s essential oil contains carvacrol, an antimicrobial that kills off some of the methane-producing bacteria in the cow’s rumen. Danish researchers who are investigating oregano’s methane-suppressing abilities hope that it could reduce cows’ methane emissions by a quarter. Nearly 15 percent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to livestock, and 65 percent of that total comes from raising beef and dairy cattle.', 'NPR points out that oregano oil isn’t the only solution to cutting down cows’ ballooning emissions. Scientists have explored unpronounceable alternatives like 3-nitrooxypopanal, a methane-inhibiting chemical. But those may not be compatible with organic guidelines, and many of the people who care about cows’ methane emissions are the same ones who buy organic milk.', 'We could just eat less dairy and beef. But while some Americans are starting to shift away from meat, that change may not happen soon enough.

Every neighborhood has its ramen shop at this point. Now, it has overtaken tobacco as the number one currency in US prisons, The Guardian reports.', 'According to a study done by Michael Gibson-Light, a doctoral candidate at the University of Arizona, decreasing quantity and a decline in quality of food served to US prisoners have made the food a commodity. And the noodles are being traded for a lot more than they’re worth. At the prison used for the study, a package of ramen runs for 59 cents at the commissary, but at inmate stores, which are illegal, they can go for much more. A sweatshirt that costs $10.81 can be traded for two packs of ramen. Prisoners also clean each others bunks for packs of ramen, or gamble with it. The change is a signifier of a major problem with nutrition in prisons. ""[Money] doesn’t change unless there’s some drastic change to the value in people using it,"" Gibson-Light said.', 'He attributes ramen’s popularity to the fact that it’s ""easy to get"" and ""high in calories,"" something of value to people who ""spend their days working and exercising."" They need the energy.', 'Ramen has been popular in prison for a long time. Gustavo ""Goose"" Alvarez who spent more than ten years in prison wrote a book about it called Prison Ramen: Recipes and Stories From Behind Bars. It includes recipes that can be made with items available to prisoners, such as tamales ""Doritos, canned pork and beans, and ramen,"" and celebrity ramen recipes.', 'It’s not all trading and food hacks, though. When something is valuable and being traded on a sort of black market, things can get tricky. At inmate stores, people often buy things on credit. When credit isn’t paid, it leads to problems.

This is despite the fact that the U.S. added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012.', '""The big story is that everything was stagnant over the year"" said Economic Policy Institute’s Elise Gould. ""We’re stagnant, and continue to be in a bad place.""', 'While the economy continues to struggle, residents in the wealthiest states continue to make far more than in the poorest. In 2012, Maryland remained the richest state in the country, with a median household income of $71,221. Mississippi was again the poorest, with an income of $37,095 — nearly half that of Maryland’s.', 'Despite the addition of jobs nationwide, median incomes remained stagnant in most states and were still generally below their 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation. Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, explained that this has been the nature of the recovery. ""We have an economy that continues to grow, with most of the gains going to the economic elite. I don’t see any bright prospects for the median worker, much less the poor.""', 'States with lower median incomes generally had much higher rates of poverty than the national rate. All of the 10 states with the lowest median income in 2012 also had among the highest poverty rates in the country. While 15.9% of Americans fell below the poverty line in 2012, nearly one in four Mississippians did.', 'Employment is one of the biggest factors affecting income. In some states with lower unemployment, a higher share of the households had steady income, which bolsters the state’s median. In many of the highest-income states, like New Hampshire, Minnesota and Hawaii, unemployment in 2012 was less than 6%, compared to a national rate of 8.1%.', 'Elise Gould, Director of Health Policy for Economic Policy Institute, explained that unemployment rates can have a significant effect on a state’s household income. ""When we’re talking about average families and poor families, the vast majority of income comes from wages. So it’s about jobs."" Gould cautioned, however, that unemployment rates do not tell the full story.', 'Unemployment rates, for example, ignore those people who have given up looking for work or accept part-time work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while 8.1% of American workers were unemployed in 2012, 14.7% were underemployed, meaning they wanted to work full time but could not. This was an increase from roughly 10% in 2008.', 'The types of jobs available in each state also affect income. A review of Census Bureau industry composition data shows that people in most of the states with a higher median income were often more likely to be employed in information, finance, professional and other positions that tend to pay higher salaries. Maryland, the wealthiest state in the country, had the highest percentage of workers in professional, scientific and management positions.', 'At the same time, many of the low-income states had smaller percentages of these professional occupations and higher rates of employment in retail, manufacturing and transportation. The high proportion of manufacturing jobs in low-income states might be surprising, but, explained Danziger, the makeup of the manufacturing industry in the country has changed.', '""There’s a difference between unionized auto company workers and non-unionized parts suppliers,"" Danziger said. ""Even when manufacturers haven’t cut wages, they are adopting labor-saving technological change.""', 'To identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state data on income from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2012 American Community Survey (ACS). Based on Census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation.

Garrett Pope, an 11-year-old sixth-grader from Indian Land, accidentally killed himself in an attempt to play the game. The game involved cutting off his airway.

However, we have to keep in mind that this is a Ghostbusters reboot, and not a straight-up remake. So these characters won’t have the exactsame traits as the original team.', 'As for the supporting cast, we already know some details about their characters. Andy Garcia is playing the mayor of New York City, Michael K. Williams is a character named Hawkins, Matt Walsh is a character named Rourke (I could easily see him working for the mayor), Chris Hemsworth is the new secretary for the Ghostbusters, and Saturday Night Live writer Neil Casey is the film’s villain. And let’s not forget that Dan Ayrkoyd also confirmed that he’ll have a cameo in the film in a scene with Kristen Wiig.', 'Honestly, as someone who is a massive Ghostbusters fan (I have an entire wall with action figures and original artwork), this is something that I’m not very worried about anymore. As with any reboot or remake, a new take on the material won’t take away from how much I love the original movies.

But they weren\'t.', 'It was invading texts, instant messages, email and even in-person dialogue. The slash was being vocalized where it might otherwise appear in written form, integrated smoothly into audible discussion. Since we aren\'t yet giving other punctuation the same treatment (""Hello exclamation point"" still sounds odd), it didn\'t make much sense.', 'After so much time being delegated to such boring utilitarian functions as dates (""8/30/2014"") and fractions (""3/4 cup""), the humble slash mark seems to be getting a linguistic makeover. Anne Curzan, professor of English at the University of Michigan, described the practice among students in her classroom last year. Since then, Curzan told me in an email, she\'s been studying examples of slash usage on Twitter. The most common use corresponds most closely to ""and/or,"" but she said a fair number are ""used to connect one idea to another, perhaps meaning something like \'following up\' or as something like a spoken semi-colon."" Still, other examples use the slash as a way to indicate ""truth values for the elements it connects,"" Curzan explained. In other words, saying one thing when what you really mean is the next. Like saying you need to rest when what you\'re really planning is binge-watching TV.', 'Grammatically speaking, outside of its role as punctuation, the slash also functions as a ""coordinator."" Coordinators, also called coordinating conjunctions, include ""and,"" ""but,"" ""or"" and other words that function to link independent and dependent clauses.', 'English speakers are pretty comfortable with this idea, as Geoffrey K. Pullum, professor of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, explained on his blog back in 2010. For example, we might invite our friend/roommate to go see ""Boyhood"" while planning to stuff our purse/backpack/pockets with cheap candy. Our meaning is clear. The person with whom we share a responsibility for rent is also our friend, and whatever discreet container we bring to the theater will help us avoid paying five dollars for a box of Sour Patch Kids. The slash helps us present alternative descriptions. Pullum suggested, however, that it really only makes sense in ""lexical rather than phrasal categories.""', '""With clauses,"" he wrote, ""I think there is no possibility of using it at all: consider \'I think I\'m having hallucinations slash someone is playing tricks on me.\' Doesn\'t seem like English at all, does it?"" These days, many English speakers would disagree. Curzan explicitly noted that the slash can now be used to connect full clauses.', '""The most interesting implication to me,"" she said, ""is that this coordinator is expanding in use ... and taking on new meanings.""', 'Usage guidelines are, of course, still very restrictive in formal writing. When the style guides and writers\' handbooks I consulted mentioned the slash at all, they called it ""rarely necessary."" A 1977 edition of Theodore Bernstein\'s ""The Careful Writer"" referred to the simple ""and/or"" as ""a visual and mental monstrosity that should be avoided.""', 'Tell that to anyone who considers themselves a ""slash DJ,"" to indicate their interest in the turntable arts outside of a regular nine-to-five. (Writer-slash-DJ. Financial-consultant-slash-DJ. Animal-whisperer-slash-DJ.) Or to Jezebel editor Kara Brown, who described Robin Thicke\'s ""Paula"" as the singer\'s ""most recent album slash lame ass attempt at gaining publicity saving his marriage.""', ""While it'd be difficult to pin down exactly why we started going slash-crazy, it sure seems to correspond nicely with our culture of digital communication. Abbreviated by a lack of time or screen space or both, our technology has allowed instant messaging to flourish, so we might make our always-important thoughts known as quickly as possible."", 'The slash works as a stand-in, whether written or spoken, helping the writer express multiple ideas without going through the trouble of stringing them together using appropriate grammar, or else risking a series of awkwardly short bullet-point sentences. However strange ""I\'m going for a run slash walk in the park"" sounds to your ear, it gets across the same basic message as the much wordier alternative, ""I\'m going to run in the park but probably do a fair amount of walking, too, because running is hard."" Using ""slash"" assigned more ""truth value"" to ""walk"" over ""run."" The slash gives us a perfect opportunity to say two or more things at once like this, especially if one or more of those things is our own unsolicited snarky commentary. (""Friendship slash rivalry."" ""Review slash indictment."")', 'In digital scenarios where time is of the essence, it might seem counterintuitive that typing ""slash"" in the written form would so often take the place of the shorter and equally comprehensible ""and"" or ""or"" if convenience is such a concern. So maybe it speaks, then, to our comfort with digital communication tools like keyboards and touch screens. Typing is second nature to us, and the slash is an almost mindlessly simple way to link our related thoughts. It\'s a match made in, um, some factory in China.', ""Breakfast slash lunch! Yum! @ Max's Restaurant, SM Mall of Asia http://t.co/oSSwgVkLA4 — Uriel Yu Medellin (@itsmeuriel) August 4, 2014"", 'But will it stick around?', 'We can\'t say. To certain linguists, though, change is actually a great sign. Change means that people are using a language, and using a language keeps it healthy. (There\'s not a lot of new slang being formed, for example, in Latin.) But everyone owns the English language -- or, maybe, no one does -- and we\'re not that great at sharing. If it is, in fact, here to stay, some grammar-sticklers will undoubtedly be scandalized at the prospect of a new coordinator, which Curzan called ""a category of words that doesn\'t often show much creativity and/or admit new members.""', ""Correction: This story has been amended to reflect the correct spelling of Geoffrey K.

For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 feet.', '""To lower the cabin altitude, we actually increased the air pressure inside the cabin,"" Emery added. ""It\'s a bit counterintuitive for most people.""', 'Why does air pressure matter to passengers?\u200b', 'For most of us, a long flight is usually followed by some combination of symptoms that include headaches, lack of appetite, lack of energy, nausea, and sleeplessness.', ""All of these afflictions have been conveniently bundled together with a disruption of one's internal body clock to form something we call jet lag."", 'But the reality is that jet lag is far more serious.', 'The very symptoms we attribute to jet lag may actually be attributed to acute mountain sickness, which affects individuals exposed to altitudes above 6,500 feet.', 'In a study conducted by Oklahoma State University with the help of Boeing, researchers wrote:', '""Some passengers on long commercial flights experience discomfort characterized by symptoms similar to those of acute mountain sickness. The symptoms are often attributed to factors such as jet lag, prolonged sitting, dehydration, or contamination of cabin air. However, because barometric pressures in aircraft cabins are similar to those at the terrestrial altitudes at which acute mountain sickness occurs, it is possible that some of the symptoms are related to the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and are manifestations of acute mountain sickness.""', 'In 2015 Boeing annouced it had made the lightest metal ever', 'The study found that passengers who go from sea level up to 8,000 feet of altitude saw the oxygen content in their blood fall 4%. Although this didn\'t trigger full on acute mountain sickness, it did bring on what the study called ""increased prevalence of discomfort after three to nine hours"" of exposure.', '""The research showed passengers\' bodies reacted at 6,000 feet similar to that at sea level,"" Emery said. ""So we decided to pressurize the Dreamliner at 6,000 feet.""', 'At 6,000 feet, the cabin air is more dense and has a greater level of oxygen saturation. As result, the body does not have to work as hard to oxygenate blood and sustain itself.', ""According to Emery, since there isn't a perfect one-to-one correlation between altitude and jet lag, Boeing has taken additional measures to mitigate the symptoms. These measures include an increase in cabin humidity as well as a new air-filtration system."", ""Why haven't we had this all along?"", ""The Dreamliner won't be the only Boeing jet to have a have a lower cabin altitude. The company's upcoming 777X wide-body mini-jumbo jet will also be pressurized at 6,000 feet."", ""However, unlike the composite Dreamliner, the 777X, Boeing's successor to landmark 777, will be primarily made of aluminum."", '""Aluminum aircraft can be pressurized to 6,000 feet,"" Kent Craver, Boeing Commercial Airplanes regional director of passenger satisfaction, told Business Insider in an interview. ""In fact, most business jets are already pressurized to that level.""', 'In addition, Airbus is also working to lower the cabin altitude on its next generation of airliners.', 'Airplane makers have traditionally avoided lowering the cabin altitude because boosting the air pressure inside the cabin puts greater stress on aluminum airframes. This increases the likelihood of metal fatigue and shortens the service life of the airplane.', 'However, Boeing believes it can successfully lower cabin altitude on the 777X without going to a composite body.', '""We know the 777 fuselage, its structural qualities, and its fatigue margins really well,"" a Boeing spokesperson told us in an email. ""We also understand the requirements of the lower cabin altitude in terms of cycles and pressures on the fuselage. As a result, we can achieve it with a few local reinforcements and change those loads out to accommodate lower cabin altitude.""', 'The Boeing 777X is set to enter service in 2019.']",Boeing is making a major change to its planes that could solve the biggest problem with air travel,"During the development of the 787 Dreamliner, Boeing encountered countless engineering hurdles.

Photo via Getty', 'Reports on the income inequality gap and the separate lives of the wealthy and the poor have become depressingly rote. The rich are not like you or me: They can buy their way into exclusive clubs, special social networks, even elitist sex parties. The poorest people in America are now on average not making enough to meet their basic needs—that sounds pretty bad, but can I interest you in a $700 juicer?', ""In that context, the publication, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), of a new study that looks at income and life expectancy after age 40 contains no bombshells. The report, covered widely by the New York Times and pretty much every other outlet on Monday, drills down into how income and longevity correlate. The richest 1 percent of men lives, on average, 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women that gap is ten years. But the ability of money and the things it buys—access to better medical care, leisure time, healthier food—to stave off death is well known. The big finding from Stanford economist Raj Chetty and his seven co-authors is not that rich people live longer, it's that the life expectancies of Americans in poverty varies wildly depending on where they live."", 'Here\'s how the Times summarizes it: ""The poor in some cities—big ones like New York and Los Angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like Birmingham, Ala.—live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century. But in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like Rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter.""', 'For the wealthy, it doesn\'t matter where they live—they seem to have the access to the same sorts of advantages wherever they go. ""It is as if the top income percentiles belong to one world of elite, wealthy US adults,"" wrote Nobel Prize–winning economist Angus Deaton in an article that accompanied the study in JAMA, ""whereas the bottom income percentiles each belong to separate worlds of poverty, each unhappy and unhealthy in its own way.""', 'The obvious question, then, is what makes those individual islands of scarcity more or less healthy than other communities? That\'s beyond the scope of the paper, but it\'s clear that the answer isn\'t simply that some places have fewer or worse doctors. ""The JAMA paper found that several measures of access to medical care had no clear relationship with longevity among the poor,"" noted the Times. ""But there were correlations with smoking, exercise, and obesity.""', 'The places where the poor lived the longest include New York and San Francisco—rich cities that can afford to provide a lot of services and have proactive public health departments. San Francisco was a pioneer in smoking bans; New York abolished trans fats. Poor people in and around Birmingham had a surprisingly high life expectancy, but there too there has been an investment in health services, according to the Times, and banned smoking in restaurants and other places in 2012.', 'Any study like this comes with some caveats. One reason poor people in major metropolises have longer life expectancies could be that they have higher proportions of immigrants, who tend to live longer than native-born Americans. Some people have lower incomes because their poor health damaged their earnings power, not the other way round. And the authors adjusted the statistics for race and ethnicity in order to correct for racial differences in life expectancy (for instance, black people generally live less long than whites), something they\'ve been criticized for. ""Social marginalization is not reducible to single variables,"" wrote Steven Woolf and Jason Purnell in a JAMA editorial. ""Race/ethnicity is inseparable from the economic consequences and stress associated with segregation, past and present marginalization in the distribution of resources, structural racism, persistent poverty, and violence.""', 'But if we accept the broader findings here, there seems to be almost a trickle-down affect when it comes to long life and health. In poverty-pocked areas in the Midwest and the South, poor people die sooner; in other words, in places that lack the services and infrastructure that wealthy big cities usually provide, people are less healthy.', '""Health is about more than healthcare,"" Woolf and Purnell wrote. Good schools, crime-free neighborhoods, childhoods spared the trauma of family dysfunction, and other factors all contribute to whether someone is happy and healthy as an adult, or whether they\'re trapped in that old cycle of poverty begetting stress begetting illness begetting more poverty.', ""Seen from this angle, inequality looks like not just a matter of unfair numbers but a public health problem.

Because they're super salty, they're better used as condiment than as the main event. For an umami boost, try grating them just like cheese over pasta, salads, avocado toast, popcorn, or even scrambled eggs."", ""Currently, cured yolks aren't even available in the most upscale grocery stores, so you'll have to make your own. Even better if you're raising chickens at home and have your own fresh eggs on hand. Fortunately, the process couldn't be easier. Here's how:"", '1. Start by combining 1 cup salt and 1 cup sugar in a bowl. Mix well to combine. Place half the mixture in a small baking dish.', '2. Separate 4 egg yolks, saving the whites for another use. Carefully place each egg yolk on top of the salt-sugar mixture, and gently sprinkle the yolks with the rest of the salt-sugar mixture. (This photo shows the eggs before they were completely covered. You want them to be totally submerged in the salt-sugar mixture.) Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 4 days.', '3. Remove the egg yolks from the fridge after 4 days. Use a pastry brush to gently brush the salt-sugar mixture off of the egg yolks. Run the yolks under cold water to wash any of the remaining salt-sugar mixture off.', '4. Place the yolks on a paper towel to drain and pat off any excess water. Transfer the yolks to a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake them at 150 degrees for 2 hours.', '5. At this point, the eggs yolks should be semi-firm and look sort of like dried apricots. Use them right away, or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks.', ""*In case you missed the memo, egg yolks are totally good for you.

A student of Cuba's Conservatory of Music, Cruz's career took off in 1950 when she joined La Sonora Matancera, one of Cuba's most prominent dance orchestras."", ""The singer left the island while on tour with La Sonora Matancera in 1960, shortly after the Cuban Revolution, and never returned. The Cuban government refused to let her visit the island to attend her father's funeral years later, according to The New York Times."", 'It was in the United States that Cruz would become an international icon and earn the moniker ""The Queen of Salsa,"" after launching a solo career with percussionist Tito Puente, and performing with the Fania All Stars in the 1970s.

066a1e96-d8cb-4314-be5e-d5446ce05509,827761870916423680,ottessa moshfegh's stories of selfish people doing foul things are must-reads,Twitter,"['The protagonist of ""Malibu,"" the third short story in Ottessa Moshfegh’s new collection, spends his time making up job applications so he can continue to receive unemployment benefits and try to coax money out of his aging uncle, who has a colostomy bag and does little but eat fatty meals in front of daytime TV. He’s handsome but pimply and given to throwing up after eating; he daydreams of the beautiful woman he’ll one day fall in love with, but treats the real women he meets like inconveniently sentient Kleenex.', 'Oh, and then there are his hands. ""As good-looking as I was, I was scared nobody would ever marry me,"" he admits. ""I had small hands. They were like a girl’s hands, but with hair. Nobody marries men with hands like that."" When he goes to a meet-up he’s planned with a strange woman, he shoves his hand down her throat, enjoying that he can see how his intrusive hand bulges her neck. He recalls taking a prostitute to a motel room: ""I sat down next to her and splayed my hands out on the bed. ‘What do you think about these?’ I asked. Nobody ever gave me the answer I wanted. Nobody ever said, ‘Oh, so beautiful!’""', 'Moshfegh’s fiction is nothing if not distinctive. As in her debut novel, Eileen, the narrators of the 14 stories in Homesick for Another World are gloomy, narcissistic and self-pitying. Their lives are claustrophobic and squalid. They’re constantly squeezing their acne, having sex with people they despise, eating candy and drinking until they’re sick, developing meth addictions just for kicks, and always feeling slightly superior to their own surroundings despite their listless lives. They crave adoration, but look on anyone who gives it to them with contempt.', 'In one story, a man obsesses over a woman who works at a video game arcade he frequents. He finally manages to secretly court her via text, but quickly loses his interest in her once she seems attainable: ""He took out his phone and reread all her texts again. ‘I am very lonely and troubled. Who are you?’ She sounded desperate, he thought. He had made a grievous mistake, he thought.""', 'In a story called ""The Beach Boy,"" a man’s wife dies suddenly after their 29th anniversary celebration on a tropical island. Initially devastated and adrift, he then catches sight of an unfamiliar face in the photos he developed from the trip. Though it’s out of focus and context-free, he’s convinced that it was a picture taken by his late wife ― of a male prostitute from the island. Suddenly, he’s revolted by her, the woman he thought was a lady, but who he’s now certain was unfaithful. ""Marcia was gone for good now,"" Moshfegh writes after her ashes were disposed of, ""and he felt like celebrating.""', 'The women in Homesick for Another World are equally self-involved and dismissive of their romantic partners. In one story, a woman lives with her boyfriend, who manages a dingy apartment complex while pursuing his dream of acting. She quietly loathes him, the way he clenches his muscles constantly to stay in shape, his devotion to a crystal skull he keeps by his bed, the yellow women’s blazer he bought secondhand and considers the height of manly fashion. He develops a meth addiction. She never really tries to leave. In another story, a high school English teacher spends her summers in a dying small town, subsisting on subs and drugs. She has a brief fling with a local: ""I still remember the humility it took for me to agree to take him home."" She hires a heavily pregnant young woman to clean her home, then calmly ignores it when her housekeeper begins to hemorrhage on the job.', 'The unpleasant, even grotesque behaviors of her characters seem amplified thanks to Moshfegh’s cool, matter-of-fact prose. In either first-person or close third-person narration, the blunt, unemotional words with which her characters relate their petty cruelties, addictions, and even bodily functions never ceases to be slightly jarring. In much fiction, writers draw us in by painting the relatable, lovable vulnerabilities within even their most nominally unsympathetic characters, complicating our impulse to divide the world into ""good"" and ""bad."" Moshfegh’s stories do the reverse, confronting readers with the squicky, selfish, and sociopathic inner selves of even outwardly decent people. ', 'Reading Homesick for Another World offers a similar experience to watching a dark comedy, like the British sitcom ""Peep Show."" There’s something refreshing and funny about her unvarnished portrayal of human squalor, but also something unsettling and difficult to swallow. It’s not a book to reassure readers of the essential goodness of the human race; it’s a queasy jolt to our optimistic selves, a reminder of the lowest, most id-driven proclivities of humanity. This may sound unappealing, yet Moshfegh’s talent is a sheer delight ― and the heedless misbehavior of her characters is a reminder, needed now more than ever, that we’re not such an elevated species as we’d like to think, and that following our base impulses can lead us nowhere fast. ', 'The Bottom Line:', 'Moshfegh’s stories of selfish people doing foul things capture the dark side of human nature, which is easy but self-deluding to ignore.', 'What other reviewers think:', 'The New York Times: ""If there’s a thematic thread weaving through this collection, it’s the complicated relationship between entrapment in the physical body — her characters are often probing, picking and searching with their fingertips, as if seeking beauty and potential grace — and entrapment in social landscapes.""', 'NPR: ""There’s not a story in Homesick for Another World that’s anything less than original and perfectly constructed. Moshfegh’s talent is unique, and her characters — unfiltered, cold, frequently pathetic — are all the more memorable for their faults and obliviousness.""', 'Who wrote it?', 'Ottessa Moshfegh has previously published a novel, Eileen, which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and was given the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award. After her book, a noir novel about a miserable and self-loathing young woman who works in a detention center, was nominated for the Man Booker Prize, she notoriously confessed to The Guardian that she’d written the book as a joke to get attention. She has published her short fiction in The Paris Review and The New Yorker, among other outlets.', 'Who will read it?', 'Fans of shocking, provocative fiction starring intensely disagreeable characters ― and readers who don’t mind being grossed out.', 'Opening lines:', '""My classroom was on the first floor, next to the nuns’ lounge. I used their bathroom to puke in the mornings. One nun always dusted the toilet seat with talcum powder. Another nun plugged the sink and filled it with water. I never understood the nuns. One was old and one was young. The young one talked to me sometimes, asked me what I would do for the long weekend, if I’d see my folks over Christmas, and so forth. The old one looked the other way and twisted her robes in her fists when she saw me coming.""', 'Notable passage:', '""Her pretty, gleaming calves appeared between the rungs of the banister as she came down the steps. She’d folded the cuffs of her leggings up above her knees, which were red from kneeling on the floor. When her thighs appeared, I saw a black stain of blood at her crotch. She seemed not to know that she was bleeding. There was no way she could have seen the blood past the mountain of her belly, I suppose. She gripped the bucket with one hand and the railing with the other as she descended the stairs.', '""’Oh, shit,’ she said when she reached the landing. ‘I forgot the broom.’""', 'Homesick for Another World By Ottessa Moshfegh Penguin Press, $26.00 Published January 3, 2017', 'The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book.']",The Bottom Line: 'Homesick For Another World' By Ottessa Moshfegh,Ottessa Moshfegh's stories of selfish people doing foul things capture the dark side of human nature.,"bottom line,Literature, fiction,writing,romance movies,Teen Fashion,Man Booker Prize,Biographies (Books),homesick for another world",,,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': None, 'spoilerPublisher': None}","['""Malibu,""', '""The Beach Boy,""', 'Homesick for Another World', '']","[[[0, 19], [0, 28]], [[4, 18], [4, 34]], [[2, 116], [2, 142]], [[0, 0], [0, 0]]]",['multi']

The veterinary procedure has been offered for many years, but that could cease to be the case, at least in New York, if legislation to ban the practice goes though.', 'For those who don\'t own cats, declawing may sound like simple nail clipping, but it\'s a very serious medical operation. Medically referred to as an onychectomy, declawing a cat is essentially amputation. Feline nails, unlike ours, are attached to their bones. To remove them, vets have to cut through tendon and nerves in order to fully remove the nail and bone. The human equivalent, as the Human Society of the United States describes it, is ""cutting off each finger at the last knuckle.""', 'The gravity of the procedure is why lobbyists are hoping to make it illegal in New York. ""It\'s the equivalent of taking a cigar cutter and cutting the end joint off,"" veterinarian Jennifer Conrad, who helped lobby for the cause, told a Daily Freeman reporter. Kristine Brabson, site director of GoodHousekeeping.com and devout cat lover (she has six of them), strongly opposes declawing. ""It\'s torture to cats. Why would Mother Nature give your cat claws, for you just to pay to rip them out?""', 'Most Popular', ""Many cat owners opt for the procedure to avoid a cat's destructive behavior, particularly against their furniture. To that, assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, who is sponsoring the bill, says:"", '""I\'ve heard so many times: \'I have expensive furniture! I have nice drapes!\u200b If your standard is, \'I need pristine furniture,\' don\'t get a cat.""', 'The controversial practice is already banned in Los Angeles, Australia, Britain and many countries in Europe. This ban marks the first time the issue has reached statewide level in the U.S, the Associated Press reports.', 'Meanwhile, many veterinarians understand the concern regarding the procedure, but disagree with a ban. ""None of us love the procedure. But when the alternative is condemning the cat to a shelter or to death? That\'s why we do it,"" says veterinarian New York City Richard Goldstein. The American Veterinary Medical Association supports the procedure, but ""only after attempts have been made to prevent the cat from using its claws destructively or when its clawing presents an above normal health risk for its owner(s)."" Still, 130 New York vets are completely supportive of the ban.', 'The bill is currently with the Senate and Assembly, but no voting date has been determined, reports the Huffington Post.', '(h/t Daily Freeman)']",Cat Claw Removal,"New York is looking to ban cat declawing.

He spoke publicly about his sexuality for the first time to The New York Times and ESPN on Sunday."", '""I am an openly, proud gay man,"" Sam told ESPN.', ""The 24-year-old from Hitchcock, Texas revealed to both outlets that he had come out to his teammates during a preseason football practice before the Tigers' 2013 campaign."", '""I understand how big this is,"" Sam told ESPN. ""It\'s a big deal. No one has done this before. And it\'s kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.""', 'A 6-foot-2, 255-pound senior who was voted co-defensive player of the year in the vaunted Southeastern Conference for the 2013 season, Sam made his announcement just two weeks before the NFL Scouting Combine begins on Feb. 22 in Indianapolis.', '""We admire Michael Sam’s honesty & courage,"" the NFL said in a statement released on Sunday, via Ian Rapoport of NFL.com. ""Michael is a football player. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in NFL.""', 'Sam recounted for The New York Times the moment when he came out to his teammates during a team-building exercise at preseason practice last year.', '""I looked in their eyes, and they just started shaking their heads -- like, finally, he came out,"" Sam said.', ""After coming out to his teammates and coaches during the preseason, Sam starred on the field as the Missouri rolled to a 12-2 record and a 41-31 win in the Cotton Bowl. Given the type of year that Sam had, he was rated as the 12th-best outside pass rusher available in the upcoming NFL draft by ESPN Scouts Inc. and projected to be a mid-round selection. With the NFL's readiness for its first active openly gay player an open question, Sam's draft position will be watched closely in May. Several unnamed NFL personnel members interviewed by Sports Illustrated after Sam's announcement believed that coming out would adversely affect his draft stock."", '""I don\'t think football is ready for [an openly gay player] just yet,"" an anonymous NFL player personnel assistant said, reported Pete Thamel and Thayer Evans of Sports Illustrated. ""In the coming decade or two, it\'s going to be acceptable, but at this point in time it\'s still a man\'s-man game. To call somebody a [gay slur] is still so commonplace. It\'d chemically imbalance an NFL locker room and meeting room.""', 'The general manager of one NFL team told Peter King of Sports Illustrated that he believed Sam would not even be drafted after coming out. Meanwhile, GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis contended that the leadership displayed by Sam should make teams eager to have him on the roster.', '""By rewriting the script for countless young athletes, Michael has demonstrated the leadership that, along with his impressive skills on the field, makes him a natural fit for the NFL,"" Ellis said in a statement. ""With acceptance of LGBT people rising across our coasts -- in our schools, churches, and workplaces -- it\'s clear that America is ready for an openly gay football star.""', ""Should any NFL executives or coaches with questions turn to Missouri head football coach Gary Pinkel for answers then they will likely hear about Sam's desire to keep the focus on football and the example he set for this teammates."", '""We’re really happy for Michael that he’s made the decision to announce this, and we’re proud of him and how he represents Mizzou,"" Pinkel said in a statement. ""Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he’s taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn’t matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we’re all on the same team and we all support each other. If Michael doesn’t have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, I don’t think there’s any way he has the type of season he put together.""', ""One of Sam's former teammates at Missouri, Trey Hobson, was also among those expressing support for him on Twitter."", 'Shout out to my former Teammate Michael Sam.

His plans were accelerated after unnamed scouts at the Senior Bowl in January were asking about his sexuality."", '""At the Senior Bowl, it was the first question I got from the scouts almost every time,"" one of Sam\'s agents, Joe Barkett, told Outsports. ""He didn\'t feel there was an agenda behind the question other than trying to determine if the word on the Internet was true. ""They would ask about spending time with him, were there girls around? Who is his girlfriend? They didn\'t ask that about another client, Tom Hornsey. They only asked it about Michael.""', 'Wanting to come out on his own terms, Sam altered his initial timetable, eventually speaking with ESPN and The New York Times on Sunday. After the news broke, Sam took to Twitter to thanks those who helped him in coming out.', 'I want to thank everybody for their support and encouragement,especially @espn, @nytimes and @nfl. I am proud to tell my story to the world! — Michael Sam (@MikeSamFootball) February 10, 2014', 'While Sam was thankful for the support he received, Athlete Ally Youth Programs Director Akil Patterson was among those noting the impact that this pioneering decision could have on others.', '""Having played Division I football as a closeted gay man, I recognize the game-changing potential here for athletes everywhere, "" Patterson, a former standout offensive lineman at the University of Maryland, said in a statement. ""If Michael Sam can navigate this transition into the NFL as an out man of color, it will open doors for young people everywhere, particularly in football. More athletes will feel comfortable being true to themselves at a younger age and that will translate into better performance on the field and in the classroom. I think we have the capacity to go from one trailblazer to a large community of players within a surprisingly short period of time.""', 'Although several former NFL players have come out after retiring and it was widely presumed that there are currently gay players in the league, there has never been an openly gay player. In April 2013, veteran NBA center Jason Collins came out with a first-person piece in Sports Illustrated. The 35-year-old was entering free agency and did not find a new team for the 2013-2014 season. A month later, former U.S. national soccer team player Robbie Rogers became the first active openly gay player in a major professional North American team sport when he stepped onto the field for the L.A.

If you’re finding that figure hard to envisage, it’s the equivalent of 119m meals, and an increase of 4% on the year before. From this we can deduce that Tesco’s voluble commitment to reducing its edible detritus has yet to yield results. But is Tesco any worse in this respect than any other supermarket chain? Probably wisely, the others don’t publish their waste figures, but let’s just assume that if they had a better story to tell us, we’d already know all about it.', 'Tesco’s waste tally is certainly grotesque, but PR executives expert in techniques for smoothing over corporate difficulties would doubtless applaud the masterly way Tesco deflected criticism. On the day that his chain’s depressing results were published, chief executive Dave Lewis addressed a food industry summit where he exhorted food manufacturers to do more to reduce their waste across the supply chain.', 'After deftly passing the waste ball back to his supply base, Lewis reprised a favourite supermarket refrain: blame the consumer. ""While the majority of food waste arises from the home, industry recognises the need to lead by example."" There you have the dramatis personae in Tesco’s food waste script: profligate consumers, suppliers who earn a ""must work harder"" rating, and enlightened Tesco, leading the vanguard in the national war on waste.', 'Just in case you aren’t finding the plot line 100% credible, a further emotional strand is woven in: Tesco promises to redistribute all its unsold edible food to charities from 2017. Putting a gloss on your waste problem by repackaging it as a food poverty solution is a tactic increasingly deployed by our major supermarkets. Ideally, from a supermarket PR point of view, the term ""food poverty"" would appear in every headline that contains ""supermarket food waste"", for that allows our giant retailers to bask in the role of philanthropists who use their corporate might for the common good. It places a halo of saintliness around all their business activities.', 'But a waste prevention strategy should never be confused with a poverty reduction strategy. Crumbs from the rich man’s table is a shallow, and too easily self-aggrandising response to the unacceptable reality that millions of fellow citizens can’t afford to eat good, fresh food. What’s more, the red herring of food poverty draws attention further away from one essential fact about supermarkets we must digest if we are ever to make any progress: waste is hard-wired into the supermarket system.', 'When the supermarkets began colonising the UK grocery market in the early 1980s, they appeared to be a newer, more efficient way of feeding the nation. They promised vast economies of scale by virtue of their collective buying power and state-of-the-art distribution logistics that would bring every agricultural product on the planet to our shelves, 365 days a year. This precision shopping model, we were assured, would produce dividends for consumers in the form of lower prices and more convenient shopping. Who needs parades of small, independent shops when chains can feed us so much more efficiently, and for less?', 'Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese; now we live in dread of food poisoning', 'Four decades on, it’s becoming obvious that supermarkets are incapable of delivering this promise. Why? They are retail dinosaurs, locked into a system that’s riddled with problems.', 'One such glaring issue is food waste. Far from discouraging it, the supermarket business model actively begets it.', 'There aren’t, to my knowledge, any robust statistics on levels of food waste in British households before the supermarket era, but I’d hazard a guess that they were much lower than they are now.', 'Our rubbish bins really started filling up when, instead of shopping for a little, as was needed, every day or two, we were persuaded to adopt the one-stop supermarket shopping trip. Theoretically, armed with a list, we could buy all the food we needed for a week. Nowadays, supermarket online ordering makes that even easier to do. Just press the same-as-last-week option. So supermarkets egg us on to overlook what we already have and to buy much more than we need. They encourage us to hazard a weekly guess about what we’ll consume, rather than focusing on what’s in our fridges and larders day-to-day.', 'If the untouched remnants of last week’s order are stacking up in the fridge when the supermarket van arrives at our door, most people will consign them to the bin, schooled to believe, thanks to supermarket use by and best before dates, that judging freshness is best left to distant experts. Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese, now we live in dread of poisoning. Better safe than sorry, surely?', 'But sell-by dates – the progenitor of use by and best before – were introduced by supermarkets as stock rotation tools, to help clunky, mammoth chains keep tabs on the unprecedented amount of product passing through their system, not primarily as safeguards against food poisoning.', 'Undoubtedly, certain foods sold by supermarkets do pose a very real risk to health. Around two thirds of their raw chickens are contaminated with potentially lethal campylobacter at the point of sale, even though they are well within their use-by dates. Yet again supermarkets point the finger of blame at the stupid, sloppy home cook who fails to slay the bacteria through thorough cooking, rather than eradicating infection at their factory farms.', 'And don’t forget that supermarkets have actively undermined our national food handling experience and skill by telling us that we’re too ""time poor"" to cook from scratch, largely because it is much more profitable for them to sell us value-added, processed foods whose apparent freshness is validated by reassuring dates. The bottom line here is that such dates are absolutely no guarantee that food is truly fresh or safe, yet they shape our daily decisions about what we eat and what we bin.', 'Battalions of quangos, non-governmental organisations, government agencies and charities see supermarkets as allies in the war on food waste, but in reality, they are a huge part of the problem. If we are to stop waste at source, we must look to and learn from the burgeoning grassroots initiatives that aim to relocalise and scale down our food chain.']",We shoppers aren’t to blame for food waste.

Nighttime exposure to artificial light -- which for the great majority of us happens without much thought or awareness -- disrupts the body's circadian rhythm, altering the 24-hour biological clock that controls our sleep-wake cycle. In addition to wreaking havoc with sleep, disruptions to circadian rhythms also have been associated with a number of serious diseases, including cancer, diabetes, depression and heart disease."", 'In particular, research in recent years has shown that blue wavelength light is especially harmful to circadian rhythm function. Studies have shown that blue wavelength light has uniquely harmful effects on humans and suppresses melatonin levels more vigorously than other light wavelengths. Unfortunately, many energy-efficient light sources produce high concentrations of blue light. Blue light is emitted by electronic devices, energy-efficient light bulbs, and other common light sources.', ""Research investigating blue-light blocking -- most often in the form of goggles that filter out this particular wavelength of light -- has shown promise. A new study of cataract patients indicates that artificial lens implants can help improve sleep. Scientists at China's Sichuan University studied the effects of blue-light blocking artificial lenses implanted during cataract surgery. The study involved 40 patients who required surgery for cataracts in both eyes. Cataract surgery commonly involves removal of the eye's damaged lens and insertion of an artificial lens. Cataracts are a common condition among older adults -- approximately 60 percent of people over the age of 60 experience cataracts. The study subjects -- 26 women and 14 men, with an average age of 74 -- were given artificial lenses with blue-light blocking capability. Researchers assessed patients sleep quality before surgery and again two months after surgery. They found patients' sleep had improved significantly across several measures:"", 'Patients were sleeping more during the night.', 'Their sleep quality had improved.', 'Their levels of daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness had diminished.', 'The number of subjects who met the criteria for ""poor sleepers"" had decreased.', 'Lens replacement surgery is necessary for cataract patients. But there are other, less-invasive ways to filter out blue-light that are also being investigated by sleep scientists. Research has shown the benefits to sleep of manipulating and controlling exposure to blue light:', 'A study of 20 adults who wore either blue-light blocking or ultraviolet-light blocking glasses for three hours before sleep found that both sleep quality and mood improved among those in the group who wore blue-light blocking glasses, compared to the ultraviolet-light blocking group.', ""Shift workers are at especially high risk for circadian rhythm disruptions because of their non-traditional schedules. In a study by scientists at Quebec's Universite Laval, nightshift workers used blue-light blocking glasses at or near the end of their overnight shifts for four weeks. At the end of study period, their overall sleep amounts increased, as did their sleep efficiency."", ""While nighttime exposure to blue wavelength light is damaging to circadian rhythms, exposure to blue light isn't always detrimental. Daytime exposure to blue light can stimulate alertness and help sleep later on. A study of 94 office workers found that daytime exposure to blue light during work hours resulted in improvements both to sleep and to daytime functioning, compared to exposure to white light. Subjects who were exposed to blue light experienced improvements to daytime alertness, mood, and concentration. These subjects also experienced decreases in daytime sleepiness and they slept better at night."", ""This area of research is critically important, and I expect we will see a great deal more investigation into the effects of blue wavelength light on sleep and health. But you don't need special goggles or eye lens implants to protect your circadian rhythms and your sleep from the negative effects of artificial light. Here are some low-tech suggestions that can help you:"", ""Limit exposure to artificial light in the hours before bed. The last 1-2 hours before bed should be a time of winding down and preparing for sleep. Decreasing your exposure to light is an important part of this process. You don't have to sit in a pitch-black room, but you should think about beginning to limit your exposure to bright lights, whether from your computer screen or your television. Reading under moderate lamplight is fine. If you're using a tablet to read, bring the screen's brightness level down. Make the last 60 minutes of your bedtime ritual electronics-free -- and keep electronic gadgets and devices out of the bedroom altogether."", 'Get light exposure during the day. Daytime exposure to light -- both sunlight and artificial light -- can help strengthen circadian rhythms and boost daytime alertness, leaving you better prepared to sleep when the time comes.', 'If you need access to light in the middle of the night, use small nightlights. Rather than switching on hallway or bathroom lights -- and flooding your system with melatonin-suppressing light -- use low-illumination night lights to guide you when you need to get up in the dark.', 'Being aware of the effects of nighttime exposure to light and making some basic changes to bedtime routines can go a long way toward getting you the darkness you need to sleep well, even in this ever-bright modern age.']",Blocking Blue Light Helps Sleep,The disruptive effects of artificial light on sleep are well,"light in bedroom,nightlight,blue light blocking lens,The Sleep Doctor,light exposure,circadian rhythm,electronics and sleep,Sleep Tips,sleep expert,Sleep Advice,bedtime routine,sleep habits,artificial light and sleep,Dr. Breus,blue wavelength,Electronics in Bedroom,blue light,michael breus,sleep,blue light sleep,artificial light sleep,blue light and sleep","['http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rWTZ2PAKL._SL160_.jpg', 'http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QKMIg7HvL._SL160_.jpg', 'http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1361999/images/o-BLUE-LIGHT-SLEEP-facebook.jpg', 'http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript', 'http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/ShopIndieRed.png', 'http://assets.huffingtonpost.com/amazon-sidebar.gif', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1']",http://huff.to/1eBEXfW,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'Blue.', 'spoilerPublisher': 'HuffPoSpoilers'}",['blue'],"[[[1, 55], [1, 59]]]",['phrase']

The site spits out a seemingly never-ending bucket list of things we absolutely must do before we die: places to see, books to read, urinals to pee in. And as we all inch closer to our imminent deaths, BuzzFeed creates more and more of these articles, making it seemingly impossible to accomplish all of these things before we kick the can."", ""If you're as young and bored as I am, though, you might wonder: Could you pull it off? Could you actually check everything off the BuzzFeed bucket list, and if so, how long would it take? A little while ago, I set out to find out for myself. Here's how I did it:"", 'First, I had to compile all of the lists BuzzFeed has published in its ""Before You Die"" format. At the time I filed this story, there were 182 lists. These ranged from appreciating the little things in life (like watching the sunset) to full-blown adventures (like going to South Africa\'s version of Burning Man). BuzzFeed writers also seem obsessed with food, since practically every other list is about stuffing your face with 21 amazing Aussie burgers or the ten best New Orleans po-boys or the 15 best cheese toasties in London.', 'Next, I cataloged each task on each of the 182 lists. There are over a thousand individual tasks.', ""On Motherboard: Counting the Hours I've Spent on the Internet"", ""Next, I calculated the time it would take to complete each of the tasks. This is where it all got slightly more complicated, since the time it would take to do most of these things is highly individualized. Eating fish and chips, for example—how long does that take the average person? If you were really vying for time, you could probably scarf some down in five minutes, but I'd much prefer to spend an hour savoring of a nice, greasy plate. And what if the restaurant was really busy and it took a long time for your server to bring the fish and chips to you? I settled on 30 minutes for eating fish and chips, as well as the other food-related tasks."", ""Other tasks required a fair amount of research, like hiking the Camino de Santiago, otherwise known as St. James' path, between Spain and France, which is less like a path and more like a pilgrimage. The trail is nearly 500 miles long. According to the trail's official website, it takes four to six weeks to complete. I decided to allot 30 days to complete the trail, even though the website also noted that you would need to hike 18 miles per day without any rest days to finish the trail in that time, which seems completely insane."", ""I repeated this process for every single task on Buzzfeed's lists. Again, there are over a thousand individual tasks."", 'Here is a time table showing a small sample of the time I allotted for certain tasks:', 'Some of the lists contained fast, easy tasks that be completed entirely from your couch—like this one, which requires you to look at 20 pictures of miniature pigs before you die—but for most of them, you have to travel. Some of the lists, like the Five Highest Places to Visit Before You Die, require you to jet-set from the Haiku Stairs of Oahu, Hawaii to the Petronas Towers of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to the Taihang Mountains in China. In order to accomplish all of the tasks most effectively, you would need to travel the world. So I decided to calculate the travel time that it would take to work your way around the world, in an order most efficient for accomplishing each of the BuzzFeed tasks.', ""I decided to begin my hypothetical bucket-list journey in Boston, where I live, and work my way west through North America. I would visit 36 states in the United States and stop in Canada and Mexico along the way. Then onto the Dominican Republic to explore the three shipwrecks of Bayahibe, followed by stops at Turks and Caicos, and Belize. Some stops later, I'd spend 175 hours and ten minutes flying from country to country in Europe, stopping in Estonia to see the beech tree in Hiiumaa before taking a quick ten-minute flight over to Finland to go to the Kontula indoor skatepark in Helsinki. I'd make my way over to Turkey to swim in the crystal blue mineral waters of the Pamukkale Springs in Hierapolis and then pop over to Jordan to grab a drink at the Cave Bar in Petra."", 'I whittled the travel time down to one-hour flights over borders, stopping in some countries for only a few minutes to visit a bakery or for a few hours to watch a sports game. In total, the round-the-world trip would take 26 days in travel time alone, and would include 108 countries.', ""The last thing I calculated was sleep time. I figured a person would be fairly tired after spending months on end climbing mountains, reading plays, and visiting museums every day, so I allotted the doctor-recommended eight hours per night. I really enjoy sleeping, so this is painful for me to even imagine, but when you're racing to finish an extensive bucket-list in the fastest amount possible, I suppose luxuriating in the REM cycle shouldn't be a priority. I also factored in how long it took me to calculate the trip—around 40 hours in total—and how long it would take to actually book the flights, hotels, and day-trips, which would be possibly twice that."", ""In conclusion—drumroll, please—I determined it would take 1,448.7 days to do everything that BuzzFeed says you need to do before you die. That's 207 weeks, or just shy of four years."", ""I'll repeat that some of the timing calculations were arbitrary. You could get stuck in a restaurant with poor service and it might take double the time to eat your fish and chips, or you could arrive somewhere like the Trinity Church on King George Island in Antarctica and decide it was too boring to stay the full hour. Your flights could get delayed, or you could get food poisoning at one of the restaurants and choose to bail on the next day's activities. If you got the timing wrong, you might miss the small window when all 39 Christmas markets on the list are open, or arrive at the Mendenhall Ice Caves in Juneau, Alaska, to find that they have all melted."", 'But if you planned it just right and you had the time, money, and stamina to accomplish everything on the list, then you could definitely do it.', ""That said, I'm not sure why anyone would want to. There are a lot of things on that list that I, personally, have no interest in doing. Why should I visit 39 different Christmas markets across Europe? I mean, I'm sure they're beautiful and each have nice hot chocolate and giant, neon candy canes, but what's the harm in not seeing all 39 of them? Is it really worth the hours it would take to learn all 44 of these air guitar songs? Would I really be a lesser person for not having visited these 19 penis-shaped objects around the world?"", ""I'm not saying I wouldn't do it. If someone offered me the chance to travel the world and see some of the coolest things this Earth has to offer, I'd be hard pressed to say no. Of course, I'll probably die before that happens. BuzzFeed has a handy quiz for that, too.""]",We Calculated How Long It Would Take to Do Everything BuzzFeed Tells You to Do Before You Die,"Could you pull it off?

According to new findings from the Pew Research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse who\'s been married before. In 20 percent of new marriages, both spouses have previously said ""I do.""', '""There\'s so much dialogue right now about the retreat from marriage in general,"" Gretchen Livingston, Senior Researcher at Pew and author of the study, told The Huffington Post. ""I was really curious to juxtapose that with what\'s going on with remarriage.""', 'Livingston analyzed data from the 2013 American Community Survey as well as the 1960 and 1980 censuses and found that the number of remarried adults in the US has hit 42 million, which is almost double the amount recorded in 1980 and triple the amount in 1960. But not everyone is jumping to remarry -- after combining the hard data on remarriage patterns with the results of a recent Pew survey about marriage, Livingston found that specific demographics are actually less likely to remarry than others.', 'Among those who are divorced or widowed, age made a big difference in desire to remarry.', 'There are two demographic shifts that can account for this general surge in remarriage, according to Livingston. For one, the divorce rate is higher now than it was in 1960, so the number of people who are, as she put it, ""eligible"" to remarry has also risen. (But it\'s worth noting that the divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has been slowly declining and leveling off ever since.)', 'The more influential factor in the high remarriage rate, however, is a longer life expectancy for partners, particularly among baby boomers. While only 34 percent of those who were 65 and older (and eligible to remarry) had remarried in 1960, 50 percent of that same demographic had remarried in 2013.', '""The older you are, the more likely you are to have ever remarried, because you have more time in your life to have married once, gotten divorced or widowed and found someone else and remarried,"" Livingston said.', ""Younger Americans went the opposite direction: 75 percent of people ages 25 to 34 and eligible to remarry were remarried in 1960, while only 43 percent of that same demographic were remarried in 2013. It's very possible that this younger group of contemporary divorcees and widows hasn't soured on the institution of marriage completely, however. Livingston pointed out that, since younger demographics have tended to delay marriage -- the average age of first marriage is now is about 27 for women and 29 for men, as opposed to 21 for women and 24 for men in 1960 -- perhaps this group is content to cohabit with partners or advance the relationship in other ways, rather than jump into marriage number two."", 'Overall, women were less likely than men to want to walk down the aisle again.', ""Age wasn't the only differentiating factor, though. When Pew polled participants for the aforementioned survey on marriage, they asked single men and women who had been married before if they would be willing to marry again. There was a clear gender divide: Divorced or widowed men were more likely to want to remarry than women in the same position."", ""A majority of once-married, eligible men -- 65 percent -- either expressed a desire to remarry or were still considering it. In comparison, 43 percent of women said they'd be willing to remarry and 54 percent specifically didn't want to ever marry again. Only 30 percent of men were completely against the idea of a second walk down the aisle."", ""Previous studies have suggested that men enjoy more health benefits, relationship satisfaction and economic perks from marriage than women do. Livingston said it's quite possible that widowed or divorced men have more motivation to jump back into a new marriage and regain those aforementioned comforts."", ""Another interesting finding combined both age and gender: In remarriages, 16 percent of couples involve a husband who is at least 10 years older than his wife. This age gap falls to a mere 4 percent in first-time married couples. If you consider that 39 percent of first-time newlyweds (and 21 percent of remarried couples) are within a year of each other's ages, this age gap among remarried couples becomes particularly noteworthy."", ""But don't make too many assumptions about newlyweds -- it's a demographic that's still in flux."", ""While today's divorce rate might make newlyweds of the 1960s cringe, that doesn't mean that today's society has lost faith in marriage. In fact, according to Pew, previously married people these days are just as willing to remarry as they were back in 1960. Taken together, these findings can add more detail to an ever-shifting image of the American family."", '""Maybe newlyweds don\'t look quite as fresh-faced as they did in the late \'60s,"" Livingston said, noting once again that 40 percent of today\'s newlywed couples involve at least one person who\'s been married before.

The main living space stretches a generous 35 feet and combines the kitchen, dining and lounge areas. There’s a wood-burning fireplace sheathed in hand set slate tiles, and the smallish but sleek kitchen accommodates a full-range of snazzy high-quality appliances, including an integrated espresso machine.

The master suite, set privately away from the other bedrooms and lined on at least two walls with stunning, matchbook pattern wood paneling, includes a dressing hall lined with wardrobes, a laundry closet with full-sized machines and a windowless bathroom with poured concrete two-sink vanity, ebony tiled walls, a heated towel rack and a glass-enclosed multi-head shower.', 'This is not the first high-priced New York City rental for the former ""Dawson’s Creek"" star who produced and co-starred in the recently released silver screen drama ""Mania Days"" and who will portray Jacqueline Kennedy in an upcoming TV miniseries (""The Kennedys After Camelot"").

""As soon as I learned about a genderqueer identity, I was like, ‘Oh! That’s the one!’"" said Gieselman, who frequently ends sentences with a gentle laugh. ""Before, it had been really difficult to explain how I was feeling to other people, and even really difficult to explain it in my own head. Suddenly, there was a language for it, and that started the journey.""', 'Gieselman dumped the girlie name bestowed at birth, asked friends and teachers to use Rocko, the tough-sounding nickname friends had come up with, and told people to use ""they"" instead of ""he"" or ""she."" ""They"" has become an increasingly popular substitute for ""he"" or ""she"" in the transgender community, and the University of Vermont, a public institution of some 12,700 students, has agreed to use it.', 'While colleges across the country have been grappling with concerns related to students transitioning from one gender to another, Vermont is at the forefront in recognizing the next step in identity politics: the validation of a third gender.', 'The university allows students like Gieselman to select their own identity — a new first name, regardless of whether they’ve legally changed it, as well as a chosen pronoun — and records these details in the campuswide information system so that professors have the correct terminology at their fingertips.', 'For years, writers and academics have argued that gender identity is not a male/female binary but a continuum along which any individual may fall, depending on a variety of factors, including anatomy, chromosomes, hormones and feelings. But the dichotomy is so deeply embedded in our culture that even the most radical activists had been focused mainly on expanding the definitions of the two pre-existing categories.', 'Today, a growing number of students are embracing the idea that when it comes to classifying gender, there should be more than two options — something now afforded by the dating website OkCupid and by Facebook, which last year added a tab for ""custom"" alongside ""male"" and ""female,"" with some 50 options, including ""agender,"" ""androgyne,"" ""pangender"" and ""trans person,"" as well as an option for controlling who can see the customized version.', 'Activists on campuses as diverse as Penn State, University at Albany, University of Chicago, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and University of California, Riverside, are laying claim to a degree of identity freedom nearly unimaginable when the first L.G.B.T student centers were established. Today’s students, who grew up with Gay-Straight Alliances in their high schools, with transgender people represented in the media and with transgender rights percolating through the courts, arrived on campuses already L.G.B.T.-friendly and, in many cases, equipped with gender-neutral housing and bathrooms.', 'In hopes of raising consciousness of the biases built into social structures and into the language we use to discuss them, students are organizing identity conferences and inventing new vocabularies, which include pronouns like ""ze"" and ""xe,"" and pressing administrations to make changes that validate, in language, the existence of a gender outside the binary.', 'Certainly, there’s a long line of people throughout history whose traits have put them outside norms, and some cultures long ago formalized the existence of a gender that isn’t purely female or purely male, like the American Indian’s two-spirits or India’s hijras. But the binary is a belief system at least as old as Adam and Eve, and most people don’t even realize it’s there. ""It’s like a constant coming-out process, educating those around you that there is a gender binary, and this is what it means to identify outside of it,"" said Gieselman, who works on campus planning gender-related events.', 'Identifying as genderqueer is an opportunity to self-invent, unburdened from social expectations about dress and behavior. Occasionally Gieselman wishes for a lower voice and flatter chest, but other times feels O.K. with, even happy about, having a feminine physique.', '""Even within the same day or the next day I can suddenly really love how my chest looks in a sundress,"" said Gieselman, who wears two small nose rings. In the bedroom closet hang T-shirts, flannels, dresses and a rack of bow ties.', 'It might seem a simple turn of events, but adding gender-neutral options to the University of Vermont’s information system took nearly a decade of lobbying, the creation of a task force of students, faculty members and administrators, and six months and $80,000 in staff time to create a software patch.', 'One key to the developments is Dorothea Brauer, a plain-spoken, big-hearted mental health counselor known to everyone as Dot. Ms. Brauer spent nine years working at the campus counseling center before becoming, in 2001, the director of what was then called the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning & Ally Center.', 'While in her 20s and living in New Jersey, Ms. Brauer, who wears her hair cut short with a single, long braid down her back in tribute to a Cherokee grandmother, was spending time with a woman when an acquaintance changed the course of her life by inquiring about the relationship, and then pointedly but nonjudgmentally asking, ""Honey, are you gay?""', '""I said, ‘Well, yeah, but only with Anita,’ "" recalled Ms. Brauer. (Anita would turn out to be her life partner — 32 years and counting.) ""That’s how clueless I was,"" she said, chuckling over a taco salad lunch at the Penny Cluse Café in downtown Burlington. ""I was 24, 25, and scared to death. I came out to my mother, only my mother, because I became physically ill with depression.""', 'A decade later, as one of the few out women on campus in the 1990s, she treated students with debilitating identity issues, some of whom attempted suicide or faced a psychotic break. (L.G.B.T.Q. youth are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide as their heterosexual peers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Ms. Brauer’s first act upon being installed as the center’s director was to assign a graduate student to research and catalog the unmet needs of the transgender community.', 'Among the difficulties faced by transgender students: inability to use bathrooms marked ""men"" or ""women"" for fear of a confrontation with a confused classmate; being accused of using a stolen student ID in the cafeteria because the name printed on it didn’t match someone’s gender appearance; and having the faculty rely on a student-information system that listed only legal names, leading to occasions when a student might be embarrassed or inadvertently outed. Ms. Brauer heard about one distraught transgender freshman whose professor, while calling roll, first read the student’s feminine legal name, then announced the male nickname.', 'Ms. Brauer reached out to the registrar, Keith P. Williams, who worked with the university’s lawyers to allow transgender students to change their first name in the schoolwide system, but doing so required an in-person visit to the dean of students’ office and filling out paperwork. She then set to work waging a campaign to educate, face to face, members of the faculty, staff and administration on why language sensitivity was so important to a student’s self-respect — and assisted students in getting school policy amended to specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.', 'By 2009, faculty members themselves began pushing for a broader solution to the identification issue, and Mr. Williams created a task force to look into how students could register a preferred first name without having to make a special request. The task force realized that the only way to guarantee a professor would properly refer to a student was to supply the student’s pronoun on class rosters and advisee lists. Then came the question of which gender-neutral pronoun to offer.', '""Students proposed ‘they/them’ pronouns, but the faculty vetoed the idea because they said it is grammatically incorrect,"" Mr. Williams recalled. ""They said, ‘You don’t put a plural pronoun with a single individual.’"" A second option, also being used in various trans communities, was ""ze"" (pronounced ZEE), a riff on the German pronoun ""sie,"" with ""hir"" replacing ""his/her.""', 'Bowing to the faculty, the task force selected ""ze"" and revised its information system, becoming the first school in the nation at which students could select their pronoun. They could also leave the field blank, or opt for ""name only,"" indicating a preference for being referred to by name instead of by pronoun.', 'The change fueled gender-awareness campaigns by students all over the country. So many administrators were receiving requests that, in 2012, the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers convened a task force to draft a list of best practices for handling transgender student records.', 'So far, about 100 schools now allow students, and sometimes employees, to indicate a moniker other than their legal first name, according to the Consortium of Higher Education L.G.B.T Resource Professionals, and hundreds more have contacted Vermont on how to implement the pronoun choice.', 'In September, the university’s pronoun options were expanded yet again to include ""they,"" as grammarians have reminded naysayers that the English language is constantly evolving. Since 2009, 1,891 University of Vermont students have specified a preferred pronoun, with 14 opting for ""ze,"" 10 for ""they"" and another 228 for name only.', 'On campuses across the country gender-conscious students have adopted the earnest, P.C. practice of starting social interactions by introducing themselves by name and ""P.G.P.,"" or preferred gender pronoun. (The most semantically obsessed still object to the word ""preferred."")', 'Robyn Ochs, an educator who helped found an early L.G.B.T. faculty and staff group at Harvard, believes that Vermont’s changes are nothing less than lifesaving.', '""Some people try to reduce this whole topic to kids trying to be cool or they’re just acting out or whatever, just trying to be different or new,"" said Ms. Ochs, who has visited some 500 campuses to speak on L.G.B.T. issues, and often facilitates a discussion she calls ""Beyond Binaries."" ""But there have always been people who have felt profoundly uncomfortable in their assigned gender roles,"" she said. ""Anything we can do to make them safer, or make them feel recognized, heard, seen, understood, we should do. To validate their identity and experience could, in fact, save their life.""', 'How does one explain to family members what it means to be neither male nor female? Once, at age 15, in conversation with an aunt at the kitchen table, Gieselman tried unsuccessfully to diagram the concepts of gender and sex on a napkin, with gender referring to the attitudes and behaviors a society associates with a person’s biological sex, and sex referring to a person’s biological status (not to be confused with sexual orientation, one’s romantic interests). ""I don’t even know what it was I was trying to show,"" Gieselman, an eighth-generation Vermonter, recounted with a laugh. Gieselman’s grandmother, too, had a few questions about the napkin. ""They were very confused,"" Gieselman said, ""and still are.""', 'Sara Miller, Gieselman’s mother, said that when her teenager first came out to her and offered to provide a pronoun chart for reference, she scoffed.', '""At the time, it irritated me to no end,"" said Ms. Miller, a social worker. ""I was like, ‘Really? This is what our struggle is going to be about? Pronouns?’""', 'But Ms. Miller has learned to accept the person her former little girl has become. ""It’s grown out of the process of really seeing how Rocko has grown as an individual and an adult, seeing how Rocko is their own person, and not a child,"" Ms. Miller said. ""This is how they presents themself to new friends and colleagues and employers and students. That group knows Rocko only that way.""', 'Although Ms. Miller tries her best to always use ""they/them"" pronouns, she often slips up, but Gieselman isn’t bothered. ""Rocko and I have an understanding. She knows I try,"" said Ms. Miller, slipping up again.', 'At last summer’s orientation for new faculty members, Ms. Brauer handed out pocket-size pronoun charts created by the L.G.B.T. Resource Center at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. She also gave out her cellphone number and words of support: ""If you’re struggling with it, give me a call any time and I’ll walk you through it, and give you time to practice, and walk you through any questions you might have.""', 'Use of ""they/them"" is so widely accepted in the politically correct enclave that is Burlington that a colleague at Feldman’s Bagels, where Gieselman works part time, recently asked if it was O.K. to correct a customer who uses the wrong pronoun because she knew Gieselman wouldn’t.', '""I know if something might be bothering them, they wouldn’t necessarily say something about it,"" said Alexa Ciecierski, a morning-shift co-worker.', 'At the apartment that afternoon, Gieselman talked excitedly about finally receiving documentation of a legal name change, which arrived in the mail that afternoon, and showed off several gig posters brought home by a roommate, who manages local bands. On the coffee table, a collection of Angel Cards filled a small bowl, each billet offering a single word like ""discernment"" or ""balance"" or ""integrity,"" meant to be chosen and read for a daily dose of inspiration.', '""Do you want to pick one?"" Gieselman asked me.

It sits in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than Earth and completing an orbit once every 310 Earth-years. Recent observation by the Hubble Space Telescope, however, has revealed that Makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon.', 'Finding a Dark Moon', 'Until this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake’s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake’s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake’s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The ""dark moon hypothesis"" offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. ""Imagine that the dark material isn’t on Makemake’s surface... it’s in orbit!"" image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. ""If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!""', 'Makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake’s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called MK2, was very good at remaining hidden.', 'MK2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than Makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to Earth, so we don’t see it circling Makemake, only oscillating back and forth. Looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. If you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in Parker’s words, ""not actually that faint""), but it was easy to miss before.', 'Part of a team from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Parker was the first to notice Makemake’s moon in data from the Hubble Space Telescope. At first, he', 'thought someone else must have already seen it. Just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader Marc Buie, ""Has anyone seen the moon in the Makemake data?"" When Buie replied, ""There’s a moon in the Makemake data?"" they knew they’d made a major discovery.', 'The Moon in the Data', 'It is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. More observations of MK2 from Hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. If MK2’s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in Makemake’s gravity as it floated by. Many smaller Kuiper Belt Objects have dark surfaces like MK2. This is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover Makemake) in place.', 'However, MK2’s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off Makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from Makemake’s past atmosphere. If MK2’s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between Makemake and another Kuiper Belt Object. If MK2 was created by an enormous crash between two Kuiper Belt Objects, according to the paper, ""The apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds."" If all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that Kuiper Belt Objects are often subjected to huge impacts.', 'The New, Improved Makemake System', 'While MK2 does create questions about the Makemake system and the Kuiper Belt, it will also provide answers. According to Parker, ""The discovery of this moon has given us an', 'opportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion."" ', 'Makemake is sometimes referred to as ""Pluto’s little sister"" because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees Fahrenheit. The discovery that Makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to Pluto. When Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about Pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. ""That\'s the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable,"" Parker said: MK2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet Makemake.', 'Looking at how MK2 orbits Makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system’s mass and probe its inner composition. As Caltech’s Mike Brown, a member of the team that discovered Makemake in 2005, said, ""The wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there. But we still have so few objects that each one adds a critical part of the story."" Small worlds like Makemake display a variety of internal compositions: they can contain rock and water ice, as well as other, more ""exotic"" ices and compounds. Since MK2 will allow scientists to tell Makemake’s density and thus the densities of the materials it’s made of, it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planets.', 'The James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018, will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis. Even before then, though, information about Makemake and its moon will continue to accumulate from new Hubble observations, teaching us about the outskirts of our solar system. ""This new discovery opens a new chapter in comparative planetology in the outer solar system,"" Buie said, and it will add to our understanding of the many worlds around us.']","""Pluto’s Little Sister"" Makemake Has Something Even Pluto Doesn’t",‘Pluto’s Little Sister’ Makemake has grown up.,,"['http://space.washyourbrain.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Makemake-805x589.jpg', 'http://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Obama-205x155.jpg', 'http://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/makemake_nasa_big.jpg', 'http://secondnexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/makemake_nasa_big.jpg', 'http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-q1u5wX8AfxWXr.gif', 'http://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/o-ROUNDWORM-facebook-205x155.jpg']",http://secondnexus.com/technology-and-innovation/makemakes-moon/,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': 'It has a moon. #StopClickBait', 'spoilerPublisher': 'Stop Clickbait - Science'}",['a charcoal-black moon'],"[[[2, 762], [2, 783]]]",['phrase']

Except for one particular style.', 'Ask your barber to scissor-cut the top of your head to about an inch and a half, adding a bit of texture to the ends with a razor. Around the sides and back, have him use a clipper to taper the length down to about a quarter inch, or an eighth if you feel like going really short.', 'This gives the face a squared look, where the sides are blended straight up and the top is slicked back with no visible part.', 'The heavy-on-top style is juxtaposed with a side of cool, with facial hair and cool specs.', 'You could achieve a formal look by slicking the full part of your hair with a hairdryer and a Denman brush for volume. Spritz some hairspray to firm it up.', 'Asymmetrical faux hawks give the appearance of playfulness. Get some gel and gather your hair up to one side with your fingers. Beau-haute!', 'Wavy hair? No problem. The clean and classy look works very well here too!', ""Pop culture and the media has a huge influence on how men sport their hair, so it's no surprise men emulate the hairstyles of their favorite musicians and celebrities to reflect the times. They even find inspiration from past trends, making everything old, new again. TV shows like Mad Men brought back the Don Draper cut, with tightened sides and a sharp part on the left side of the head that was typical among business professionals in the late 60s.With a population of roughly 318 million people here in the U.S., there is a huge range of styles and opinions when it comes to haircuts. But which is the cut that gets requested the most? GQ recently asked 500 barbers and stylists across our nation for the top three most requested haircuts. Their expectations about haircut preferences varying by region were...cut short. Before revealing the most requested haircut, here's a look at what's not on the top of everyone's list. Perhaps the mullet dominates in Kentucky or Oklahoma. Popularized by musicians like Rod Stewart and David Bowie (RIP), the mullet was predominant as far back as the early 70s. Some guys prefer to stay stuck in the era of disco. Still, it is not a popular haircut. No judgment here. You do your 'do the way you do!Perhaps the buzzcut is favored more in Iowa.Sadly, the buzzcut lacks the length of hair enough to be sweeping the nation. Maybe the Southwest prefers the Caesar's cut.None of these styles were in hot demand. But when all the data was compiled, there was one haircut that was consistently favored among men from Schenectady to Cincinnati, Portland to Nashville, Juneau to NYC, and every city in between. So which cut made the cut? There's no official name for the style, but it's basically the 'undercut,' long on top and short on the sides. The clean-cut style of a longer crown with a clipper cut fade on the sides won out as the preferred cut of choice. The prime example of the desired haircut is sported here by one of the most desirable men in Hollywood: Ryan Reynolds.The style is easily adaptable for both casual and formal occasions. This haircut works with most types of hair, including thick, wavy and curly hair. Want the same haircut? GQ shares how to ask your barber for the popular cut:The popular style is also easy to maintain, and there are plenty of options to play with.The word is out. This is the nation's popular haircut for now. But how long can it last? Will barbers be forever shearing this time-transcending method of the undercut, or will the style last as briefly as a cheap bottle of Dep gel? Time will tell, but since it's summer, it's gotta feel wonderful to clipper-cut the sides of your head. Your head will feel cool in the summer heat, and you'll be looking even cooler!

Ask any true Roman about it and you\'ll be met with a befuddled ""who is-a Alfredo?"" That\'s because, fellow Americans, Roman children didn\'t grow up scarfing down plates of this creamy comfort food like we did here. (Then again, Olive Garden has yet to hit Mediterranean shores.) Alfredo, after all, isn\'t found alongside carbonara and amatriciana in the pantheon of celebrated local dishes—not because it isn\'t Roman, but because it never spread throughout the city. Its origins lay in a single, no-name trattoria on a side street near the Trevi Fountain. In the early 1900s, the eponymous Alfredo di Lielo needed a calorific meal to feed his pregnant wife. So he combined butter and cheese and melted it over fettuccine noodles. Sated, his wife insisted he add it to his menu.', ""But it remained a strictly of-the-house specialty. Despite the acclaim (rumors swirl that Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks ate it on their Roman holiday in 1927), other trattorias likely rejected it due to inauthenticity. Alfredo used parmigiano for the cheese (a bold move in Pecorino Romano country) and butter, which was pretty much as foreign an ingredient to Italians at the time as milk was to the Japanese. But it did take off stateside thanks to a Pennsylvania noodle company: Pennsylvania Dutch marketed a creamy sauce called Alfredo after influential New York restaurateur George Renart raved about the dish in the Saturday Evening Post when he returned from a trip to Rome. The version we eat now—loaded with cream, often with chicken—is a bastardization of what Alfredo cooked up a century ago. And it's definitely not what you would find in Rome now, even if those trattorias from Testaccio to Prati had Alfredo on the menu (which they don't)."", 'Should we just quit the search and make do with carbonara instead? Local food expert Elizabeth Minchilli says no way. ""I always encourage travelers to seek out Alfredo in Rome,"" she says. ""You just need to know where to go."" That would be Trattoria della Scrofa, between Piazza Navona and the Trevi Fountain, a 103-year-old restaurant that Alfredo started after his first spot was flattened to make space for a shopping center. What you’ll get is a heaping plate of pasta prepped as Alfredo did it all those years ago: hot noodles, on a hot plate, mixed with (lots of) softened butter and (lots of) grated parmigiano right at your table.

In fact, his mere presence is enough to get most people excited about a movie, but did you know he was actually in one of the biggest flops of 2015? In fact, the movie made so little that almost no one even knows the film exists. Click over to the next page for the full story. As of this writing, The Shawshank Redemption is sitting atop the IMDB rankings of the most popular movies of all-time. The film is truly beloved today. However, that wasn’t always the case. While the film was critically praised upon its release, it was a commercial failure. Nobody saw it in the theaters, and most fans found it on home video or cable later. Morgan Freeman thinks that a large part of the reason the movie did so badly at first is because the title is awful.Appearing on Late Night With Seth Meyers , Morgan Freeman says he knew thatwas a great film as soon as he read the script, and that he was willing to play any role just to be in it, but if there was one thing he could have changed about it, it was the title page.While the original title of Stephen King’s novelladoesn’t do any better job telling you anything about what the movie actually is, Morgan Freeman has a point that at least that version has the name of a famous movie actress included, which is something people will recognize. Shawshank, the name of the prison where the film takes place, is a meaningless word by itself. Morgan Freeman jokes in the interview that many people would mispronounce the word, even while telling him how much they loved the movie.Hearing that the reason the title was shortened was so that it could fit on theater marquees is almost quaint. Today, few theaters still have marquees that you can see without standing in front of the ticket window, and the amount of space given to each title is such that even titles much shorter thanend up getting cut off. Morgan Freeman makes a good point, that by doing the title his way, the part that you see has Rita Hayworth’s name, which is something, although it’s possible the studio was afraid people would think the theater was showing old movies.While we’ll never know if the title change would have meant earlier financial success for The Shawshank Redemption we do know that the title they chose didn’t help. In the long run, however, fans find great movies and they eventually did find, making it one of the most popular films ever made.

That even includes nations such as China, now the world’s largest carbon emitter.', 'How did the environmental groups come up with such exact figures? The first scientific attempt to calculate each country’s ""fair share"" factored in historical emissions, its wealth, and its current population.', 'That means poor, populous, undeveloped countries would be the beneficiaries of funds from rich, developed nations to cut their emissions and help produce access to energy for the 2 billion people living largely off the grid.', '""We call this a part of the climate debt owed to us, and it is needed if we are to confront climate change while still responding to the needs of people,"" Lidy Nacpil, director at Jubilee South Asia Pacific Movement on Debt and Development, said in a statement. ""It’s not just a question of being fair. It’s about being realistic. To be realistic means if we want a hope of stopping climate change, these transfers have to happen. These deep cuts have to happen. That’s the realistic demand from people facing the full brutal force of climate change.""', 'The tool’s calculations are based on the latest International Panel on Climate Change report, which puts precise figures on emission cuts and money amounts needed to hold an increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2025.', 'Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at Stockholm Environment Institute, said that IPCC’s numbers show that temperature increases greater than 2 degrees could have irreversible effects on the world’s climate.', '""Based on those limits on climate pollution for the whole world, it is striking just how quickly emissions need to come down, across the world. It may be hard to do, but it’s dramatically easier than surviving 2, 3, 4 degrees of warming,"" Kartha said.', 'Kartha added that the online calculator shows not just what the whole world has to do to mitigate climate change but also helps answer the fundamental question in U.N. climate talks of what each country should do.', 'But how do we know all those billions transferred among nations would be put to good use and not squandered?', 'Alex Rafalowicz, a fellow at the Washington-based Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said the creation of a transparent U.N.

This is that pie come back with secrets and scars and stories to tell. It tastes familiar, like sugar pumpkins smoothed out with dairy and set with eggs, but it’s more complex and delicious than ever.', ""Behold Sister Pie's delicious tahini-cardamom squash pie in all its glory. Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg"", 'The recipe (see below) comes from Lisa Ludwinski of Sister Pie in Detroit. She doesn’t fear this year’s looming canned pumpkin shortage because she makes the filling from a bunch of different winter squash, split and roasted in her bakery’s kitchen. Between September and November, the mix changes depending on what’s good, from delicata and butternut to buttercup and hubbard.', 'A little cream infused with floral cardamom pods loosens up the mixture, which Ludwinski pours over an almost jammy spread of cream cheese that’s been blitzed with toasted walnuts and tahini, the peanut-butter-like paste made from sesame seeds. That thin layer of soft, pleasingly salty tahini-walnut spread is what makes this pie sing.', 'Lisa Ludwinski runs a team of 12 at Sister Pie, which in addition to pies also sells cookies, shortbread, and savory dishes like salads. Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg', '""There’s a large Middle Eastern population in Detroit, and I’ve been really influenced by the brightness of Middle Eastern flavors,"" Ludwinski said over the phone. ""Also I have a total obsessive love for tahini.""', 'One of Michigan native Ludwinski’s earliest memories is of her parents taking her to a Cinnabon and seeing the magic behind the scenes. ""I will always remember watching people put the cinnamon into the dough, the slicing and the icing,"" Ludwinski says. It’s no coincidence that at Sister Pie she designed an open kitchen, too. Anyone walking in for a cup of coffee and some shortbread can see bakers scooping cookies, sealing hand pies with a fork, or rolling out dough by hand.', ""Sister Pie's counter is filled with other goodies, such as these freshly baked peanut butter cookies (spiked with paprika). Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg"", 'Ludwinski moved to New York in 2006 to pursue a career in theater, but she was sidetracked by the food scene. At Momofuku\'s Milk Bar, where she worked for Christina Tosi, she developed a taste for low-moisture, high-fat Plugra butter, which Ludwinski now uses for all her doughs. ""You’ve got to use it every time,"" she says, ""because the flavor is so different, and so clear."" She picked up the habit of adding a splash of apple cider vinegar to the dough at Four & Twenty Blackbirds pie shop in Gowanus, Brooklyn, where Ludwinski spent a year making pies. Ludwinski says this gives the crust a bit of extra flake and a mild tang.', 'This Thanksgiving will mark the shop’s first holiday since its opening back in April in Detroit\'s West Village, and Ludwinski is planning to stay open until noon to sell locals fresh pies like sweet potato-marshmallow, brandy-pecan, and salted maple pumpkin. ""It just seems kind of silly for a pie shop to be closed on Thanksgiving,"" she says.', 'Lisa Ludwinski of Sister Pie in Detroit.

Once it's cooled, scoop out the flesh and add to a food processor with the pumpkin purée and mix until smooth.

Roll out, keeping it moving with your hands and throwing on more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have a disk of even thickness that’s about 12 inches in diameter. Invert your pie tin or dish onto the circle, and cut a circle that is about 1 to 2 \xadinches larger than the tin. Place the folded dough into the pie tin and gently press it in. Roll up the extra dough hanging over the edge toward the center of the pie, creating a ring of dough, then crimp it all around. Put the crust in the freezer for at least 15 minutes.', '6. Blind bake the pie crust so that it holds its shape and is cooked through in the finished pie: P\u200breheat the oven to 425 degrees with a rack on the lowest level. Remove the pie crust from the freezer and place a square of aluminum foil over it. Fill with dried beans and place on baking sheet. Bake in oven for 15 minutes. Cool for 6 minutes, then carefully remove foil and beans. Turn heat down to 325 degrees.', 'Travel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter.', '7. Fill and finish the pie: Brush the crimped edges of pie crust with a little bit of egg wash, then spoon all of the tahini\xad-walnut paste onto the bottom of the crust and spread evenly (you can use your fingers to gently press it down). Pour the squash filling over the paste and carefully transfer back to oven. Bake pie for 40 minutes to 1 hour, until the edges are puffed up and the center is only slightly jiggly, then remove from oven and sprinkle lightly with sesame seeds. The pie should rest for at least 2 hours before slicing, and can also chill for a couple of hours in the fridge after it’s cooled if you like to serve it cold.', 'Tejal Rao is the New York food critic for Bloomberg.

The country is Samsung's home turf."", '(Scurzuzu / Flickr)', 'Apple is massively known as one of the top purveyors of new innovations and advancements in technology. With the new patent filed by Apple recently, no one would not think what the Cupertino-giant is preparing in the pipeline.', 'Apple has filed lately a patent application with code US 20160264304 A1 for a paper bag. According to a report by The Telegraph, the patent is described as ""a bag container formed of white solid bleached sulfate paper with at least 60% post-consumer content.""', 'The report stressed that this quirky innovation by Apple has already been in use around its stores across the globe and not too many noticed it until the patent came out. Apart from the patent being filed by Apple, the new paper bag innovation caught the attention of the tech community because of its support to environmental preservation.', 'Accordingly, this paper bag is made of 60% recycled materials. As Apple\'s application stated, ""The bag may be formed entirely of paper with the potential exception of adhesives for fixing together portions of the bag. This can help to reduce any environmental impact from production, use, and disposal of the bag.""', 'It furthered that the bag container material can be suitably used for many times even after slight tearing. However, like the wireless earbuds Apple produced for the iPhone 7, the paper bag technology has drawn flak and sarcasm from netizens.', 'Meanwhile, the company has slowly been introducing efforts to improve current state of the environment. Earlier this year, Apple made public a robot called Liam to partake in recycling old iPhone units. In 2015, the company said almost 100% of its energy usage came from renewable sources.']",Apple Files New Patent And You Won’t Believe What It Is For : Tech :

I did an outline, about 100 pages long, and kind of just dumped everything from the book into it. I said, okay let’s go get the rights, and then they came back to us and said that they had made a mistake. The rights were not available.

And the dialogue, by which I mean the characters, just the way they expressed themselves was interesting. It was a simple, to the point way of saying things without saying everything.', 'The book is very interior. It takes place in Mickey’s head, which was difficult to do in a film. You have to show that, you can’t tell it. That was a challenge. Mickey’s state of mind and his anxiety in hanging on to this woman that he feels lucky to be with. He feels that if I lose this woman then I’ll never get anybody else like that. I think there’s a sentence that says he realized that would be the last woman he would ever get without paying for it.

You go through the proper channels because you don’t want to burden anybody with ""do me a favor."" That’s a drag.

I hadn’t gotten Phil to officially commit yet so I said here’s the script, I’d love you to play this part and I hope to get Phil. She was thrilled. I sent it to Richard Jenkins who is represented by my agent. About 45 minutes later, he called and said he was in. And then John Turturro read it and called up and said he was busy doing a movie but that he wanted to do it too. I was just floored.', 'There’s a scene where Christina is up on a balcony and the men are below in the street looking up at her. She slowly walks inside and that quiet moment really illuminated how much power her character has in this film.', 'She condoned this guy being beaten to death because he took advantage of her. What I wanted to convey was that this is a woman who knows her currency. All these guys know their weight in the world -- whether it’s slapping somebody around or using the way you look to get what you want. She knows this guy wants to get in her pants and she wants to find something out. She realized in that scene in the field that the way to do that is to let him do what he wants. But then he doesn’t give her what she wants. And in the end she watches him getting beaten in the street and she just walks away, letting it happen. If she had said stop, they would have stopped.', 'You mentioned earlier that making this movie 10 years ago would have been very different.

You get to a point where you’re young and you’re an actor and everything is always about ""if I could just get this,"" ""if I could only get that."" And then you start to realize this is my place in the food chain. This is what I do well. I don’t do everything well. I can’t play everything. I’m not a movie star. I don’t want to be a movie star. Your aspirations become more your own. And then it occurs to you to want to put your own foot forward creatively. You watch other people do their thing and you think, ""I could do this. I can try at this.""', 'You also realize that there are sophisticated degrees of performing. There’s actor A, B, C and then there’s Phil Hoffman.

And only 22 percent of infants are exclusively breastfed to 6 months, which the WHO recommends due to breastmilk’s unparalleled nutritional properties. Those deficiencies are largely due to a lack of institutional support, as less than half of moms receive any paid time off after childbirth, limiting their ability to breastfeed.', 'The report also found that at least 40 percent of parents introduce solid foods and sugary drinks to their children too early, and one in four toddlers don’t receive enough iron in their diet.', 'That doesn’t even begin to address all the economic factors at play.', '""Half of the babies born in this country are participating in Women, Infants and Children program here in the United States,"" Lucy Sullivan, the executive director of 1,000 Days, said on Capitol Hill Wednesday, referring to the program commonly known as WIC.', '""That’s a reminder that the problems we are dealing with is not a small population over here somewhere in the U.S. that maybe looks like the population of a developing country,"" she added.

Without enough iron or specific vitamins, a child’s brain may never form all its potential synapses. They can also be physically weaker, and the combination can set the child up to be less competitive in the workforce later in life and raise their health care costs.', 'Experts also worry that the nutritional diets of infants today mimic those of a growing number of overweight and obese American adults, setting them up for a lifetime unhealthy food choices and health problems.', 'The face of hunger and malnutrition looks like America.

93052b78-1a46-4021-b7e8-fd13f3ec65fc,810282611591483393,the future of fast food has arrived and it's a one-of-a-kind experience,Twitter,"[""We've seen the future of fast food and it's full of secretive cooking, utensils popping out of walls and a whole lot of quinoa."", 'Eatsa, an innovative, vegetarian automated restaurant chain, which just opened its first East Coast location (in New York) on Wednesday, is looking to revolutionize the food industry by offering customers a one-of-a-kind food experience.', 'The tech-savvy restaurant aims to offer fresh, affordable food fast, but with an unconventional twist: It replaces the presence of good old-fashioned cashiers and waiters with... robots.', 'Instead of the usual face-to-face ordering and pickup, customers at Eatsa simply order their food by means of in-store kiosks, online or through an app on their phones. The food then mysteriously appears on location in a glass ""cubby"" displaying the customer\'s name, and they\'re free to chow down. This means no lines, no counter and no human conversation, because what could be worse? ', 'The concept, while intriguing, also sounds a bit terrifying. So with a mind full of skepticism Mashable headed down to the newly opened Midtown Manhattan location to see what all the hype is about.', 'While one might assume a cashier-free environment would be completely devoid of human interaction, that was far from the case. Though I initially feared the establishment would have a lifeless art gallery-esque vibe, the music was pumping, the customers were chatting and upon walking into the sleek restaurant I was instantly greeted by a friendly Eatsa ""mascot.""', 'Much like Apple Geniuses, Eatsa has several employees stationed on the floor to offer customer assistance and ensure you\'re not entirely left alone. ""There are always people on the floor — our mascots, we call them — and we’re out here helping the guests and getting them through the process,"" explained Scott Bruggman, an Eatsa corporate trainer who began as an R&D chef creating bowls.', 'To the right of the wood-floored room stood a row of electronic ordering kiosks, and to the left, the restaurant had several tables for those who wanted to engage in a slightly more familiar dining experience. This all felt relatively tame, but the back of the restaurant held the real magic: a wall made entirely of electronic, microwave-looking cubbies that would reveal your mysteriously prepared meal. Zap. ', ""Since there was no one to take my order, I made my way to the kiosk to choose from the customizable bowls, bites and beverages on Eatsa's strictly vegetarian menu. Once I put in my request for a Hummus & Falafel Bowl, I walked toward the illuminated cubbies and within minutes my name was displayed on the screen above them, alerting me that my order was up. This was the moment of truth."", 'Right before your food arrives in your cubby, Eatsa fills you with intrigue. Your cubby turns completely dark to prevent you from seeing the secrets of the kitchen and tantalizingly displays the words, ""It\'s coming."" After you\'re given a playful peek at your meal, the cubby gives you the literal green light and you can receive your meal by tapping the glass twice.', 'TBH, it felt like something straight out of The Jetsons.', 'The process was quick, simple and the food was fresh, as promised.', ""Though I was satisfied with the space-age experience, I couldn't stop wondering what the hell was going on behind that wall of mystery. I turned to Dean Marsh, director of market operations for the East Coast for some answers, but was kindly shut down. Marsh adamantly explained that much like the secrecy of costumed characters at Disney World, the public is not supposed to know what truly goes on in the depths of the Eatsa kitchen."", 'Very ominous.', 'Despite the attempt to keep the tricks of the trade to themselves, many believe that several human chefs work alongside robots. ""The Eatsa bots are back there,"" Bruggman said. ""There’s a lot of different things going on and we use as much technology as we can to better enhance the experience.""', 'First-time customers and vegetarians Madee Bryke and her boyfriend Andrew Powell also had their theories. ""There are people back there; I know that,"" Bryke said. ""I think it’s fun that there’s robots, but there are definitely people still working.""', 'As of right now, Bruggman described the tech and human ratio as ""a real blend — that’s how we make it so fast and so quick.""', 'With the rise of technology creating strong barriers against personal interaction, one of the major concerns the innovative restaurant raises is that the lack of human interaction may come across as too impersonal.', 'While this may seen like a dream for introverts, surprisingly, the futuristic vibe only made things more fun. Millennials, such as Sabina M. who works a few blocks away and was eating there for the second day in a row, felt that if anything, the environment was encouraging people to be more social. ""Maybe it’s just because of the novelty,"" she said, ""but it seems like people are almost more social here cause everyone’s like woah this is crazy. So it’s kind of getting people to talk to one another."" ', 'Bryke and Powell, also millennials, agreed. ""I definitely think it almost opens it up to more talk, it seems like they have a community,"" Bryke said.', 'Her boyfriend, Powell, said that when you think about it, the automated restaurant is not much different from other forms of take-out. ""People already order Seamless and then go pick it up from a delivery guy so how is this much different? It’s almost like a robot’s making it anyways.""', 'To get a sense of how the older demographic was feeling about the revolutionary service, Gen X-er and first-time customer, Maarten Nederlof gave Mashable his two-cents. ""We’re a little older and have been watching the whole decline in social interaction,"" he said. ""So this is a walk on the non-interacting side for us, but I think for younger people who have no social interaction, coming here is a great avoidance scheme.""', 'Nederlof explained that there are still tables, so people getting food can sit down inside and socialize. Therefore it\'s the best of both worlds. ""Are you really missing out on that much?"" he questioned. ', 'Marsh, director of market operations for Easta, feels the restaurant\'s technology is actually giving people more time to engage in social interaction. ""Where you may spend 15 to 20 minutes at any of our competitors getting in and out with the regular fast food concept, for us it\'s three to four minutes. We feel that extra time gives you even more time interact with people,"" he said. ', ""Though the Manhattan Eatsa has only been open for a few days, the restaurant's unique style is receiving a lot of love (just like like the five other locations in California and D.C.)"", '""Every restaurant competitor on the street has been in at least two times and we’ve only been open for two days. We’ve gotten a lot of interest from the big boys: the McDonalds and Starbucks of the world,"" he said.', ""What's next? Perhaps an automated restaurant to please all the meat-eaters out there.""]","Waiter-less, cashier-less restaurant is the stuff of the future","We've seen the future of fast food and it's full of secretive cooking, utensils popping out of walls and a whole lot of quinoa.","new-york, conversations, food, restaurant, tech",,,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': None, 'spoilerPublisher': None}",['robots'],"[[[2, 179], [2, 185]]]",['phrase']

According to a recent study at the University of Chicago, sleep deprivation is also the cause of an increase in the appetite for salty and sweet treats. The results are quite substantial, going into the link between obesity and sleep deprivation.', 'Just by depriving oneself of sleep, one can experience an increase in appetite a lot like the one experienced after getting stoned. The results even suggest that it may be a reaction of the body that causes the hunger boost much like getting the munchies after a joint.', 'Conducting the study', 'The University of Chicago invited 14 men and women in their twenties to come and participate in two sessions at the clinical research centre there at the university. The researchers controlled the sleep patterns of the participants, meaning that sometimes they slept 7 hours and at other times their sleep was reduced down to only 4 hours and 11 minutes. The researchers also controlled how much food and what food was being served to the participants, serving them three meals a day at 9 am, 2 pm and 7 pm.', 'After the fourth night of each session, the participants were offered snacks from which to choose. They included the kind of snacks we like to indulge in when we are stoned, such as extremely sweet or salty food. They found that those that were sleep deprived were far less likely to resist the offer of snacks, and their urge to binge on them was highest in the afternoon right through to the early evening.', 'Sleep deprivation and obesity', 'It has long been believed that there is a link between sleep deprivation and obesity, and this study can confirm the very reason that they may be linked. Depriving the human body of sleep interfere’s with its production of hormones that control things like appetite and satiety.', 'The scientists conducting this study looked into the kind of hormones that were present in the blood during the study. They looked specifically at the hormones ghrelin and leptin. Ghrelin is the hormone that deals with appetite whereas leptin is the hormone that tells the brain when the body is full of food.', 'The endocannabinoid system', 'Finally, the scientists decided that they would delve a little further into the body’s craving for food and have a look at the endocannabinoid system, the same system that is excited and activated by using marijuana. Erin Hanlon, who lead the study, found that there was a certain endocannabinoid that was increased after sleep deprivation that could be the cause for the increase in appetite.', 'Endocannabinoid 2-AG is the chemical that increases the amount of pleasure you feel after you eat, and is an endocannabinoid that also increases after the use of marijuana. ""We know that marijuana activates the endocannabinoid system and causes people to overeat when they are not hungry, and they normally eat yummy sweet and fatty foods,"" Hanlon said.

Detached from her lethally curvaceous figure, the actress\' breathy contralto is no less seductive, but it also alights with tenderness and wonder as Samantha, both here on Earth and up there in the Cloud, voraciously devours literature, philosophy and human experience,"" wrote Variety critic Scott Foundas.', '""Johansson\'s work in the film is lovely, and the best thing about the way she plays the part is that there\'s nothing calculated or \'sexy\' about the way she approaches it. Removed from the undeniable sweater-girl appeal she packs when she\'s onscreen, forced to rely only on her voice, Johansson comes across as a warm, curious, vibrant personality.

8146b026-5683-42f3-9b0b-042c0f4a7ea9,664511746397315072,this u.s. city is welcoming veterans with an innovative new program,Twitter,"['Fred Johnson is effusive.', 'After a 29-year career in the Army, including three combat tours, he has moved on to a dream job as a fundraiser for a nonprofit -- in Louisville, Kentucky, a city he loves.', 'I can hear the excitement in his voice as he tells me I must visit Louisville.', '""You’ve gotta come, dude -- it’s awesome,"" Johnson told me. ""This is an up-and-coming town.""', 'But Johnson might not have been able to find the job and community of his dreams were it not for Where Opportunity Knox, an innovative new veterans re-integration program.', 'Last year, Johnson was one of more than 100,000 soldiers leaving active duty Army service. Every single one of them passes through Fort Knox before re-entering the civilian world.', 'Those Army veterans are looking for jobs and communities where they can begin a new life as civilians. The greater Louisville, Kentucky, area where Fort Knox is located has a vibrant cultural scene and growing economy in need of capable workers and young families.', 'Visions of America/Getty Images The Louisville, Kentucky, skyline.', 'Until recently, however, there was no coordinated effort to connect the soon-to-be civilians in Fort Knox with job opportunities and communal life in Louisville.', 'So in September 2014, three regional chambers of commerce launched Where Opportunity Knox to try to change that.', 'The program has the enthusiastic backing of the U.S. Army, but it does not take a dime from the government. It relies exclusively on funding from philanthropic foundations. And it has already racked up some impressive numbers.', 'Where Opportunity Knox claims credit for connecting 1,500 veterans to jobs in the region already. And it has the goal of navigating 10,000 veterans to jobs in the greater Louisville area by 2017.', 'Filling A Void', 'The transition to civilian life for soldiers being processed at Fort Knox has two stages, according to retired Col. Walter Herd, the director of the Army’s Transition Assistance Program: preparation for a career outside the Army and connection to opportunities in the civilian world.', 'The Army spends two weeks on the first part, Herd said, helping soldiers with ""everything from their own personal and psychological understanding, to their budgetary needs, culminating with a résumé and job preparation.""', ""Connecting those soldiers to a career and community is how Where Opportunity Knox complements the Army’s work. Representatives of the group are often on premises at training sessions in Fort Knox to assess soldiers' needs and answer questions. They advertise their availability to talk by email or phone on RallyPoint, an internal military professional networking site."", 'Where Opportunity Knox emphasizes that it is not a job placement program. It just gives veterans the personal support, insight and connections to the employer community that they are less likely to find on, say, Monster.com.', 'In addition to a team of several permanent staff members, Where Opportunity Knox uses a proverbial army of ""regional veteran connectors"" -- 35 trained volunteers -- to help veterans identify job opportunities in the region, and a local community to live in that meets their needs.

The survey, released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University, didn\'t elaborate on what ""moral"" encompasses.', 'That could help the Democratic candidate by making her policy positions appear stronger. According to new research, a perception of morality strengthens an argument, giving it more sway than opinions based on tradition or practicality.', ""In the study, published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Ohio State University doctoral student Andrew Luttrell and his team hypothesized that the people or causes we most admire share a common trait: They're connected to our sense of morality, a psychological shield against outside attacks. As in: Oh, you disagree with me? Well, I won’t be swayed because I’m standing up for what’s right."", 'The researchers wanted to see if a person’s opinion grew stronger or was more likely to withstand challenges if their viewpoint was declared to be ""moral."" So, they set up a series of experiments with three groups of roughly 100 participants.', '[How Democratic and Republican morals compare to the rest of the world]', 'Luttrell and his colleagues gave the first group, all college students, information about a new senior exam policy and asked them to write down their thoughts. Next, the participants, separated by partitions, received printed ""feedback"" on their opinions. Some were told their ideas on the phony exam policy reflected ""tradition."" Others heard their ideas projected ""morality.""', 'Like this:', '""While your thoughts were similar to other students\' on a variety of dimensions, you seem to have based your thoughts about senior comprehensive exams on morality/tradition more than the average student.""', 'Simply telling someone their attitude was moral, Luttrull found, gave it more power. Compared to those in the ""tradition"" group, the participants who heard their thoughts reflected morality were more likely to say they’d sign a petition to support the bogus policy, put their name on a list of students who support the policy and vote in favor of the policy. They marked their interest in these actions on a scale of one to nine:', 'In the next two experiments — one with college students and one with a broader sample of adults — researchers asked participants to perform a similar task, this time focused on recycling.', 'The group’s consensus: Recycling is generally a good thing. After respondents wrote down their individual thoughts and took the same nine-point tests, they received feedback on their recycling beliefs. Some heard their views were ""practical."" Others heard ""moral.""', 'Then the researchers tried to change everyone’s mind. They slipped respondents a note that said recycling puts more cars on the road and encourages pollution.', 'People\'s attitudes in the ""morality"" group and ""practicality"" group didn\'t significantly differ before they read the anti-recycling message. But afterward, a post-test revealed the ""moral"" respondents viewed recycling more favorably (7.56 on a nine-point scale) than the ""practical"" respondents (6.88).', '""Those led to believe that their recycling attitudes were grounded in morality were more resistant to the anti-recycling message than those led to believe that their attitudes were grounded in practicality,"" the authors wrote.', 'The takeaway, according to Luttrell: Framing a cause as ""moral"" is a smart tactic for politicians and advocates. Any issue, it appears, can be viewed through the morality lens, which is why we\'ll be probably fighting about politics forever.', '""Is moral a magic word?"" he said. ""In some ways, it might be. We grow up thinking morality is this thing that\'s untouchable.

By creating free online radio stations, the tech giant is hoping to better compete against Spotify and Pandora, which have gained huge followings with their free music streaming services, and convert some free Google listeners into paying customers."", ""Tuesday's premiere by Google coincides with recent tensions between streaming services and music artists.

But it served as a big reminder about the tensions between the music streaming services and musicians, many of whom are angry about what they describe as low royalty rates.', 'Google, with its new Internet radio, said it is paying the statutory rate to artists.

As competition heats up with Apple in the mix, Google will need a free service to pull in paid users. Google doesn’t disclose subscriber numbers. But it did say that it has doubled the number of paid listeners in the last year.', 'In comparison, Spotify recently revealed that it has 75 million users, 25 million of whom are paid subscribers.', 'Google’s free service will include two types of ads including a video pre-roll ad as well as banner ads. Marketers can buy ads as a part of the Google display and video networks.', ""Some of the nuts and bolts behind Google's free streaming comes from Google acquisition last year of Songza, a music streaming service that used humans to curate playlists.

According to the Rubicon Project While we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake Halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. According to the Holiday Consumer Pulse survey , millennials are one of the primary groups controlling holiday spending this year. The Rubicon survey reports that millennials are predicted to spend an average of $1,427 in 2016, up from the $1,072 they spent last year. This is based off 1,003 interviews Rubicon conducted in late August 2016.', 'Erin says she can see herself spending close to the millennial average by the time she’s completed her shopping. She shops for her immediate family, her fiancé, her fiancé’s parents and her two best friends.', '""For the parents, nana and brother, my fiancé and I usually split the cost which helps tremendously. Right now I have all the friend presents, my mom’s present and I know what I’m getting for everyone,"" says Erin. ""My fiancé and I are going to Hawaii on our honeymoon, so we’re getting each other an experience while we’re there, that’s the only one I’m really waiting on.""', 'Millennials aren’t the only ones controlling holiday shopping this year. Their spending still comes second to parents (though these two categories overlap). Parents plan to spend an average of more than $1,700 this holiday season. Not only is this about $300 more than they spent in 2015 (the average was $1,383 last year), but it’s also substantially more than the $903 non-parents plan to spend.', 'Parents are predicted to spend $495 per child this year, which is nearly $100 more than they spent last year. However, there is a discrepancy between how much each parent spends. Male parents plan to spend slightly more per child. The survey results for millennials and parents also revealed that more than half plan to buy a gift for themselves. (The men planning on buying gifts for themselves say they’d spend approximately $400, compared to the average of $242 women say they’ll spend on themselves.)', 'As for where the money is going, millennials are by far the most digitally enabled shoppers, which means it will be another big holiday season for online retailers.', '""Most of [my shopping] will be online,"" says Erin. ""It’s just easier that way. I can compare prices a little easier than in the stores, and I use cash back extensions on my browser which helps get some money back.""', 'Walmart and Amazon are still predicted to be in the top retail spots for 2016 holiday shopping, but millennials heavily favor Amazon. And l ike Erin, 84% of shoppers research their gift selections online before committing.', 'Overall, the average holiday shopper will spend $1,175 this year, up from last year’s average of $1,051. Of those surveyed, 44% plan to spend more this year than they did in 2015.', 'In addition, Cyber Monday sales might rival Black Friday sales this year. Of those surveyed, 42% will shop on Black Friday, but 47% will capitalize on Cyber Monday deals. Based on the behaviors of millennial and parent shoppers, it’s not surprising that Cyber Monday will be so big; 58% of millennials say they are more compelled by online advertising than television advertising, while 38% of parents make purchases online directly from their mobile device.', 'We’re not even into October yet, so there’s still plenty of time to start saving for your projected holiday expenses. And the sooner you start, the more you’ll be able to budget little by little, instead of incurring one huge financial hit in December. Even if you’re opposed to buying in October, you can start by browsing for sales, checking when prices on different items might drop, comparing reviews to find the right gifts, and of course, putting away whatever you can spare so you have a healthy holiday shopping stash.']",Here's How Much You're Going To Spend On The Holidays This Year,"You've been warned well in advance, so there's still time to start saving.",,"['http://archive.is/WnJQf/22b9cefe3fe89cc7c8240db655dedc8dfe41b6dc', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/fdad158358424e2ff6c46ef6c71bbb5801eb5eaa.png', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/995e2e660709ca5e6fd624d660dc5193bdd9cb73.jpg', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/eb043108ca91c5a4536fd5a68150d2fdc7f2663d', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/68cbf1693b6ec53fa1193fd698280e68284f61aa/scr.png', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/f6a84fa458ddad87af110efc46ae89506a781b10', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/3b1a47128943a59019f7d578a291e494abfc0357', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/b81644b1d6a60bc974c1ac619a46b86d2fe2b7c6', 'data:image/png;base64,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', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/aec4b70785df3507611485a163ef051c3339867f.gif', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/c60b43ab58afbdb4c63f1437eceec725e294c7f7', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/442104bfe49e442ecd0a2f5000f8cce1f92c66ee', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/67d1302b74917d5089d787969071a99e5c5c9677', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAgACAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAACAAIAAAIChFEAOw==', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/cf1d186cfd227b6a8536c557e37a0a67942e9537', 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/1eb3f483ae870ea426764717893161adde2d9220', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/997ac42cb03c6d2fde908e7d38f2ce919a3f000a.svg', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==', 'data:image/png;base64,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', 'http://archive.is/WnJQf/7ac0cdeeca1ec3d6195cef994c56793b01a6548e']",http://archive.is/WnJQf,"{'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': '$1,427.00', 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}","['$1,427']","[[[5, 641], [5, 647]]]",['phrase']

For some of you readers, Pokemon may have been around since before you were born, which makes me feel even older considering I played link-battles on the school bus with my friends.', ""With Nintendo's upcoming release of two new Pokemon titles, Pokemon Sun and Moon, I don't think they ever thought that their beloved games would wind up getting so complicated. But when you starting renaming one of the most famous characters in the franchise, it's easy to see why things are getting so complicated. With Nintendo's attempt to unify game releases in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan the games are going to be released in both traditional and simplified Chinese. This may not seem like a big deal, but until now differences in culture and dialect have spawned a variety of translations. This is going to change with Sun and Moon and as reported by Zheping Huang in Quartz, this is what we'll see:"", 'Now Nintendo wants to unify them: Pokémon in Greater China will be officially called 精靈寶可夢, or Jingling Baokemeng in Mandarin (Jingling means ""spirit"" or ""elf,"" and Baokemeng is a transliteration of Pokémon). Earlier in Hong Kong, it was 寵物小精靈 Pet Little Elves (or Spirits), while in Taiwan, it was 神奇寶貝, Magic Babies.', ""This probably makes sense if you live in any area with a singular dialect, but when you're trying to make one unified language version of a game to an area that has several unique dialects there are bound to be some twists."", ""Hong Kong is where one of these twists can be found - Hong Kong being where the common language has always been Cantonese, rather than Mandarin.

In the cases where prosecutors have won convictions, defendants have received sentences ranging from 2 to 45 years in prison. One case was dismissed after the victim decided not to pursue the case.', ""Rape kits include biological samples and physical evidence gathered from sexual assault victims that are later processed to see if they match a suspect's DNA. Testing results are uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS."", 'Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said there were some cases where suspects committed other crimes while rape kits that could have identified them sat untested.', '""Now that the testing of these kits is complete, we know that it\'s up to us to finish the job and to seek justice for these victims.

""Tonight, we tucked our kids in bed and my husband and I enjoyed a glass of wine on the deck. We were talking about how excited we were to attend an upcoming wedding in Kalamazoo (where we met and went to college) and discussing what would be the perfect gift for the newlyweds. So, I thought back to our wedding day (nearly 9 years ago) and tried to recall the gifts that had meant the most to me. The funny thing? The gift that meant the very most was still sitting in a closet... ... unopened. On our wedding day, my husband Brandon and I received a gift from my Great Aunt Alison. On the plain white box was a card that read, ""Do not open until your 1st disagreement."" Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years. There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up... but we never opened the box. I honestly think that we both avoided turning to the box, because it would have symbolized our failure. To us, it would have meant that we didn’t have what it takes to make our marriage work – and we’re both too stubborn and determined for that. So, it forced us to reassess situations. Was it really time to open the box? What if this isn’t our worst fight? What if there’s a worse one ahead of us and we don’t have our box?!? As my Great Uncle Bill would say, \'Nothing is ever so bad that it couldn’t get worse.\' All along, we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage – an age old trick – unbeknownst to us rookies. After all, my Great Aunt and Uncle had been married for nearly half a century. So, we thought the box would save ""us"" – and in a way it did. That box went beyond what I believe my Great Aunt had intended. It was by far the greatest wedding gift of all. For 9 years (and three moves) that box sat high on a shelf in various closets gathering dust, yet it somehow taught us about tolerance, understanding, compromise and patience. Our marriage strengthened as we became best friends, partners, and teammates. Today, we decided to open that box, because I finally had a realization. I realized that the tools for creating and maintaining a strong, healthy marriage were never within that box – they were within us."" # LoveWhatMatters Love What Matters Original Story Submitted by Kathy Gunn See More 14K 680 3.1K', 'Brandon and Kathy Gunn Kathy Gunn', 'Kathy Gunn', 'Brandon and Kathy Gunn Kathy Gunn', 'No offense to your Vitamix, but it\'s safe to say that this is the greatest wedding gift of all time.Although Kathy and Brandon Gunn have been married since Sept. 1, 2007, they still had one wedding that they hadn\'t opened – until this May. Kathy wrote a post explaining why they\'d waited to open the gift, which was from her great Aunt Alison and was attached to a note that read, ""Do not open until your first disagreement.""""Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years,"" she wrote in the post , which was shared by the page Love What Matters on August 29. ""There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up ... but we never opened the box.""Kathy admits that they\'d avoided opening the box after all these years because they thought it would have symbolized a failure. ""To us, it would have meant that we didn\'t have what it takes to make our marriage work – and we\'re both to stubborn and determined for that,"" she wrote. ""So it forced us to reassess situations. Was it really time to open the box? What if this isn\'t our worst fight? What if there\'s a worse one ahead of us and we don\'t have our box?!""In May, after almost a decade and three moves, they finally decided to open the box, and found two hand-written notes wrapped around some cash, as well as wine glasses and bath products. The note to Kathy told her to buy pizza (""or something you both like"") and prepare a bath, and the note to Brandon said, ""Go get flowers and a bottle of wine.""In the end, Kathy wrote that they had been enjoying this gift for almost a decade, even though the box – which she calls ""the greatest wedding gift of all"" – hadn\'t been opened.""I realized that the tools for creating a strong, healthy marriage were never within that box – they were within us.""In an interview with PEOPLE, Kathy opened up about how their story has inspired other couples.""My husband and I are in awe of how much attention this story has garnered,"" she says. ""I had only intended to give credit to my great aunt and share how important the box was for my husband and I – and the lessons that it had inadvertently taught us. Now that our story has gotten so much attention and has inspired others, it seems to be the gift that keeps on giving!""As for her wise great aunt, Kathy says, ""She is just tickled by how much attention this has gotten – how many people have shared that they wish they had an \'Aunt Alison\' and those that think her gift was absolutely genius. She didn\'t realize just how special the gift was to us until a number of years after our wedding when she found out that we hadn’t opened it yet.""Aunt Alison was surprised that we kept it for nine years, then the lessons it taught us – inadvertently – and now she’s even more surprised at the response our story has received.""And when it comes to their best advice to other couples when it comes to handling disagreements, she says, ""For the little things, learn how to disagree and move on. For the bigger things, learn how to get mad and get over it. Giving up was never an option in our situation because we never had the illusion that marriage was going to be easy. Building that strong foundation is hard work – but once it’s set, it will provide a lifetime of friendship, partnership and love.""']",Wedding Gift Opened After 9 Years At First Disagreement :

Do you want to tell which state Springfield is in?""', 'So by this point, with ""The Simpsons"" entering its 28th season and still officially maintaining the mystery, any clue as to where the real Springfield is could be noteworthy.', 'The Simpson family has resided in the American town of Springfield for nearly three decades. But despite millions of fellow Americans watching their lives every week, nobody has ever figured out where their ""Springfield"" actually is. The town name is extremely popular in this country and the family’s creator, Matt Groening, has never quite revealed its true location.', 'Groening has actually said in the past that the Springfield in the show was named after Springfield, Oregon, but didn’t go so far as to admit ""street names and locations"" were, as well.', 'In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece ""Matt Groening Reveals the Location of the Real Springfield."" Here’s part of the piece that gets into the Oregon connection:', 'OK, why do the Simpsons live in a town called Springfield? Isn’t that a little generic? Springfield was named after Springfield, Oregon. The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show ""Father Knows Best"" took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown. When I grew up, I realized it was just a fictitious name. I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, ""This will be cool; everyone will think it’s their Springfield."" And they do. You’ve never said it was named after Springfield, Oregon, before, have you? I don’t want to ruin it for people, you know? Whenever people say it’s Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go, ""Yup, that’s right.""', 'This article led to quite a bit of backtracking from both Groening and Jean as they then claimed the location of the town still remained a mystery. The show responded to the article with a chalkboard gag where Bart Simpson repeatedly wrote, ""The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours.""', 'Jean told Jean told TV Guide at the time that Smithsonian Magazine ""misinterpreted something [he has] heard [Groening] say for at least 10 or 20 years."" Jean continued, ""He was inspired by growing up in Portland, but it’s really an every town. It’s really funny. Matt grew up in Oregon and parts of ‘The Simpsons’ were definitely inspired by his childhood. But there is no specific state that Springfield is in, and we will never reveal that secret.""', 'Further trying to dispel that Groening revealed the location, Jean reminded TV Guide readers that ""The Simpsons Movie"" hinted that the town’s true whereabouts are geographically impossible.', '""In the movie we say [Springfield] borders on Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky,"" said Jean. ""So good luck finding that state. When you do, you’re a true ‘Simpsons’ fan.""', 'For what it’s worth, Ohio has a city named Oregon. The state of Oregon does border Nevada. The city of Portland, Oregon, was named after the city of Portland, Maine. And there is an unincorporated community that calls itself ""Oregon"" in Kentucky.', 'In a way (however tenuous), all of those named states from the movie have geographical connections to Oregon. ""The Simpsons"" Springfield = Springfield, Oregon. The homepage of the official website for the Oregonian city even claims, ""Yes, this is the ‘real’ Springfield from ‘The Simpsons.’""', 'Of course, even if this is true, Jean and Groening will likely never fully admit it.

One is that people are likely to be biased upwards in their time estimates, because it’s socially desirable to say you go long into the night.', 'The other problem is that people don’t necessarily know how long they go for. Sex isn’t something people normally do while monitoring the bedside clock, and unassisted time estimation may be difficult during a transportative session of love-making.', 'What does the research say?', 'The best study we have estimating the average time to ejaculation in the general population involved 500 couples from around the world timing themselves having sex over a four-week period – using a stopwatch.', 'That is as practically awkward as it sounds: participants pressed ""start"" at penile penetration and ""stop"" at ejaculation.

Incidentally, this could explain why it becomes painful for a man to continue thrusting after ejaculating, since that would risk scooping out his own semen as well.', 'So what to do with this information?

""I call that the secret ingredient. Nobody knew what white pepper was.

Cooks Illustrated says that it has a more floral, earthy flavor and greater complexity, while black pepper is more aromatic with more spicy heat. Interestingly, Google searches for white pepper have doubled over the past decade.', 'White pepper also has some powerful physiological effects thanks to a compound called piperine. Piperine has been shown to do a wide variety of things, including activating taste receptors to make salt taste saltier and sugar taste sweeter, activating a special receptor in your brain that triggers the release of feel-good endorphins, increasing intestinal water flow and production of digestive enzymes, and possibly even helping to counteract the effects of high-fat diets.', 'The upshot, according to Witherly, is that it could make KFC more addicting.', '""One of the theories I\'ve put forth is that if you eat something that does something to you and it\'s beneficial, your brain figures it out ... it wants you to do it again,"" Witherly says.', ""KFC's alleged secret recipe is as follows:"", '2 cups white flour plus 2/3 tbsp. salt', '1/2 tbsp. thyme', '1/2 tbsp. basil', '1/3 tbsp. oregano', '1 tbsp. celery salt', '1 tbsp. black pepper', '1 tbsp. dried mustard', '4 tbsp. paprika', '2 tbsp. garlic salt', '1 tbsp. ground ginger', '3 tbsp. white pepper', 'As great as white pepper may be, of course, other factors may be more important in making it delicious.

The perverted powwow officially began when one friend, let’s call him Freddy, announced something to the effect of, ""Having your prostate milked is awesome.""', 'I nearly choked on my beer. Someone else chimed in: ""It’s the male g-spot."" Another head nodded. A female friend walked into our circle at that moment and nonchalantly volunteered: ""Yeah, my ex-boyfriend liked me to stick a finger in his butt.""', 'Well, then. It wasn’t the first time I’d heard young heterosexual men talking about being on the receiving end of a wandering finger, or female friends dishing on their male partners’ self-directed anal fixation, but the consensus in the room was startling nonetheless. For perhaps the first time in my life, I felt like a sexual square.', 'Then, a week later, heavily circulated rumors (that have been completely unverified) alleged that R&B singer Usher’s unreleased sex tape showed him on the receiving end of sex with his wife (perhaps wielding a strap-on). It’s no secret that more Americans are having anal sex than ever before: A study published last year in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that more than 45 percent of women in their late 20s had tried anal sex. For my generation, the back-door option is like what the blow job was to the generation that came before — just a fun new taboo waiting to be broken. The phenomenon of heterosexual guys participating in all sorts of arse play is something different, though. I’ve seen female-on-male strap-on sex go from the sort of thing tittered about in women’s magazines to hearing a male friend once drunkenly blurting out in a bar that he loved it.', 'But I live in San Francisco; my sample is skewed. I set out to find some reliable data on the matter, but no such luck. As Debby Herbenick, a co-author of the study mentioned above and a sexual health educator at the Kinsey Institute, told me: ""There is no good national-level data on this topic."" Her research reflected that 11 percent of men in their early 20s reported having been on the receiving end of anal sex. But that survey didn’t specify whether there was a sex toy or penis involved, or if it was oral or digital stimulation.', 'Without solid stats, the best way to get some perspective on this phenomenon is to talk to sexologists. Charlie Glickman, a Good Vibrations sex educator, told me that he believed ""more heterosexual men are discovering prostate and anal play with their female partners than ever before."" His colleague Carol Queen, a staff sexologist, says, ""Lots of guys don’t talk about [it], but do it anyway,"" and ""plenty of heterosexual men include anal penetration in masturbation at least sometimes."" In the years after her educational X-rated video ""Bend Over Boyfriend"" premiered in 1998, it was the shop’s best-selling tape, and the top rental. Tristan Taormino, the sex educator behind several anal-focused porn flicks, including the ""Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men,"" has noticed that guys are increasingly ""feeling safe enough to explore their fantasies"" in this area.', 'Part of this is due to the practice rising to mainstream awareness. In 2001, popular sex columnist Dan Savage held a contest to come up with a slang word to describe the act. The winner was ""peg"" (the runner-up was ""bob,"" as in ""bend over boyfriend""). It’s a lot easier to talk about when you have a cute verb to describe it. Another major factor is that the stigma of receptive anal play as ""a gay thing"" has been somewhat lessened. I’ve seen defensively heterosexual guys boast about prostate stimulation; these are the kind of guys I’ve actually heard use the irritating I’m-not-gay qualifier ""No homo"" (as in, ""I like your shirt — no homo"") — before I wallop them over the head. They haven’t adopted a more fluid understanding of sexual orientation or anything; they’ve just welcomed a new form of stimulation into their definition of acceptable straight sex. As Carol Queen joked, ""I wish I had a nickel for every time I’ve had to explain that it is the gender of the partner rather than the sex act desired that speaks to a person’s sexual orientation.""']",Bringing up the rear,Sex experts think that more straight men are exploring a formerly taboo hot spot.
