Researchers announced their conclusion, in addition to other findings, in a presentation Wednesday during the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco. The team of scientists specifically looked at the chemical composition of the ozone hole, which has shifted in both size and depth since the passing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. The agreement banned its 197 signatory countries from using chemicals, like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that break down into chlorine in the upper atmosphere and harm the ozone layer. They found that, while levels of chlorine in the atmosphere have indeed decreased as a result of the protocol, it\\'s too soon to tie them to a healthier ozone layer. \"Ozone holes with smaller areas and a larger total amount of ozone are not necessarily evidence of recovery attributable to the expected chlorine decline,\" Susan Strahan of NASA\\'s Goddard Space Flight Center explained in a media briefing. \"That assumption is like trying to understand what\\'s wrong with your car\\'s engine without lifting the hood.\" Instead, the scientists believe the most recent ozone hole changes, including both the largest hole ever, in 2006, and one of the smallest holes, in 2012, are primarily due to weather. Strong winds have the ability to move ozone in large quantities, effectively blocking the hole some years, while failing to block it in others. \"At the moment, it is winds and temperatures that are really controlling how big [the ozone hole] is,\" Strahan told the BBC. LiveScience reports weather is expected to be the predominant factor in the ozone hole\\'s size until 2025, at which point CFCs will have dropped enough as a result of the Montreal Protocol to become noticeable. By 2070, however, the ozone hole is expected to have made a full recovery. \"It’s not going to be a smooth ride,\" Strahan cautioned the Los Angeles Times. \"There will be some bumps in the road, but overall the trend is downward.\" Hole In Ozone Layer Expected To Make Full Recovery By 2070: NASA',\n",

That\\'s compared to money, which accounts for just 5.4 percent of how happy an employee is with the job. Achievement and prestige, power and influence, work-life balance and affiliation and friendship were all rated more important to job satisfaction than money. \"These findings are quite surprising, because employers often assume things like income are the strongest drivers of happiness in the workplace,\" said Steve Lehr, Cangrade\\'s chief science officer. \"In fact, our research shows that it may be the weakest.\" Researchers developed a three-part formula for employers who are eager to keep their staff happy: Try to ensure that jobs provide intellectual stimulation and task variety. Give employees some autonomy, influence and opportunities to acquire prestige and recognition. Employers should give employees these things even when they don\\'t say they need them. Give them even more if they say they do. Employers should give all employees a break now and again, including the consummate workaholics who say they don\\'t want or need it. Offer employees extra money, security and social opportunities. However, only to the extent they say these things matter to them. \"If there is a major takeaway here, it\\'s that we can finally prove that money doesn\\'t buy happiness, and that happiness isn\\'t as elusive as we might think,\" said Cangrade CEO Michael Burtov. The study was based on surveys of nearly 600 U.S. employees. Intellectual Stimulation Trumps Money For Employee Happiness, Survey Finds',\n",

But now the perfect way to cook the rice has been shared on question-and-answer website Quora - and all it requires is one piece of equipment. Users were responding to the question 'How does one cook rice properly?' - proving that the basics are not always as simple to cook as we may think. Scroll down for video  The top voted answer for how to cook perfectly, which has been used more than 4,000 times, was refreshingly simple - but it does require some investment. Several commenters agreed that the best way to cook rice is in a rice cooker, which you can pick up from most high street stores for between £15 and £20. Cliff Chang wrote: 'Seriously, it's so much easier than any other method I've tried. 'Take your rice, wash it a bit - not too much - add enough water so that the waterline is twice as high as the rice-line. That is, slightly more water than rice in the pot as the water fills in the nooks between the grains of rice. 'Turn it on. Wait. Delicious rice! You can tweak a little bit if you like your rice fluffier or firmer.' Susan Shao also had some top tips for using a rice cooker - but many can apply to boiling rice using a pan as well. 'When using a rice cooker, I follow these steps and the rice always comes out perfectly. 'If you're not making sushi, wash the rice by rinsing it in cold water with your hand, making swirl motions three times. If you're making sushi rice, repeat this process 10 times instead of three. 'When you add rice, the general rule of thumb is half a cup of rice per person.' She also advises adding just enough water to cover the rice.  But Jireh Tan offers an alternative for those who don't have a rice cooker, or don't want to invest in the equipment. Saying this technique has 'never' failed him, he advises washing the rice first, before measuring rice and water into a pot at a ratio of one cup of rice to 1.5 cups of water. He adds: 'With pot uncovered, bring water to the boil, and boil for an additional two minutes. 'Place the lid on the pot, reduce heat to lowest possible. Simmer for another eight minutes. 'Take the pot off the heat. With the lid on, let the rice rest for another 15 minutes.  'Remove the lid and fluff the rice, allowing any excess moisture to evaporate.'  He adds that the lid should not be removed when taken off the heat, as otherwise the bottom of the pan may end up black and burnt with rice sticking to it.

              "  'context': 'Plenty has been made of the big Congressional Budget Office finding that 24 million people could lose their insurance under Republicans\\' Obamacare replacement over the next decade. That\\'s higher than expected and poses a clear and massive hurdle for Republicans as they attempt to convince dozens of skeptical members. But there\\'s another number that paints a particularly dire picture for the GOP\\'s alternative — especially in light of President Trump\\'s populist rhetoric. According to the CBO, 64-year olds making $26,500 per year would see their premiums increase by an estimated 750 percent by 2026. While they are on track to pay $1,700 under the current law, the CBO projects the American Health Care Act would force them to pay $14,600. Even if you grant that inflation will allow them to make slightly more money by 2026, that\\'s still about half of their income going to health care. Here\\'s how that looks as a percentage of income (h/t Philip Bump): As skeptics of the law noted, that suggests the reason premiums as a whole will eventually decline is because older, poorer people simply won\\'t be able to afford it. The legislation reduces premiums substantially for younger people but increases them substantially for older people — and especially poorer, older people — according to the CBO. The CBO\\'s estimate of the premium increases for older, poorer Americans is actually worse than a previous one from AARP. Here\\'s what AARP, which has announced its opposition to the bill, said last week: ... Our estimates find that, taken together, premiums for older adults could increase by as much as $3,600 for a 55-year old earning $25,000 a year, $7,000 for a 64-year old earning $25,000 a year and up to $8,400 for a 64-year old earning $15,000 a year. If you\\'re a Republican looking at these numbers, you have to be concerned — just from a self-preservation standpoint. Republican leaders have made great pains to argue that the CBO\\'s estimate of the millions who will lose insurance is faulty, or even that it\\'s a necessary side effect of returning to a more free-market approach to health care. But the GOP\\'s counter-argument is predicated on the idea that its alternative would at least allow people access to coverage. Paying such a substantial portion of one\\'s income on health insurance doesn\\'t meet that goal — if, in fact, the CBO\\'s estimate is anywhere close to accurate. It also affects a group of voters who are integral to the Trump Coalition. Less-formally educated and lower-income white Americans were the backbone of the electoral shift that allowed President Trump to be elected, and he has promised them the world: Coverage that is even more affordable than the Affordable Care Act and \"insurance for everybody.\" On top of all that, older people are much more likely to vote than younger people, especially in a midterm election like 2018. So basically, Trump\\'s win was built on older, poorer people, for whom this law appears to drive up premiums and drive down the insurance rate, while benefiting the younger and wealthier. That\\'s not something that will assure skeptical Republicans at all — even if they can get past that 24 million number. This may be the most brutal number in the CBO report',\n",

The reality TV star has a long history battling drug addiction, and has been arrested several times.

              "  'context': 'Almost every place you shop online has a \"promotional code\" box at checkout -- but fewer than a quarter of shoppers use it. We asked the experts for their best advice on where and how to cash in. By Lynn Andriani Start With Your Wardrobe David Weinrot, chief marketing officer at the coupon code site Tada!, says apparel is the top category for sitewide coupon codes (flowers and home goods are big, too), since there\\'s so much inventory and retailers constantly need to make room for new items. Clothing is also where you\\'ll find the biggest discounts, says Daniel Washburn, general manager of another coupon-code site, Coupon Mountain. While some sites broadcast a \"25% off today only!\" coupon code at the top of their home page, more use coupon sites (which get a commission of about 5 percent when you click on a code) to get the word out. There are a couple of tricks to finding these money-saving treasures, aside from searching for a store name with a term like \"coupon\" or \"coupon code,\" says Sarah Jones, coupon editor at DealNews.com. For clothing, she searches the brand name and style name (e.g., \"Michael Kors Chain Lace-Up Shirtdress\") plus the word \"coupon.\" Then she searches for coupons for stores that sell the item, to see what they are currently offering. The idea is to do a mix of general and specific searches to see what comes up. Upgrade Your Electronics Piece by Piece Tech retailers, such as TigerDirect and Newegg, release the most coupon codes, says Jones -- but you won\\'t find 30 percent off everything sitewide with those retailers. Since the category has such small margins, stores can\\'t afford to discount widely; instead, they offer codes that give heavy discounts for particular items. For the quickest results, Jones likes to search by model number (this works especially well for electronics and computers). Shop At The Beginning Of The Month -- Or On A Monday Most retailers release their codes onto sales channels at the beginning of the month, and the majority expire on the 15th or 30th. In particular, Weinrot says retailers that sell items that need replenishing -- such as vitamins, diapers and contact-lens solutions -- tend to release coupon codes early in the month, since they know that\\'s when people tend to restock. You can look for codes throughout the month on Mondays, since many stores rotate new offers on a weekly basis, says Jones. Do The Math Prices vary widely: You might find that one store\\'s price without a coupon might be better than another store\\'s price with one. Also consider shipping costs. For instance, a store that has everyday free shipping may have a price that comes out lower with a 10-percent-off coupon than another store\\'s 20-percent coupon with shipping charges added, says Jones. A general rule of thumb: For smaller purchases, take a free shipping code over a code for 10 percent off; for larger purchases, 10 percent (or more) off will probably save you more money than free shipping would. Know Who Discounts Some stores rarely or never offer coupon codes (Jones cites Walmart and Zappos as examples).

              "  'context': 'DIS, -1.77% An alligator killed a 2-year-old boy at a Walt Disney Worldresort in Orlando, Fla. earlier this month, prompting discussions about safety in the area where he was pulled underwater. Despite the fear this type of tragedy causes, the odds of a fatal alligator attack in the U.S. are small. In fact, bees, wasps, hornets, dogs and even cows kill more Americans each year than alligators — or even sharks — do. The Washington Post used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — the U.S. health agency based in Atlanta — to show which animals cause the most deaths in the country each year . The CDC tracks Americans’ deaths based on their death certificates to keep detailed records on mortality. Bees, wasps and hornets caused the most deaths, an average of 58 per year between 2001 and 2013, according to the Post’s analysis of the CDC data. Cows killed 20 people each year, dogs killed 28, and a separate category called \"other mammals\" accounted for 52 deaths per year. Sharks, alligators and bears killed one person each year, on average. The deaths caused by cows don’t include health problems from eating beef; according to the CDC, most of the cow-related deaths happen to people working with cattle in enclosed areas or herding them. Their handlers typically have died from blunt force trauma to their heads or chests. That said, alligator attacks happen more often than once a year; they just aren’t always fatal. Alligators bit nine people in 2015 in the state of Florida, and one of them fatally — a 61-year-old man who was snorkeling was killed by a 12-foot alligator — according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. That was slightly fewer bites than in the preceding years; in 2013, alligators bit 15 people, and in 2012 and 2014 they bit 10. Because in Florida’s population has been growing (it reached more than 20.2 million in 2015 , up from 18.8 million in 2010, according to the U.S. Census) there has also been an increase in alligator complaints, according to the Commission; it has fielded an average of 16,000 alligator-related complaints each year in the last decade. As a result, the Commission has a Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program that allows the killing of 7,000 \"nuisance alligators\" each year.

Paphos, on the island\\'s west coast, and also one of 2017’s two European Capitals of Culture, ranked first in an analysis of package holiday prices and on-the-ground costs in 10 popular winter sun destinations.  The research conducted by the Post Office calculated the cost of a February half-term package holiday for two adults and two children, along with eight essential holiday purchases spread, including seven bottles of beer, 14 cups of coffee, and seven three-course family meals. Cyprus, \"a land for romantics, dotted with castles, churches, monasteries, mosaics, white-sand beaches and the bluest of seas\", according to our expert, Fiona Hardcastle, beat Lanzarote to first place. The former recorded overall costs of £1,131, next to the latter’s £1,664. In third place was Cancun in Mexico, with all the items costing £2,106, the only destination in the top five not to use the euro. The Mexican peso is the only currency weaker against the pound than a year ago in the research, with Britons receiving around 2.5 per cent more for their money. \"Sterling’s recent rally means that holidaymakers will not have to dig quite so far into their pockets as they would have had to do a few weeks ago,\" explained the Post Office’s Andrew Brown. \"However, there are big difference in prices among winter sun resorts and these can really have an impact on the overall holiday budget.\" The more expensive destinations in the ranking were all long-haul, with Jumeirah in Dubai, the dearest, with overall costs of £3,266. In ninth place was Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic (£2,791); in eighth was Penang in Malaysia (£2,382). \"Bargain-hunters will be well advised to add the cost of meals and drinks in resorts to the price of a holiday package to find the destination that will give them the best overall value,\" added Brown. \"In places like Dubai where meal and drinks prices are high, booking all-inclusive packages will keep their costs down.\" Last month, the Post Office’s annual global holiday costs barometer rated the Algarve in Portugal, once again, as the cheapest place in the world for a summer holiday.

The Internet search giant paid a tax rate of 2.6 percent on $8.1 billion in non-U.S. income in 2012, because it channelled almost all of its overseas profits to a subsidiary in Bermuda which levies no corporate income tax, the group\\'s accounts show. Corporate tax avoidance has risen to the top of the international agenda in the past year with the G20 and G8 groups of leading economies promising to get to grips with the growing practice of companies diverting profits from where they are earned and into tax havens. Google said it follows all tax rules in every country where it operates and that it does not pay much tax in Britain because its profits are not generated by its UK employees. Google UK Ltd, and other subsidiaries across mainland Europe, pay little tax because they are designated as providers of marketing services to Google Ireland Ltd, the Dublin-based subsidiary whose name appears on invoices to most non-U.S. clients. Google declares little profit in Ireland because the unit there sends almost all of the profit earned from the non-U.S. clients to the Bermudan affiliate, in the form of licence fees for the use of Google intellectual property. The parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) grilled Google\\'s Northern Europe boss, Matt Brittin, in May after a Reuters investigation showed the company had advertised dozens of jobs for salespeople, despite Brittin telling the committee last year that the company does not pay tax on its UK revenues because it does not conduct sales from British territory. A PAC report later accused of Google of using \"contrived\" mechanisms to avoid tax and called on the government to change the rules on taxing multinational companies. Google\\'s Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said attempts to force technology companies to pay more tax could stymie innovation. Google\\'s UK tax charge on 2012 income was only 11.6 million pounds, with 24 million being payable in relation to employee share based remuneration.

The feeling of being able to bring in a new life into this world is totally overwhelming. Most of the times, even big and strong men can’t help but get emotional once they see their babies for the very first time. When it comes to fatherly excitement, one man from Canada can say that he felt more than any other dad-to-be in the world. He was waiting to see not only his first baby but five! His heart was filled with desire and excitement to kiss and hold his Quintuplets. But when the most awaited day of his life came, he had never prepared for the news that hit him so hard in the face. The Father-To-Be Paul Servat is a man in his mid-thirties. He was living in Montreal with his family and friends. Due to his busy schedule, he never realized that he was growing old. Looking at his friends happy and content with their own families, Paul had realized he wanted to build a family of his own. He was at the height of his career, fit and healthy and he knew that it’s time for him to look for his other half. Of course, there’s an accessible place to do so. A Whirlwind Romance At the age of technology, Paul had easily found his match on a dating site. It was 2013 when a woman named Barbara Bienvenue caught his attention. He was two years her junior and he can easily make her laugh. At their age, there was no time for long courtship. After a few weeks of chatting with each other, they decided to meet in Montreal. The two clicked together and they started dating. Soon enough, the whirlwind romance had blossomed into something else. A Sudden But Delightful News Barely two months after dating exclusively, Barbara called Paul and told him that she had something to say. As they were only at the earliest stage of their relationship, Paul had no idea what his girlfriend would say. When they met, Barbara was smiling from ear to ear. And when she told him the good news, there was a quick moment of shock for Paul. But when the news synced in, a big grin formed on his face as well. At last, he’s going to be a father! The Whole Neighborhood Rejoiced Paul was swept away by the news. Just a few months ago, he had longed to build a family of his own. Before he knew it, all that he ever prayed was being handed to him. He couldn’t be any happier. When his family and friends found out about the good news, they all felt happy for the couple. They even held a celebration to express how much delighted they are for what was happening in their lives. From that day on, the excited father-to-be began his countdown. Additional Blessings Additional Blessings As weeks passed by, the couple began to notice that Barbara’s tummy was unusually big. Realizing they might be expecting twins, Barbara went to undergo checkup and when she returned, Paul couldn’t help but jump for joy. They are going to have more than one child, and even more than two. In the begining Paul couldn't believe it, but they were going to have no less than five children! They Must Be Prepared Barbara was one of the lucky women in the world who had conceived quintuplets. Paul couldn’t believe his ears at first. Unlike his friends who had fathered children in their twenties, he was past his prime of becoming a father. But when it was finally given to him, he had it big time! However, there also came his worries. Paul was earning an average income. It was enough to start a family but wouldn’t be sufficient for five. Lucky for them, they had family, friends, and neighbors who were more than willing to lend a helping hand. The preparation for the quintuplets’ arrival has begun. Setting Up a Facebook Page Since the inception of social media platforms, getting help had never been easier. With the help of his friends and co-workers, Paul had set up a Facebook page. He shared their story and used the page to document Barbara’s pregnancy. From his personal to professional contacts, Paul humbly asked for sponsorships. Aside from their neighbors, help from the local businesses in their community had arrived. To be able to show how grateful they are, they took photos of the gifts and posted them on the Facebook page. They want everyone to know that their efforts are paying off. Healthy Pregnancy With each passing day, Paul grew more and more excited. He was always on Barbara’s side whenever she asked for something. He had been so patient of her mood swings and was careful to her like she’s a baby herself. He never wanted anything bad to happen to the mother of his children. So that Barbara wouldn’t get bored in the house, they started arranging the room of their babies. It was such an unforgettable moment for Paul and he felt younger than ever. If only he could, he would pull the days. But for the meantime, he had to be patient. As they say, all good things are worth the wait. Moments to Cherish All throughout the waiting ordeal, Paul felt extremely happy. Even the happiness of his parents who are longing for grandchildren was evident. Her mother was always with Barbara, assisting her in her needs whenever he’s away. Aside from updating the generous people on Facebook, Paul and Barbara had solemn moments as well. His girlfriend had given him the opportunity to pick the names for their babies and he deeply appreciates it. A month before the due date, Paul was confident that they were ready. The Time Has Come Barbara was on her 34th week when it happened. She was hysterical as she told Paul that her water broke. Usually, a full-term pregnancy consists of 37 weeks. It was his first time to deal with this kind of situation. However, he knew from his research that he needed to stay calm. As fast as he could, he prepared the things and took his girlfriend to the hospital. His family accompanied them as well. Finally, the most awaited day of his life has arrived. Necessary Precautions When they arrived at the hospital, the doctors attended to Barbara right away. Since she was not yet in the pain of labor, the necessary processes were done. She was checked up and the doctor performed an ultrasound. Paul was nervous and excited at the same time. He was waiting outside for great news. When the doctor finally went out, Paul was quite surprised at the expression on his face. He’s looking confused. Could there be a problem with the babies? His heart skipped a beat. Misunderstanding and Confusion Judging by the frown on his face, Paul can sense that something was wrong. The staff nurses were clearly uneasy as well. He can’t wait for answers any longer. He approached the doctor. Paul was then taken aside. The doctor was unsure where to start. Perhaps he was even contemplating on the fact that he discovered. Then, like a sword, his words hit Paul’s heart and mind. What Went Wrong? In his excitement, Paul had a hard time accepting what the doctor was saying. His girlfriend was still inside the emergency room. His family was around him, all were eagerly waiting for Barbara’s safe delivery. However, the doctor was explaining there were no babies to expect at all. Barbara was not pregnant in the first place. For the love of God, Paul couldn’t understand what was happening. How on Earth could this happen? Seeing the Signs For almost nine months, Paul had been with Barbara. He saw her belly grew and he was there when her morning sickness was on its height. She was starting to make milk as well. Even his mom had never sensed that there’s something weird that’s going on. Then like a clap of thunder, it hit him. He was never there when Barbara went to the clinic for checkups. At first, she told him they were expecting twins. Then the next time it became triplets. The following she told her she was carrying four babies. Then it became five. Paul was beginning to feel like a fool. It was then that the doctor told her about Barbara’s condition. Shocked and Stunned After months of joy, excitement, thrill, and preparations, Paul was shocked to the core. They were living under one roof and he never had the slightest idea that Barbara was faking her pregnancy. He saw the signs with his own eyes. From time to time, they took photos and uploaded them on their Facebook page in hopes of getting sponsorship. No one close to them had even suspected that there was no baby at all. At that moment, he became unsure whether there was someone close to them who had the idea that Barbara was lying all along. And then there was one. A Woman’s Skepticism Genevieve Laflamme is the first person to sense that something weird was happening. She recently gave birth to triplets. Although she had some suspicions in her mind, she just can’t barge in and tell Paul. He was too happy and excited. Instead of trusting her intuition, she just convinced herself to believe that Barbara was indeed carrying quintuplets. Moreover, she provided her with tips on where they can get financial support. Genevieve even connected Paul and Barbara to the generous folks who sponsored the diapers for her triplets. Upon learning the news, she quite regretted her decision of keeping silent about her suspicions. Living with Lies Paul was not the only one who was brokenhearted with the news. His parents, relatives, and friends were all shocked as well. Even the friend who helped him set up the Facebook page for sponsorship couldn’t help but get annoyed and disappointed with all of Barbara’s lies. He was so in love and caught up with the idea of becoming a father. He couldn’t think of any reason why the woman she loved and trusted with all his heart would make a fool out of him. Then he found out it was not the first time. Family’s Knowledge During their brief relationship, Paul never had the chance to ask Barbara about her family. All that he knew about his girlfriend was that she was from Quebec as well. Barbara didn’t want to talk about her relatives so he respected her silence. When the hoax came out, a relative of Barbara came forward and told Paul that it was not the first time Barbara fooled people. She had long cut ties with them because of her unusual behavior. They were devastated to know that she did again. Lies in the Past The relative, who didn’t want to mention his name, told Paul that Barbara had an ex-boyfriend in the past who suffered the same fate as him. She told the man that she was pregnant with twins. Like Paul, the ex-couple had raised funds to prepare for the coming of the babies. But in the end, Barbara’s lies were exposed as well. When Barbara left her hometown, the relatives were pretty sure she will never live in lies again. Her honor had been compromised and she promised them that she will lead a better life. But did Barbara really deserve to be condemned or was she a victim as well. What Barbara Really Needs Although Paul was angry at the deception, his family had talked to him about how to handle his emotions. The doctors were empathetic. In his mind, he was thinking about the friends and sponsors that are all waiting for their announcement. He had plenty of explanations to do. At the hospital, the doctor talked about phantom pregnancy. Based on the explanation, what happened wasn’t totally under Barbara’s control. The woman he loved needs deeper understanding. Moreover, she needs medical attention. What is Phantom Pregnancy? Pseudocyesis or commonly known as phantom pregnancy is a condition wherein a woman convinces herself that she’s actually pregnant. It’s easy to fall trap as the signs and symptoms of a real pregnancy can be seen and experienced. According to WebMD, the exact cause of phantom pregnancy is yet unknown. However, they have found out that the extreme desire of a woman to become pregnant is one of the psychological factors. It even causes changes in the body. This condition is really hard to differentiate from real pregnancy. Expectant Father-to-be of Quintuplets Gets the Biggest Shock of His Life on His Most Awaited Day\",\n",

              "  'context': 'Most successful businesses operate by following a fundamental set of core values. Their vision and mission statement reflect these values, the day to day operations are driven by them and they dictate how major decisions are made. Having core values provides a clarity that fosters focus and makes prioritizing easy. As human beings, we all have a personal set of core values that reflect the essence of who we are. We all have them. However having them and consciously allowing them to guide you through life are two entirely different things. Understanding and living a life driven by your own personal values is one of the major keys to success, happiness and inner peace. Write it out The first step in living a life full of purpose and passion is to write down your own personal values. Your values, though tied to your morals and ethics are not a system of right or wrong. Your personal values are the things you value the most. What drives you? What makes you feel alive, energized and invigorated? Is it love, family, money, career, popularity, serving others, social justice, rescuing animals? The list goes on and on. What do you love? What matters to you? Now that you have identified them–write them down. Why? Research shows that writing down your values yields dozens of positive results such as: You get a true picture of who you really are and what you stand for. To get what you truly want, you must be who you truly are. who you truly are. You will begin to manage your time better. You will learn to make better choices about where you spend your time. about where you spend your time. Knowing and being true to what really matters to you will ignite your passion for your purpose and being able to fulfill your purpose fuels that passion even more. The two are interdependent and keep you motivated and moving forward. Our values are like our internal compass. They keep us headed toward our true north. When we get off course, having them written down helps us notice sooner. Writing about our values helps remind us of where we need to be and it helps us get back on track more easily. Our values are our roots that keep us grounded in what’s important to us. Having them written down visually reminds us to stay true to who we really are. In short, discovering, defining, writing down and living your core values helps to ensure that you get more of the right things done and makes the journey so much more enjoyable. Seeing your personal values in writing reduces stress Dr. Kelly McGonigal, Stanford Professor and author of the book The Upside of Stress, has studied the impact that connecting our personal values to our experiences–specifically journaling about the connection–has on our overall health, well-being and ability to cope with stress. According to Dr. McGonigal’s research there are life altering benefits to writing about our personal values: \"In the long term, writing about values has been shown to boost GPAs, reduce doctor visits, improve mental health, and help with everything from weight loss to quitting smoking and reducing drinking. It helps people persevere in the face of discrimination and reduces self-handicapping. In many cases, these benefits are a result of a one-time mindset intervention. People who write about their values once, for ten minutes, show benefits months or even years later.\" McGonigal believes that writing about how the events of our day match up with our deepest personal values can mentally and biologically improve our ability to deal with stress. In the cases she studied she found that: \"Stressful experiences were no longer simply hassles to endure; they became an expression of values... small things that might otherwise have seemed irritating became moments of meaning.\" Putting it in to action When our actions and activities don’t align with our values, we feel less authentic and become demotivated in our daily lives.. Below are a few simple steps to assist you in aligning your actions, activities, goals and life purpose with your own unique set of values: Writing it down: Choose the top five (or less) things you value most in life and write them down. Define what each of those values means to YOU. Reflect on your day (or week). What went well? When did you feel stressed? Why? Select one or two highs and one or two stressful events and briefly jot down how they connect to at least one of your core values. Select one or two core values and jot down something you can do the next day (or during the following week) that will positively reflect that value. Self Assessment: As time progresses, keep a tally of how many times you purposefully and intentional engage in activities that positively reflect your value system Assess your stress levels. Are you feeling more or less stressed/anxious since you began the exercise? How is your passion and motivation? Do you feel driven? Assess your physical well-being. How are you feeling overall? What changes have you noticed (more or less: headaches, neck and back pain, tension, upset stomach. etc.). Plan your action: what can you do to keep this moment going? The most important thing you can do for your personal success today is to not only know your core values, but live them. Allow them to become a part of your day to day life. Write about them and learn to see them in everything you do. A life lined-up with personal values is a well-lived, purpose-filled life. ENDORSED BY Ricky Tang Editor Love this article?

              "  'context': 'Romantic comedies have become so rare that when the trailer for \"What If\" with Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan premiered last week, Vulture\\'s Amanda Dobbins wrote, \"It looks like someone actually made a rom-com in 2014?\" Indeed, a genre that produced some of the most loved films of all-time -- anything written by Nora Ephron, for instance -- has all but disappeared from the multiplex. This is the world that \"Obvious Child\" enters into on Friday, following six successful months on the festival circuit. \"It is 100 percent made to be a romantic comedy,\" director Gillian Robespierre told HuffPost Entertainment when asked if she would consider her new film part of Hollywood\\'s once-favored genre. \"That\\'s a genre I love, and we just took that style -- boy meets girl -- and put a little twist on it. We messed it up a little bit. I hope people call it a romantic comedy, and I\\'m proud to have it called that.\" Robespierre \"messed it up a little bit\" by focusing her love story on a stand-up comic named Donna (Jenny Slate) who has a one-night stand, gets pregnant and decides to have an abortion. According to Robespierre, \"Obvious Child\" -- which was first a 2009 short film that also starred Slate -- was created as an answer to films such as \"Knocked Up\" and \"Juno,\" where unexpected pregnancies led to new families. \"They just didn’t feel true,\" Robespierre told the New York Times in a recent interview. \"I\\'m so neurotic that I\\'m sure there\\'s backlash out there,\" the director said about her film, which debuted at this year\\'s Sundance Film Festival to near-universal praise. \"Not just from the right, but from people who think scatological jokes are lowbrow or unintelligent and everyone who makes them are boring neanderthals. But! Those people are not fun people. Farts are funny. I think you\\'re kind of a robot if you don\\'t think so. You don\\'t have to love the movie, but you have to love a fart sound.\" Robespierre has such a fondness for fart sounds that she includes one in her movie\\'s meet-cute: Donna\\'s one-night stand, Max (Jake Lacy from \"The Office\"), accidentally farts in her direction while she\\'s squatting to pee in the street. (It later earns him the nickname \"Pee Farter.\") \"I like our movie because I think that it\\'s satisfying in the way that traditional rom-coms are satisfying, but that it\\'s storyline is just more modern and less squeaky clean,\" Slate said. \"But it\\'s not trying to be shocking.\" Slate, 32, is best known for her one-season stint on \"Saturday Night Live,\" guest appearances on \"Bored to Death\" and \"Parks and Recreation\" and Marcel The Shell, a short film that she made with her now-husband, Dean Fleisher-Camp. (According to the actress, plans are still in motion for a Marcel feature film, though nothing is set in stone.) Like Donna, she\\'s a stand-up comic in real life, often performing in Brooklyn. \"When we saw her on stage, before we started working on the short, we felt like she was saying what was going on in our head,\" Robespierre said of finding her lead actress. \"She was so funny and charming, and also beautiful and wearing dresses and very feminine. She was saying everything we thought, and always have been thinking, about our bodies and families and life. It was one of those moments where you wanted her to either be in a movie or be your best friend.\" Playing a stand-up comic was not necessarily difficult for Slate, but she and Robespierre made sure that Donna had her own style. \"She doesn\\'t realize that she doesn\\'t have to put everything out there,\" Slate said. \"She doesn\\'t realize she\\'s spraying the area and some people don\\'t want to be sprayed. But it\\'s also satisfying for her to put everything out there.\" Robespierre structures \"Obvious Child\" around three stand-up routines. The first introduces Donna and her openness with jokes about her then-boyfriend and life views in general. (She is pro-farting, as it turns out.) The second is more of a meltdown, with Donna lashing out after being dumped. The third happens the night before her scheduled abortion procedure. \"That to me was totally alien to me. I wouldn\\'t do that,\" Slate said of the final performance, where Donna reveals to an audience of mostly strangers that she\\'s having an abortion. \"I might do it after the fact. But, in general, I tend to not bring up subjects that seem like hot-button issues in my standup. Because I feel like I have too much of my own personal shit to sort out first, and I don\\'t feel that I\\'m up for it. I don\\'t feel I have anything very funny to say about big issues. For Donna, she\\'s not talking about a big issue. She\\'s talking about herself. So that I relate to. I relate to her understanding that it is in her nature to be confessional. Her nature is not going to change, even though she has to go through a big experience.\" Slate has been praised for her performance in \"Obvious Child,\" though the plaudits have come in two different forms: Depending on the publication, she\\'s either enjoying a breakout moment or her comeback. \"I don\\'t even think about those things at all. I\\'m grateful that people are writing about the movie, but I don\\'t walk around with a clear narrative of myself,\" Slate said of the opposing media designations placed upon her this year. \"I literally just think about myself day by day. It sucks in a way, because I don\\'t want to be labeled as someone. To me, it\\'s not that simple. [...] I can only do my shit.\" \\'Obvious Child\\' Is A Romantic Comedy, Thank You Very Much',\n",

And people can’t stop wondering what exactly his title will be. Hillary has been asked this question repeatedly during her campaign (which probably gets annoying), and she’s brought up an important point: Now, it’s a little bit more complicated with him because people still call former presidents Mr. President. So I have to really work on this. After all, you can’t be calling someone Mr. President every day right next to Madam President. Hillary mused on the issue with Jimmy Kimmel.

I’ve already told my husband that if I’m so fortunate enough to be president and he will be the first gentleman.

I've used three pieces of your advice in my job search and that's how I got the two job offers I'm considering now. I was job-hunting for six months and I didn't get even one interview during that time. I completed over 100 online job applications. Even as I was filling out the forms I felt that it was a helpless, useless process. All of the online applications are the same, no matter which company you apply to work for. They all want to know how long you worked at each job and they all ask about your Tasks and Duties. Isn't it obvious from your job title what your Tasks and Duties in the job were? When I started to read your columns I stopped completing online job applications and I started writing Pain Letters instead. I sent out six Pain Letters at first and I got two replies. One was a very nice email from a hiring manager who isn't looking for any help right now (I had not seen a job ad from her company, but I thought the company sounded interesting) and the other reply came from the HR Director in a second company where I'd sent a Pain Letter to the hiring manager. The HR Director, Paula, said that the hiring manager I had reached with my Pain Letter didn't have any job openings but two other managers did. I interviewed with Paula's company and met both managers, and that's where my first job offer came from. The second job offer came from my third batch of Pain Letters. All in all I have sent out seventeen Pain Letters now, I've had six job interviews and I've got two job offers to decide between. I think I am going to take the offer at Paula's company because the people there were both extremely smart and very nice during the entire interview process. I think the culture is healthier there than it is in the other company where I have a job offer. It's a great company too, but why not work in the healthiest place possible? I am 34 years old and I was raised to follow rules. I guess most people were. I have never broken rules  before the way I did in this job search. I guess anybody who got one of my Pain Letters and didn't like it didn't respond to me, and that's perfectly fine. Here are three major pieces of your advice that I followed: I stopped applying for jobs online, and started sending Pain Letters and my Human-Voiced Resume directly to hiring managers, instead. Along the way I got a lot better at using LinkedIn to conduct research! The Definitive Careers Guide From Forbes encompasses every aspect of the job hunt, from interview to promotion. Discover how to get ahead today. I got a consulting business card and started to give it out at networking events. I haven't had any consulting projects yet but I've grown my network a lot and I've also grown my confidence. I stopped being so shy and timid at interviews. No one is going to know what I can do for them unless I tell them. I used my LinkedIn research to get inside the heads of each of my hiring managers, and I'm sure that's why I have two job offers now. The managers who did get back to me weren't the least bit bothered by my direct approach to them. They were glad. They said that it's really  hard to find people to fill their positions. I figured that was true but because we hear so much about talent shortages you start to think that your skills are a dime a dozen. Now I know that's not true. Thanks for your encouragement, Liz! I don't expect to go back to rule-following in my job search for a long time, if ever. I know that CEOs and other executives don't fill out online job application forms, so why should I?

A six-minute video on the website of the Tribun Timur publication shows villagers slicing open the python's carcass to reveal the legs and torso of the dead victim, named Akbar. Junaedi, the secretary of Salubiro village in West Sulawesi province, told The Associated Press that villagers began searching for Akbar on Monday night after realising he hadn't returned from working on his palm oil crops the previous day. Junaedi said Wednesday that the search party found scattered palm oil fruit, a picking tool and a boot, and then spotted the engorged 7-metre (23-foot) -long reticulated python. When its stomach was cut, we first saw his boot and legs near the neck, He said. It seems he was attacked from behind because we found a wound on his back. Reticulated pythons grab onto their prey with dozens of sharp curved teeth and then squeeze it to death before swallowing it whole. They are widespread in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia. Reports of humans being killed by pythons are extremely rare. In the wild they are known to eat monkeys, pigs and other mammals. Junaedi said Akbar's absence wasn't noticed until Monday because his wife was visiting her parents in another province. The alarm was raised when his uncle called on him and found his house locked. Like many Indonesians, Junaedi uses one name, as did Akbar.

              "  'context': 'Although much attention has focused on concussions in high school sports, shoulder injuries are common as well. And these injuries may vary by sport. A recent study found that football had the highest rate of shoulder injuries among high school students. The high school sport with the lowest rate of shoulder injuries was girls\\' soccer. Less than one in 10 high school students needed surgery for their injuries, and almost half returned to play within a week of their injury. This study, led by T. Walker Robinson, MD, MPH, of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children\\'s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, investigated shoulder injuries among US high school athletes. The researchers collected data about nine sports from a group of 100 nationally representative high schools for the school years ranging from 2005-2006 through 2011-2012. The sports included boys\\' football, soccer, basketball, wrestling and baseball, as well as girls\\' soccer, volleyball, basketball and softball. The researchers looked at the rate of shoulder injuries among the total number of \"athletic exposures,\" defined as a single athlete participating in a single practice or game. To qualify as a shoulder injury, it had to occur as a result of the sport, require attention by a trainer or doctor and either be a fracture and/or result in the athlete having to sit out at least one day from the sport. Out of a little more than 13 million athlete exposures, a total of 2,798 shoulder injuries were reported during the six-year study period. This number translated to approximately 2.15 shoulder injuries sustained for every 10,000 athlete exposures, which matches up with the approximately 820,700 shoulder injuries reported nationwide during this time period. The athletes experienced shoulder injuries three times more often during games and competitions than during practices. The sport with the highest rate of injuries was boys\\' football (almost five injuries per 10,000 exposures), while the lowest was girls\\' soccer (about 0.5 injuries per 10,000 exposures). Only about 8 percent of the injuries required surgery, with almost two thirds of the injuries being either a strain/sprain or a dislocation/separation. About 40 percent of the injured athletes experienced a strain or sprain, and 29 percent experienced a dislocation or separation. While only about 8 percent of the injured athletes ended up having to sit out the season (or their high school career) as a result of their injuries, about 41 percent returned to play within a week. \"Continued prospective surveillance is necessary to monitor injury rates, to gain further information about risk factors leading to shoulder injuries, and ultimately to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based interventions to prevent future shoulder injuries,\" the researchers wrote. This study was published January 13 in the journal Pediatrics. The authors reported no potential conflicts of interest.

Many people have criticized Bernie Sanders’ supporters, describing them as entitled millennials. Critics don’t realize, though, that it is not just the young who want Bernie in office. He appeals to people of all demographics, including 90 year-old men like Dick Van Dyke. Van Dyke started by saying that he is not one to frequently get involved in politics. However, Bernie Sanders, with his vision for America, seems to have brought him back into the political sphere. \"Well, I haven’t campaigned since Eugene McCarthy, so you know how political I am, but I’m 90 degrees — 90 years old so I like to give a hand to young aspiring politicians like Bernie.\" He continued: ‘Bernie has lit a fire that’s been lit a hundred times over the last hundred years but always got sidelined or squelched, but somehow, Bernie has caught the eye and minds of young people and I think this time it’s going to happen.’ He went on to discuss the importance of having a president like Sanders, saying, \"We’ve got to put him in the White House. He goes back to Woodrow Wilson who said there was an invisible force over and above the United States government. The banks and the insurance companies, and it’s been going on that long.

The series is easily one of the most popular within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's pretty easy to imagine Marvel working to complete a full trilogy even if the first sequel is a let (which we certainly don't think it will be). As a result, there is already plenty of anticipation for what could wind up being called Guardians of the Galaxy 3 - but the project has picked up interest from one interesting individual in particular: Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler. The musician/actor recently had the opportunity to have a sizable role in the new indie horror movie Happy Birthday, and it was while sitting down with People magazine that he revealed his interest in being a part of the Marvel family -- specifically out in the cosmos with writer/director James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy. Discussing his feelings about acting post-Happy Birthday and his potential future as an actor, Steven Tyler said, I hope [audiences] enjoy [Happy Birthday]. I know I did! It made me want to do more movies for sure, I would do anything to be in Guardians of the Galaxy 3 -- are you listening James Gunn? Steven Tyler, as mentioned, is best known as the lead singer of Aerosmith, but he does have some acting experience under his belt. In addition to playing himself in movies like Wayne's World 2 and Be Cool, he's also played legitimate roles -- such as in Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express and Epic. Of course, he's also spent time as an American Idol judge, which is a certain level of performance as well. And let's not forget that Tyler already has a family connection within the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well, as his daughter, Liv Tyler, played Betty Ross in The Incredible Hulk. Regardless of his experience and connections, however, whether or not Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 could actually find room for Steven Tyler is a legitimate question. The first film already had a massive ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, John C. Reilly, Michael Rooker and more, and the upcoming sequel is adding to that group with exciting stars like Kurt Russell and Pom Klementieff. I suppose it's possible that Tyler could wind up being given a small but important part -- like the one that Sylvester Stallone will be playing in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.

              "  'context': 'Tree-lined streets, good schools, quiet road and low-intensity streetlights... That last one may not have made it on your checklist for finding your last home, apartment or condo, but doctors now say it probably should have. Even though they save energy, some light-emitting diode (or LED) streetlights are too bright and may actually be putting your health and security at risk, according to new recommendations from the American Medical Association, the largest professional association of doctors in the U.S. The benefits of LED lights include a lot of energy and cost savings. They use up to 50 percent less energy than conventional lights. And the lifetime of LED lights is two to four times that of older, non-LED lights, which means lower maintenance costs for cities that need to change a street’s lightbulbs when they go out. But the bottom line from the AMA is that high-intensity LED streetlights that emit too much blue light can actually throw off sleep patterns of the people living in those neighborhoods and make nighttime glare on roads worse than conventional lights. \"Despite the energy efficiency benefits, some LED lights are harmful when used as street lighting,\" Maya A. Babu, an AMA board member, said in press release. None of the authors of the AMA recommendations were answering questions on the topic, according to the press office. \\'A Strip Mall In Outer Space\\' \"It feels like I’m in a strip mall in outer space,\" Brooklyn resident Jolanta Benal told The New York Times last year, complaining about the bright LED streetlights in her Windsor Terrace neighborhood. New York City is spending $75 million to retrofit its more than 250,000 street lights to be energy-efficient LEDs, the Times reported. The new lights are expected to save the city $6 million in energy costs and $8 million in maintenance each year. But lights like these could also be costing residents like Benal a lot of sleep. The retrofitted streetlights were designed to prevent glare, according to a spokesperson for the city\\'s Department of Transportation. But the current blue light allowance for the new street lights is higher than the new AMA recommendations call for. \"The problem is that if people are not exposed to darkness in the evening then they have a problem going to sleep,\" Maurice Ohayon, director of the Stanford Sleep Epidemiology Research Center, told The Huffington Post. Ohayon and his colleagues recently looked at the sleep habits and sleep quality of more than 15,800 people. They found that people who were exposed to more nighttime light were nearly twice as likely to be dissatisfied with their sleep as those living in areas with less light. Those exposed to more light at night also reported sleeping less at night and having more fatigue during the day. If people are not exposed to darkness in the evening then they have a problem going to sleep. Maurice Ohayon, Stanford University As that exposure to light happens over and over again, our circadian rhythms (the body’s internal clock) get disrupted. And beyond affecting sleep, disordered circadian rhythms are linked to higher rates of chronic diseases, including obesity, heart disease, depression and some cancers. In the same way that blue light from a smartphone or computer screen suppresses melatonin production in the brain (the body’s signal for sleep), it\\'s the blue light in LEDs that causes trouble, Clete Kushida, a neurologist and sleep specialist at Stanford Sleep Medicine Center, explained in a KBCW video. Blame Light Color And Intensity There is actually no such thing as a \"white\" LED light, Stephen Quick, an architect and urban designer, told HuffPost. LED lights that appear white, like the ones used in streetlights are made up of a combination of amber, red, green and blue light, said Quick, an adjunct professor of architecture at Carnegie Mellon University who was not involved in writing the AMA\\'s recommendations. Quick and his colleagues took a deep dive into the research on cost-saving benefits and potential health, safety and aesthetic concerns of LED lights for a report for the city of Pittsburgh in 2011. The report was used to help Pittsburgh finalize its plan to replace its 40,000 streetlights. That research, like the new AMA recommendation, suggested that a neutral color light with about an even mix of blue and the other colors be used for streetlights, Quick said. \"Think incandescent light -- neither warm nor cool [in color]. It’s soft, but it doesn’t have the cool qualities that you’d see in a fluorescent light.\" Quick said that the Pittsburgh report\\'s recommendations did allow for slightly more blue light than the AMA. Brighter But Not Safer The other potential problem with LED streetlights that are too bright, according to the AMA’s recommendation against them, is glare. \"A lot of people believe that the brighter the lights, the safer they are,\" Quick said. But LED light is directional -- meaning it gets emitted in a specific direction, unlike conventional lightbulbs, which put out light and heat in all directions. When the lights are lower consistently, we don’t have the glare problem we do when they’re really bright. Stephen Quick, Carnegie Mellon University Because the light is not diffused, LEDs create a \"glare zone\" for drivers at certain angles that can be worse than conventional streetlights, Quick said. The new AMA recommendations encourage \"proper design, shielding and installation\" to help mitigate glare. Quick also said that dimming the lights would help reduce glare. \"The higher the intensity, the more glare from the bounced light or the direct light,\" he said. \"And when the lights are lower consistently, we don’t have the glare problem we do when they’re really bright.\" The Cost Of Evolving Standards The AMA\\'s new recommendations may call for some rethinking of current green building standards and projects. The U.S. Green Building Council -- the group that runs LEED, the most widely used green building certification program in the world -- does not support one specific type of streetlight over another, Theresa Backhaus, a site technical specialist for LEED, told HuffPost via email. \"We encourage lighting design to take all considerations into account for the health, safety and welfare of people and the environment,\" she said. USGBC\\'s Light Pollution Reduction Credit was created precisely to reduce the harmful effects of light pollution, she said. The credit is one that buildings and development projects can meet to earn one of LEED\\'s four rating levels. That credit requires projects to use lower lighting levels for \"sensitive areas,\" such as residential zones and nature preserves, but does not specify a limit on the amount of blue light that can be used. The good news is that most LEDs, especially newer ones, are made with dimming controls, Quick said -- so the intensity of the light can be adjusted fairly easily. Changing the color balance of the lights can be a lot more difficult. Sometimes it\\'s possible to replace just the LED themselves, Quick said, but sometimes the whole fixture needs to be replaced. \"And that gets costly.\" The takeaway is that there’s nothing inherently bad about the LED lights themselves. \"We save a tremendous amount of energy by using them. We also save a lot of money in maintenance costs,\" Quick said. But getting the color and intensity right is important. \"The best procedure right now is for cities to be cautious and know what they’re buying,\" he added.

They are what get high-profile television advertisements and spark contentious public debate here in the United States. But it turns out they are among the least common methods used around the world. In fact, they rank only slightly more common than the rhythm method or withdrawal. In honor of World Contraception Day, which falls on September 26, we took a look at data around birth control-use worldwide — and some of the most common birth control is pretty surprising. Perhaps most of all that the leading method of contraception is female sterilization, a surgery where a woman is permanently rendered infertile.

Next most common was the IUD, a little pregnancy-preventing device that’s inserted into the uterus, which was used by 14 percent of partnered women around the world. Much less common were short-term methods, including the birth control pill (9 percent), the male condom (8 percent), and injectibles like Depo-Provera (5 percent). Compare those numbers to the 6 percent of women who used the rhythm method or withdrawal. More The Future Of Birth Control Might Be On Your Phone Surprising as it may be, there’s every reason to celebrate this as good news — long-acting methods like the IUD tend to be more effective because they leave little room for inconsistent use (i.e. missed pills or running out of condoms). There’s also this positive finding: The overall prevalence of contraception has nearly doubled since 1970, from 36 percent to 64 percent in 2015. That is to say: The majority of partnered women around the world now use some form of contraceptive. These numbers are much less encouraging among the least developed countries, where that number drops to just 40 percent. In Africa, it is just 33 percent. At the opposite end of the spectrum is China, which only this year ended its infamous one-child policy, with 84 percent of women using contraception. Close behind is Northern Europe, with 77 percent, and North and South America, with 75 percent each. In the coming decades, those numbers are expected to shoot up.

By 2030, the UN predicts that the number of partnered women using contraception will rise by 20 million to nearly 800 million. But, it’s World Contraceptive Day, which has the stated aim of a world \"where every pregnancy is wanted,\" so we’d be remiss to end on that sunny note. While the situation has certainly dramatically improved, the number of women worldwide who want contraception but don’t have access is actually expected to change relatively very little: from 142 million to 143 million by 2030. That’s thanks to growing contraceptive demand and rising numbers of reproductive-age women in sub-Saharan Africa.

              "  'context': 'Every year, about 42.5 million American adults (or 18.2 percent of the total adult population in the United States) suffers from some mental illness, enduring conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, statistics released Friday reveal. The data, compiled by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), also indicate that approximately 9.3 million adults, or about 4 percent of those Americans ages 18 and up, experience \"serious mental illness\" – that is, their condition impedes day-to-day activities, such as going to work. This data does not diverge greatly from the last SAMHSA report, released in 2012, which found that 45.9 million American adults, 20 percent of this demographic, experienced mental illness at least once annually. (Though there is a 1.8 percent difference, the statistics do have margins of error, and methods of compiling them are often revised, so this dip does not necessarily mean there has been a long-term decline in mental illness.) The SAMHSA paper comes amid increasing scrutiny of the ability of America’s health care system to handle issues of mental illness. For example, the American Mental Health Counselors Association released a study earlier this week claiming that adults with mental illness who live in those states electing against expanding Medicaid under Obamacare will be denied insurance. According to the study, care could be denied to up to 4 million patients. The SAMHSA study breaks down mental illness rates by state. Perhaps surprisingly, New Jersey had the lowest national rates of overall and severe mental illness – 14.7 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively. The states with the most mental illness? In Utah, 22.3 percent of the adult population experienced mental illness, and in West Virginia had the most cases of severe mental illness among adults, at 5.5 percent. It may be tempting to look at the map that accompanies the study and try to make guesses at why, say, the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest seem to suffer more from mental illness than other regions. However, because there is so much mental health illness in all the states – and lots of uncontrolled variables – it would be hard to draw any real conclusions. According to the study, \"factors that potentially contribute to the variation are not well understood and need further study.\" Not all psychiatric statisticians are satisfied with SAMHSA’s findings, with some alleging that the agency grossly understates the prevalence of mental illness. Ronald Kessler, McNeil Family Professor of Health Care at Harvard and expert in large scale mental illness surveys, tells Newsweek that SAMHSA’s assessment of serious mental illness is \"pretty good\" but that he believes that the \"prevalence for any mental illness is too low.\" Kessler, who is familiar with SAMHSA’s computational methods, said that the agency did not measure all of the ailments in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -- including some major ones like attention deficit disorder. \"I find it objectionable that they use this term ‘any mental illness,’\" he says. \"What they really mean is any mental illness that they decided to measure. What they ask about is anxiety and depression and drinking and drugs, but there are many things beside that they totally ignored.\"’ Kessler estimates that the prevalence of mental illness might range from 25 to 30 percent of American adults. A 2011 report published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pegs the number at 25 percent. SAMHSA’s statistics division disagrees with Kessler’s assessment. \"This captures the majority of people suffering from mental illness in the country,\" Dr. Kevin Hennessy, deputy director of the Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, tells Newsweek. According to the report, the state-level estimates are based on data collected from 92,400 adults 18 and over from the 2011 and 2012 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. The survey itself was built around the DSM, but also includes an \"improved prediction model\" developed based on previous survey attempts. Ultimately, the experts might be splitting hairs; even the state with the lowest rate of mental illness still nears 15 percent. Perhaps more importantly, only 62.9 percent of adults nationwide with serious mental illness received mental health treatment in the year they reported this illness. Dr. Peter Delany – director of the \"the government’s lead agency for behavioral health statistics,\" the Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, according to SAMHSA’s website – tells Newsweek that the information shows policymakers, in black and white terms, that mental illness impacts a large portion of the population, regardless of statistical caveats. \"These are real people that have very serious problems,\" he says. \"The data should be helping us think through how we want to approach helping them get services that they need.\" Nearly 1 in 5 Americans Suffers From Mental Illness Each Year',\n",

              "  'context': 'United Airlines is scrambling to respond to intense and far-reaching scrutiny after the airline bumped an unwilling passenger, whom authorities forcibly dragged down the aisle, off the flight on Sunday evening. The incident was recorded by several passengers onboard the internal flight and, as a result, the debacle has sparked a social media backlash which left many wondering: How could this have happened? Airlines overbooking flights is a relatively standard practice and passengers, whether they realize this or not, agree to the policy when purchasing flight tickets. Carriers vary in their processes though generally, an airline will overbook in order to offset the perceived likelihood of no-shows. Federal rules dictate a carrier must first check whether anyone is willing to voluntarily give up their seat before then bumping flyers involuntarily if nobody comes forward. United CEO Oscar Munoz claimed the airline company \"followed established procedures\" when aviation police removed a \"disruptive and belligerent\" passenger from the plane. The airline, owned by United Continental Holdings (NYSE: UAL), said in a statement that the flight had been overbooked. \"Overbooking is a necessity for airlines due to different levels of no show passengers experienced on different routes. It\\'s normally a highly sophisticated process based on extensive detailed statistical analysis,\" John Strickland, an aviation expert and director at JLS Consulting, told CNBC in an email. \"Even when passengers are forcibly denied boarding the idea is to handle this as tactfully & sensitively as possible,\" Strickland added. In the case of the United Express flight 3411 from Chicago to Louisville on Sunday, four crew members were required to board the plane in order to work from Louisville the following day. While it is customary for airlines to negotiate the number of passengers on board a flight, analysts suggested it was unusual such protocol took place after everyone had boarded the plane. Audra Bridges, a witness who posted the video to her Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) page Sunday evening, said United management came on board the flight and used a computer to randomly select four passengers who would then be removed from that trip. The man in the video — one of those four randomly selected — reportedly claimed he was a doctor and needed to see his patients at the hospital in the morning, then proceeded to say he would call his lawyers. Munoz claimed the passenger which had been involuntarily removed from the flight had \"raised his voice and refused to comply\" in an internal letter sent to employees. The letter, which was obtained by CNBC, added, \"(Crew members) were left with no choice but to call Chicago Aviation Security Officers to assist in removing the customer from the flight.\" The U.S. Department of Transportation states that each airline must \"give all passengers who are bumped involuntarily a written statement describing their rights and explaining how the carrier decides who gets on an oversold flight and who doesn\\'t.\" Here\\'s the reason United Airlines can kick you off your flight',\n",

              "  'context': 'Although today’s farmers markets seem more concerned with the authenticity of the heirloom pedigrees of their produce than with feeding the hungry, it wasn’t always that way. The public markets that date back to the early days of the colonies were important both for trade and keeping people fed. More recently, in the birth of the modern farmers market movement more than 40 years ago, antihunger groups played a key role. In the early 1970s, the direct retail sale of fruits and vegetables by farmers was illegal in California, and the first modern farmers markets in the state opened in 1979, after the then-and-again governor, Jerry Brown, signed the Direct Marketing Act, allowing growers to sell directly to consumers. The first market in Southern California opened in the parking lot of a church in Gardena, a diverse city in the South Bay of Los Angeles County. The market was sponsored by the Interfaith Hunger Coalition, part of the Southern California Ecumenical Council, and was intended to bring the blue-collar city fresh, healthy fruits and vegetables at affordable prices. The coalition expanded into four other communities the following year. Spreading widely and wildly throughout California and across the country over the succeeding decades, farmers markets have drifted somewhat from their antihunger roots. As humorist Clare Doody wrote for The Washington Post last year, everyone who shops at the farmers market has \"already done yoga that morning. Yet somehow they didn’t sweat; their topknot still looks good and they’ve got on a great scarf. And don’t get me started on the women.\" Every paragraph of her piece begins \"I don’t like farmers markets because...\" It’s satire, sure, but it hits close to the experience of shopping the Wednesday-morning market in downtown Santa Monica—where no one appears to have a day job, everyone is an actor/model/DJ, and, yes, they just came from yoga. Last week, however, the Los Angeles City Council passed a measure that will reconnect the city’s 57 markets with their antihunger roots—and further advance a national movement to leverage farmers markets to help increase food access for poor Americans. The measure, which received unanimous support, will require that every farmers market in the city accept Electronic Benefits Transfer cards, which are used to redeem food stamp benefits. Last summer, the Los Angeles Food Policy Council, which lobbied for the measure, found that half the city’s markets either didn’t accept EBT or couldn’t be confirmed as accepting it. Vance Corum, who helped open that first market in Gardena, said, \"The decision by the council to require all markets to accept EBT is the most positive thing the city can do\" to provide equal access to farmers markets. \"We lost a lot of poor people who were coming to farmers markets,\" continued Corum, who runs the Washington state–based nonprofit Farmers’ Markets America. \"Now we’ve built them back to some extent, and we’ll continue to see some bright light at the end of the tunnel, where people of all ethnicities, all income levels, will have some form of access.\" The largely white and middle-class local food movement, which spurred the popularity of farmers markets, is not to blame for that loss. Rather, changes to how federal benefits were distributed cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients off from the resource. Between 1994 and 2013, the number of farmers markets nationwide has increased from fewer than 2,000 to 8,144, \"thereby potentially increasing access to farm products for nutrition assistance program participants,\" according to a USDA report. In 1994, just over a quarter of markets accepted food stamps, which were then redeemed with paper vouchers. As the nutrition assistance program switched over to EBT cards in the early 2000s, the ability for cash-based farmers markets to accept food stamps declined sharply, hitting just 8 percent of all markets in 2004. But managers of farmers markets and their vendors have been catching up. As of 2011, more than a third of markets accepted benefits, and the share has continued to increase. The Los Angeles ordinance will further increase that figure. To prevent vendors from spending so they can accept plastic, managers at each market will be required to have an EBT point-of-sale machine (provided for free by the state) that will allow SNAP recipients to debit their cards and receive scrips or tokens representing the equivalent amount of cash. Customers can then spend the scrips with vendors, who can redeem them for cash or another form of payment from the market operators at the end of the day. The scrip can go a lot further at the farmers market than you might imagine. A number of regional price-comparison studies of farmers markets and grocery stores have found that buying direct costs roughly the same, and sometimes even less, than shopping at a supermarket. One study conducted in Vermont found that buying organic items from the farmers market was less expensive in every instance than buying from the store. That’s not to say that some farmers market items aren’t exorbitantly expensive. As Michel Nischan of Wholesome Wave said, \"People will fixate on the $5-a-pound heirloom tomato, but they will not fixate on the 80-cents-a-pound kohlrabi.\" That same tomato might cost a dollar or two a pound when it’s a little past its prime and perfect for making sauce. Nischan’s work at Wholesome Wave is dedicated to making SNAP scrips go twice as far by expanding market-match programs, which incentivize food stamp recipients to shop at farmers markets by matching the amount they spend with an EBT card. Local programs around the country provide such matching funds, and Nischan’s organization was able to get federal funds supporting market-match programs included in the 2014 farm bill. Last year, California received a $3.7 million grant to expand market match in the state. While having an EBT machine at a farmers market can help bring in new customers, those with market-match programs see even larger increases in business. According to Nischan, markets that add a doubling program can see a 38 percent jump in overall sales compared with when they accepted EBT. \"What we’ve seen is that little bit of incentive—it can just be a $5 doubling or a $10 doubling—it changes the way these SNAP consumers spend the rest of their SNAP dollars,\" Nischan said. \"You give these families an extra $10 a week, and they move mountains with it.\" Los Angeles City Councilmember Mitch O’Farrell mentioned the possibility of expanding market-match programs in Los Angeles as a potential step beyond the EBT ordinance. But according to a study released Tuesday on farmers markets in South Los Angeles, the market-match programs available aren’t connecting with residents in parts of the city where food access is the poorest and rates of diet-related disease are the highest. According to a Community Health Councils report, more than 80 percent of nearly 500 consumers surveyed were not aware of market match. Furthermore, there simply are not enough markets serving communities in South Los Angeles, according to Gwendolyn Flynn, CHC’s policy director of nutrition resources development—and the perception remains that not all residents are welcome at those markets that do exist in poor, diverse communities. \"The support of the city council, with their vote, was tremendous in helping to dispel this notion that this was for a few people—no, it’s for everybody,\" she said. Low-income shoppers have felt that \"farmers markets were kind of elitist—and that’s not the case.\" Some organizers see farmers markets as an alternative to the long-flagging efforts to bring grocery stores and other food retailers into neighborhoods that have historically lacked access. But Flynn is hoping for more dynamic, more diverse solutions—not only to the diet-related problems that neighborhoods are facing but to the lack of jobs and economic opportunity as well. \"Having farmers markets shouldn’t preclude us from having supermarkets and grocery stores and community gardens and other forms of urban agriculture,\" she said. But, as Nischan said, \"frankly, from an economic perspective, when you talk about making food access a quick reality, it’s a lot cheaper to open a four-, five-, or six-vendor market\" than to open a grocery store. \"If I were a grocery store owner, I wouldn’t do it either,\" he said, referring to opening a location in a low-income neighborhood. Flynn contends that bringing more food access across the board, from grocery stores that hire hundreds of workers to community gardens that reduce blight and provide opportunities for civic engagement, \"would help to reinvigorate and stimulate these local economies and in the long run would contribute to the health outcomes in communities like South Los Angeles.\" That kind of broad-based neighborhood change, in part driven by farmers markets, has happened before—to a degree. For example, in the early days of the Hollywood Farmers Market, \"Hollywood was a little bit of a rough neighborhood, so we were looking for a social impact related to many things,\" said James Haydu, the executive director of SEE-LA, which operates markets across Los Angeles. Not only did the market sell food to residents and area restaurants, but it used public space, got people out into the street interacting with one another, and helped to support California farmers. Santa Monica was also a far different place in the early 1980s, when its famed downtown market made its debut, from what it is today, with its many post-yoga-class actors.

              "  'context': 'Every summer, we are constantly on the look out for new destinations to explore. Besides, of all the 7,641 Philippine Islands, only a handfull are generally considered as established tourist destinations. This includes the island province of Palawan. After earning the most coveted spot as the \"World Best Island\" for 2 consecutive years, truck loads of tourists have made this their destination of choice, leading to the overnight fame of 3 of its major attractions: Puerto Princesa, El Nido and Coron. However, as how the saying goes \"save the best for last,\" Palawan’s finest set of islands is hidden far away from the bustling crowd of Central and Northern Palawan and is found at the southern tip of this elongated landmass. The Balabac Archipelago is a group of 31 islands found at the very tip of the Palawan Province. It’s a collection of islets, atolls and sand bars, of which Onuk Island is said to be the best, most beautiful, most coveted and yet the most elusive island. To get here, one needs to travel to Rio Tuba town from Puerto Princesa, a good 4-hour drive and another 4 hours by boat going to Balabac town from Rio Tuba. Balabac town is still in its purest and untouched form, therefore, accommodations are very basic. From basic to \"roughing it,\" lodging are available in Balabac town and Punta Sebaring Island. From Balabac town, iHAPer must take another 2.5 hour scenic boat ride before reaching the paradise called Onuk island. The boat ride can be very calm to rough depending on the time of the day and weather, however, one can witness an otherworldly change of water color from dark blue, light blue to crystal clear white as the island gets closer. Once the island is reached a blinding white sandy shore welcomes travellers, while a rustic-looking wharf and cottages on stilts is easily noticeable from the approaching boat. The island of Onuk is blessed with immense beauty. Here, one will find probably the whitest and finest sand, comparable to that of talcum powder; a patch of lush vegetation at the center of the island; nesting sea turtles that come back to the island to lay their eggs; and the healthiest corals, where giant Taclobo clams, Nemo, Dory and other types of fish swim in abundance. To top it all, a view of the mountain range of Sabah, Malaysia is surprisingly visible on the southern horizon of the island. Travel Pointers Accessing the Island is quite tricky, not because of it’s location but because of the permit that any potential visitor has to request for to visit the island. The Island of Onuk is owned by the Mayor of Balabac, Palawan and any request to visit the island must be coordinated with the LGU of Balabac. Based on the experience of the group of travel blogger Chyng Reyes, permits are only issued, a day before the visit, so an alternate plan to visit other islands of Balabac must be in place as a back up. It is also highly suggested to have a reliable boatman since the town is fairly new in catering to incoming visitors. One highly recommended boatman is Kuya Fidel. His rental rate is P3000 per day, good for 6 people. The Finest Beach is Found at the Tail-end of the Philippines',\n",

              "  'context': 'Looking out the window of a plane – with many hours to burn and a god-like perspective of the world – can get you pondering some of life’s big questions: Are we alone in the universe? How did it all begin? Is there purpose to our existence? Wait, what are those little holes in airplane windows? Thanks to the curious mind of Robbie Gonzalez from io9 , the latter of those questions might be answered. After finding no sturdy answer on internet forums, he decided to track down a copy of a maintenance manual for the Boeing 737 on Wikileaks and contact Marlowe Moncur, Director of Technology for GKN Aerospace, the world leader in passenger cabin window design development. As you might have already guessed, it’s to do with regulating pressure. He found that most cabin windows consist of outer, middle and inner panes – all of which are made of a superstrong synthetic resin. Typically, it’s the middle pane that has the mysterious little hole. Only the outer and middle panes are actually structural, while the inner is pretty much there as failsafe and to protect the other layers. Moncur said it’s only there to maintain cabin pressure in the extremely rare event that the outer pane becomes fractured. Cruising at 10,600 meters (35,000 feet), the pressure is around 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) per square inch. This is too low for the human body to stay conscious, so the pressure is artificially maintained at around 3.5 kilograms (8 pounds) per square inch. But of course, if you increase pressure inside, the structure has to be strong to hold the difference between the external pressure and internal pressure. The outer pane is the thickest of these and is the primary layer that bears the pressure of the cabin. According to Gonzalez, the little hole is there to act as \"as a bleed valve, allowing pressure between the air in the passenger cabin and the air between the outer and middle panes to equilibrate.\" Simply put, it ensures that only the strongest outer pane is bearing the pressure, leaving the middle pane available in case of an emergency.

              "  'context': 'Updated Nov. 30, 2013 That awkward moment when people think you and your dad are married. And that\\'s not just rhetorical Internet speak. My parents and I just got back from a cruise to the Bahamas and two people on separate occasions asked me if I was my dad\\'s wife. What\\'s more, a Peruvian ship worker also asked us, \"Is that your daughter? But she looks like a China woman!\" And a presumably respectful Southern gentleman asked me, after seeing me with my parents, if I was \"like a Cambodian victim of sex trafficking?\" That one was really the cherry on top of my Piña Colada. These questions are all particularly anathema to me because I actually write for a living about the global subjugation of women. So I am very certain that I\\'m not my dad\\'s mail-order Asian bride and that my mom is not my sex trafficking captor. My parents, who are 61 years old, white and live in Iowa, adopted me from Seoul, South Korea after I was left on the doorsteps of an orphanage when I was a day old. I\\'m not a unique case -- after the Korean War ended in 1953, many moms in South Korea abandoned their newborns in a society that would ostracize an unwed woman who had a child. There are complex stereotypes regarding race, gender, prejudice, and privilege that arise when people ask us whether we are married -- namely the inculcated archetype regarding the \"creepy\" older white man man and the younger, submissive Asian woman. Society\\'s view on this is simply not something I want to be reminded of when I\\'m hanging out with my dad. I\\'m not saying I\\'m free of my own biases or I adhere to some supreme level of moral rectitude, but since it\\'s National Adoption Awareness Month (granted, it\\'s domestic-focused) and this type of prejudice is not endemic to a cruise ship but rather something that happens to many Asian adoptees, I thought I\\'d make a small request. I think it\\'d be best, guys, if we could stop labeling and perpetuating stereotypes because, well, just look at what happens: awkwardness for everyone involved. My sister-in-law, dad, brother, cutest nephew ever, mom, me. Now, it might seem easy to attribute these statements to the \"type\" of people who go on this \"type\" of vacation. A cruise is, of course, probably about the least authentic way to travel. There is no farm-to-table fare, no architecture steeped in history. The completely curated activities and cheesy over-the-top theatrical tone of a cruise relegates it to steerage in the ranks of traveling. Fine, but it is a fun vacation for families. Plus, I was veritably unable to check email for a week, so I had a great time. But I will say this cruise I went on was not prototypical. On board, we mostly hung out in an unassuming whiskey lounge with dark wood and went to shows and a classy-enough art auction. The cruise left from a port in New York and was a week-long home to an eclectic mix of socioeconomic statuses and races. Old-money-Upper-East-Siders complained about how the food was \"teahrible.\" Russian families three generations strong ate Japanese teppanyaki with precocious daughters looking squarely in their parent\\'s eyes telling them \"Nyet\" (No). Italian women loudly compared their commutes from Staten Island into the city. And a largely Filipino and Peruvian boat crew told me about the new food they ate on the boat -- like spaghetti carbonara. But as I describe these passengers above, it\\'s clear I\\'m just as prone to stereotyping others as anyone else is. And these subtle, nuanced observations can be more insidious than overtly offensive statements such as racial slurs -- which are vivid and salient in their wrongness. These more latent forms of bias can slowly build undetected. Creating awareness and actively trying not to do this takes work. To be sure, this post isn\\'t some culturally elitist screed meant to elicit comments like \"\\'Murica, fu*k yeah.\" This is no uproarious David Foster Wallace piece, \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I\\'ll Never Do Again,\" in which he derisively mocks the low-brow nature of a cruise he took with statements such as, \"I have seen 500 upscale Americans dance the Electric Slide. I have seen sunsets that looked computer-enhanced. I have (very briefly) joined a conga line.\" All of this caused him to basically have an existential crisis. I guess I can be thankful all that didn\\'t happen to me. I am actually pointing out that on this racially diverse boat, people from all over the world projected stereotypes toward Asian women and white men. Ever one to lighten the mood, my hilarious, intelligent mom said, \"Well, what if you and I are an item, and Dad is just the beard?\" But that would simply never happen because that\\'s not a social construct society has formed a consensus on. When I was younger, I wanted to go places strictly with my dad, because he had brown hair and I thought I resembled him more than my strawberry-blonde mom. As a Korean adoptee in a homogenous Midwest community, I thought I blended in more this way. Now, the reality is that the opposite is true. The cruise isn\\'t the first time something like this has happened. A few years ago, I lived with my parents outside of Chicago when I was in grad school for journalism. My dad and I were at some event and I was producing a radio segment, when a local politician -- you know, those public figures in whom we place all our trust -- asked if my dad and I were married. I remember neighbors asking, too. It\\'s just uncomfortable. But beyond being uncomfortable, these questions are also distressing because they bring up issues from childhood that have shaped who you are. It\\'s a reminder of feeling like an outsider and wanting to fit in. And it\\'s a reminder that you probably overcompensate because of it. It\\'s a reminder that growing up and not seeing anyone who looks like you can make you dislike or be disinterested in your own ethnicity. It\\'s a reminder that you realized -- early on in life -- that the world is such an imperfect place that a mother could be forced to give up her child. And that is all personally painful to think about. But it all also probably made you more of a soul-searcher. Nicole Soojung recently wrote for Bitch Magazine about whether race should be discussed among adoptees, pointing out that some parents opt for a \"colorblind\" approach. She said that a mother who adopted a son told her: \"I don\\'t see my son\\'s color. Race is just not an issue for us.\" But race in relation to adoption is an issue, precisely for reasons like what happened on our cruise. And apparently it\\'s not an issue only families of adopted kids should talk about -- it\\'s something everybody should. So big picture, let\\'s try not to uphold prejudices and stereotypes because look what happens -- people ask you if you\\'re married to your dad.

You’d think the most sleep-deprived state in the nation would be somewhere in the sleepless northeast, right? But you’d be wrong. A new study has found that the state with the worst sleep habits in the country is Hawaii. So while Hawaii may make a popular vacation destination for those looking for relax, the people who live there are depriving themselves of sleep, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study. The study examined how many Americans were getting less than the recommended 7 hours of sleep per night, and found alarmingly that a third of Americans aren’t getting that amount of rest, based on a poll of 400,000 adults in all 50 states. Hawaii scored the worst at 56.1 percent. The best? South Dakota at 71.6 percent. Geographically, the Great Plains states tended to score the best, as well as states along the Appalachian Mountains. However, southern states also performed poorly along with Hawaii, such as Alabama and Georgia. And don’t think that the people who work hard every day are the ones deprived of sleep. It’s actually people who are unable to work or who are unemployed who get the least amount of sleep.

              "  'context': 'Like Kobe beef and halibut sushi, much of what you see labeled as jamon iberico is not what you think it is. Though the narrative of acorn-fattened pigs roaming the woodlands of western Spain is popular, it appears to be a misleading one: Most ibe1rico pigs spend their short, unremarkable lives slopping up provender on factory farms. Since the price and quality of jamon iberico vary widely—high-end examples can fetch more than $200 a pound—Spain’s Ministry of Agriculture rolled out designations a few years back that minimize the guesswork. White, green, and red tags denote pork that’s typically mixed-breed and frequently fed with grain, not acorns. Purebred, acorn-fed iberico pigs are tagged with black labels. Outside the Iberian Peninsula, where shoppers are less conversant in Spanish ham-speak, the color-coded tags will likely prove useful. Roughly 20,000 tons of the black-hoofed hams were exported last year alone, up 25 percent from the year before. Eighty percent of exported iberico goes to EU countries such as Germany, Italy, Portugal, and France. Japan, the U.S., and Mexico make up the majority of the remaining 20 percent.  But there is a movement in the U.S. to develop its own American versions of the world\\'s most exclusive cured meat. Acornseekers, based in Flatonia, Texas, was the first to bring Iberico pigs, a breed indigenous to Spain and Portugal, to the U.S. for commercial production. La Quercia, an Iowa-based farm that sells its pork to high-end shops such as Eataly and Murray\\'s in New York, has its own \"acorn proscuitto,\" made from nut-foraging Missouri Tamworth pigs. And on Feb. 5, Georgia-based  White Oak Pastures held a dinner to celebrate its first harvest—featuring its pigs flown in from the dehesa savannas in southwest Spain—and included chefs from Spain who led the preparations. Compared with conventional hogs, the indigenous Iberian species matures far more slowly, bears smaller litters, yields less meat, and requires vast swaths of acorn-rich pastureland (the Spanish government mandates at least five acres per animal). Which is why, according to the Asociacion Nacional de Industria de Carne de España, the largest association representing the Spanish meat industry, 95 percent of jamon labeled as iberico is actually mixed-breed. And why authentic jamon iberico is so much pricier. With that in mind, here are five questions to ask before your next jamon purchase if you’re seeking quality over price, whether traditional Spanish or the newest American offerings:  Breed: Was the pig pure-breed or mixed? Diet: Was it fed wild acorns or industrial fodder? Lifestyle: Was it free-range or farmed? Curing: Was it three years (the minimum for pure-breed iberico) or 700 days (the minimum for cross-breed)? Lifespan: Did the pig enjoy one or two years of grazing? If the latter, it leads to a more complex final product. Avelino Garcia, a bespectacled charcutero who’s been carving ham in Madrid’s Pacifico market since 1970, said his customers spring for the acorn-fed stuff on holidays and special occasions only, for the most part. \"Sure, we’ve come a long way since the dime-a-dozen chorizo sandwiches of the Franco era, but jamon iberico will always be a luxury product.\" Corrects second-to-last paragraph about the curing process Five Questions to Ask About Jamón Ibérico',\n",

[Donald Trump seems to connect President Obama to Orlando shooting] The idea that people in positions of power or influence are conspiring to conceal sinister truths from the public can be inherently appealing, because it helps make sense of tragedy and satisfies the human need for certainty and order. Yet politicians hoping to take advantage of these tendencies must rely on vague and suggestive statements, since any specific accusation could be easily disproved. \"He\\'s leaving it to the audience to piece together what he\\'s saying,\" said Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami, in a recent interview. Trump\\'s rhetoric has fit this pattern, particularly his repetition of the phrase, \"There\\'s something going on.\" He said the same thing with reference to the deadly attack in San Bernardino last year at a debate in January. \"There’s something going on there,\" Trump told MSNBC\\'s Morning Joe in November when asked whether Islam is a violent religion. \"There’s something definitely going on.\" Uscinski noted that Trump has used the tactic throughout his campaign to gain support by appealing to voters\\' fears and cynicism. \"The one thing that’s remained absolutely consistent is his penchant for conspiracy theorizing,\" Uscinski said. Polling during the primary showed that Trump was especially popular with Republicans who endorsed conspiracy theories. [The outlandish conspiracy theories many of Donald Trump\\'s supporters believe] His supporters were more likely than supporters of Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich to agree with the statement, \"President Obama is hiding important information about his background and early life,\" according to the data from Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey. The poll found also found that Trump\\'s supporters were more likely to believe that vaccines cause autism, that global warming is a hoax and that Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton intentionally did not act to prevent the deaths of Americans in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.

              "  'context': 'Every Kickstarter project wants to meet its fundraising goal. But a new study suggests that raising a ton of money doesn\\'t predict how much success a crowdfunding project will ultimately find.  Researchers at North Carolina State University found that the number of people who supported a project on Kickstarter — rather than how much money the project raked in — was the real indicator of whether a product would succeed.  The study, published this month in the journal Research Policy, followed 1,000 successful Kickstarter campaigns in technology, product design, hardware and video games. All participants who responded raised at least $10,000 from an average of 1,078 backers.  SEE ALSO: 3.5 million people supported Kickstarter projects in 2016 \"The first key finding was that the amount of money a crowdfunding entrepreneur raised was inconsequential to their product’s ultimate success in the market,\" lead researcher Michael Stanko said in a statement.  For one, raising a lot more money didn\\'t make founders any more likely to meet their goals for sales or profit once they entered the marketplace. That was because the difference in funding wasn\\'t enough to help founders spend more on advertising or do anything else that would actually translate into more sales. Beyond that, raising extra money indicated that founders started to lose focus and stop innovating on bigger ideas. Faced with the pressure of a massively successful Kickstarter campaign, founders started to get slightly overwhelmed.  SEE ALSO: Vegans, this plant-based leather wallet is made just for you The only factor that actually indicated how successful a product would be when it moved beyond Kickstarter?

              "  'context': 'Do you wish your job offered more opportunities to travel, but also had more to do with a giant potato? Maybe a job driving the Big Idaho Potato Truck is the career you’ve been looking for. The promotional vehicle, which consists of a semi cab hauling a 12-foot-tall replica potato, travels around the United States to draw attention to the prize spuds of Idaho. Operated by the Idaho Potato Commission, the truck is currently on its fifth annual tour of the country. Funding concerns mean this could be the last year, but a recent, unexpected endorsement from Kobe Bryant—he name-dropped the truck in an ESPN interview—may have helped secure its future. To find out what life on the road with the Big Potato is really like we spoke with Larry Bathe, who is not only the current driver of the trailer, but has been with the project since the very beginning. The Big Idaho Potato Truck first hit the road in 2012, as a promotional tour commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Idaho Potato Commission. As Bathe told us, the idea for the truck came from Linda Kaufman of marketing company Foerstel Design, who was inspired by an old novelty postcard that showed an impossibly massive potato on the back of a flatbed. Bathe, a lifelong truck driver, was brought in to help figure out exactly how to create and pilot a giant potato around the country. Originally, the huge tater was set to be 16 feet tall, and hold a museum inside, but at that scale it wouldn’t have fit under most bridges. The potato creators scaled the tater back to its current 12-foot-tall size, and began to test drive it, which is when Bathe first took the wheel. The truck did its first nine-month tour in 2012, mostly visiting grocery stores to hand out information on Idaho spuds. That was supposed to be the extent of its service celebrating the Potato Commission’s anniversary, but the vehicle proved so popular that it was allowed to hit the road again in 2013. More and more venues began requesting that the truck make an appearance, from Nascar events to the Kentucky Derby. After the Big Idaho Potato Truck’s second tour it had gained so much notice that the program was given a three-year contract, 2016 being its final guaranteed year. \"Some people love it in the commission, and some people don’t, or at least they act like they don’t,\" says Bathe. \"But in the end we win them over pretty easily.\" Despite yearly funding worries, the Big Idaho Potato Truck continues chugging along. Having turned down the first two tours to be with his family, Bathe returned to the truck tour in 2014. He has driven the potato every year since. According to Bathe, driving around with the heavy carb load is both challenging and rewarding. The potato is 12 feet wide and 28 feet long, making it nearly impossible to see what’s directly behind it. \"It’s difficult for mirrors to see behind it, so I don’t have an idea of the traffic pattern [behind the truck],\" says Bathe. Turning the huge tater is also a challenge, that Bathe nearly always has to navigate by instinct and experience. But the driver of the Big Idaho Potato Truck is not alone. There are also two other \"ambassadors\" on board who look after the logistics of the tour. In addition to the responsibility to interact with the public that each of the potato team shares, one of the ambassadors takes care of photography, video, and other documentation, while the other looks after social media and managing the venues and locations. It takes a team to drive a six-ton potato. All three of the team ride in the cab while they are on the road, but the Big Potato itself isn’t empty. \"You can’t have something that can’t be inspected inside, be as big as that potato,\" says Bathe. To allow for this, there is a door in the potato that leads to the hollow insides which have been fitted with shelves and lockers for the potato team to store their stuff. Even with the close quarters and the challenges of driving a giant potato around, Bathe loves his gig. \"The amount of people that wave at you every day when you’re driving the Big Idaho Potato is just outrageous,\" he says. \"I get thumbs up, waves, people taking pictures. It’s just a feel-good job.\" Since each year could possibly be the last for the truck, its overseers have ended up filling the positions last minute. But Bathe hopes that this will change as the popularity of the Big Potato Truck grows, along with its crew. Oscar Mayer’s promotional, giant-hot-dog-shaped Wienermobile is 80 years old, Bathe points out. The Big Potato \"is just five years old. It’s just getting going.\" How To Drive A Six-Ton Potato Without Causing A Five-Car Mashup',\n",

They are dangerous because the injections are given into the vein that goes into the lungs and people have died. So there is an immediate danger to it, but then there is a long-term danger.

              "  'context': 'Seven years ago a study made headlines for finding that men with older brothers are more likely to be gay. Today the study has resurfaced as researchers extend upon the original findings by looking deeper into the possible biological basis of homosexuality. Published in New Scientist magazine, the 2006 study was conducted by sexologist Anthony Bogaert, a Community Health Sciences chair and professor at Ontario\\'s Brock University. His research led him to conclude that having more older brothers makes it more likely a man will be gay. Each older brother raises the odds of homosexuality by a third, potentially going from a 3 percent chance with the first son to a 6 percent chance with the fourth. Bogaert studied 944 gay and straight men, including some who were raised with non-biological male siblings, to pit prenatal against postnatal factors. His research, which reappeared in a Sept. 4 New Scientist article, ultimately determined that fraternal birth order seems to have a connection to sexual orientation. \"That means for each male gestation that occurs, something changes in a woman’s body that makes her more likely to give birth to a gay son,\" as Brock University explains Bogaert\\'s findings. An abstract from the study, published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, summarizes the research: Only biological older brothers, and not any other sibling characteristic, including nonbiological older brothers, predicted men’s sexual orientation, regardless of the amount of time reared with these siblings. These results strongly suggest a prenatal origin to the fraternal birth-order effect. Today, Bogaert is looking to determine that prenatal origin. \"[The 2006 study] was an important study and it does suggest there is probably a biological basis to the older brother effect,\" he told The Huffington Post during a phone conversation from Canada Thursday afternoon. \"It\\'s an important study in the context of sex orientation development. We have additional research going on right now testing specifically the underlying biological effect of the older brother. ... There are no results yet. We are collecting samples of mothers of gay men and comparing them to mothers of heterosexual men and looking to see if there is evidence of a biological factor that differs between the two groups.\" Bogaert explained that the 2006 study never determined a specific \"mechanism\" -- a biological factor or process -- behind the older brother effect. He suggested this mechanism could be a maternal immune response, a hormone change in the womb, a gestational factor during pregnancy or even genes. \"The 2006 study really strongly suggests that there is biological mechanism but it never really tested the specific mechanism itself in terms of determining what factor is in fact influencing a change in a mother\\'s development during pregnancy,\" he explained to HuffPost. \"What we\\'re doing now is we\\'re looking at the specific mechanism and seeing if we can find evidence for that. We have a study looking at ... mothers of gay and heterosexual men and seeing if there is a maternal immune response. So, that\\'s something very unique and new.\" Bogaert says that isolating the exact biological mechanism or process will support the \"nature\" side of the Nature v. Nurture debate. If successful, his new research could provide a biological backing for homosexuality. \"I think there\\'s strong evidence that people who believe that there\\'s a biological basis to sexual orientation tend to be more tolerant to sexual minorities, and that\\'s one of the more positive [possible] social outcomes,\" he said. \"And I am in that camp. I don\\'t believe that homosexuality is a disorder or immoral.\" The overarching purpose of the new study is to delve deeper into the origins of sexuality. Bogaert says he is trying to understand sexual variability, human sexuality and sexual orientation as a piece of the larger puzzle. \"Unerstanding the biological mechanisms may have some social ramifications, and for me that\\'s great if it ends up being positive,\" he added. \"But a larger motivation is just trying to understand sexuality, and understanding sexuality has its own benefits from a scientific perspective.\" Men With Older Brothers More Likely To Be Gay?

              "  'context': 'This post is part of Stress-Less Parenting Club\\'s latest workshop. Our leader Carla Naumburg is showing us how we can make our family life calmer and happier through mindful parenting. I will never forget the first time I tried to meditate. I was sitting on a hard floor in a stinky gymnasium, hoping to score an easy PE credit so I could graduate from college. A tall, thin man dressed all in white with a long, wispy beard instructed us to cross our legs, close our eyes, breathe deeply and clear our minds. I was able to cross my legs, but it all went downhill from there. Clear my mind? What the hell did that mean? Every time I tried to clear my mind, I realized I was just thinking about clearing my mind, which clearly isn’t the same thing. I tried thinking about black. I visualized black. But then I thought about how black isn’t my favorite color; I prefer blue but I can’t decide between sapphire or turquoise... and the next thing I knew, my mind was anything but clear. Also, my butt hurt from sitting on a hard floor, my nose itched, and I wasn’t sure if I should scratch it. I didn’t try meditation again for almost 20 years. Fast forward to parenthood. You know my story: I was yelling too much and I wanted to find a way to stay calm through the chaos of tantrums and whining and kids not listening. I did not want to meditate. But I was desperate, and everything I read about how to be kinder and less reactive pointed to meditation. Against my better judgment (at the time), I signed up for a mindfulness-based stress reduction course. Here is what I learned about meditation: 1. You don’t have to sit cross-legged on the floor to meditate. You can sit in a chair or on a meditation cushion or bench -- or you can lie down or walk. You can be comfortable. 2. You don’t have to close your eyes. 3. You don’t have to clear your mind. Far from it. 4. Meditation isn’t about staying perfectly focused on your breath or a candle or a mantra. It’s about noticing when your mind has strayed and coming back, over and over again. Even seasoned meditators have a hard time staying focused. 5. How you feel during your meditation session is not an indication of how successful or unsuccessful it was. How you feel after you meditate is much more important. I try to meditate for about 20 minutes at a time, several times a week. Please note, I said try. It doesn’t happen every day for me, and it certainly doesn’t have to happen every day for you. But meditation is dose dependent, meaning the more you do it, the more you will experience its benefits, such as decreased stress and reactivity (i.e. you’ll be less likely to explode at your kids), improved sleep and better moods. So, if you’re ready to give it a shot, here’s what you need to do: Sit down and breathe. Here’s how: Find a comfortable sitting position, either on a chair or on a cushion. If you’re in a chair, sit with both feet on the floor. You can also lie down, and if you find yourself falling asleep, enjoy the nap. Next time, try keeping your eyes open. Take a few deep breaths to start, and then let your breathing steady out to however your body wants to breathe. You don’t have to breathe slowly or deeply, just breathe normally. Pay attention to your breath, either at your nostrils or at your belly. You can say quietly \"in, out, in, out\" with each breath, or you can count your breaths, and when you get to 10, start again at one. When your mind wanders, as it will after about three seconds, just gently go back to your breathing. Try not to get frustrated with yourself; your mind is just doing what it is used to doing -- thinking! Just notice your thoughts, whatever they are, let them go, and go back to your breath. And then do it again, and again. If 20 minutes seems like a long time, try 10. Or two. Any amount of time is better than none. You can use a kitchen timer, a digital watch or any one of the apps listed below to help you. THIS WEEK\\'S CHALLENGE 1. Keep going with the challenges from the previous weeks: try to notice when you’re physically but not mentally present with your children, and find times each day to practice mindfulness. 2.

As she grew older, Iosco, her mother’s long-term boyfriend, was always there for her. He acted like the best father that anyone could ever ask for. He supported her, loved her, and treated her exactly as he treats his own biological daughters. Maybe that was because he didn’t feel like he was acting like a father. He really did consider Lauren to be his very own child. Every family is different, and we all go through different obstacles. Lauren’s biological father may not have been there for her while she grew up, but she, by no means, grew up without a dad in her life. At 18 years old, Hernandez graduated high school. At her graduation party, she knew exactly what gift she wanted. Iosco had no idea what was coming. When Hernandez handed him a gift, he was a bit thrown off. He thought this was supposed to be her party! Inside, he found a beautiful poem. He thought that was it, and he was already getting emotional. Then, he sees that there is another envelope hidden at the very bottom of the gift box... official adoption papers.

Now, a promotional email from the company has ripped the lid off Valve’s plans for 2016. This year’s Steam summer sale will get underway on June 23, as per an email distributed to PayPal account holders over the past week. \"Now you know when it’s going to happen,\" reads the accompanying message \"you can get ready for the savings.\" While in previous years PayPal has let the cat out of the bag without Valve’s say-so, it seems that the company was given the go-ahead this time around. The email makes reference to the exclusive nature of the reveal, and a tweet promoting the announcement tagged the official Steam account, according to a report from Tech Spot. This news seems to confirm previous reports that the 2016 summer sale would run from June 23 to July 4. In May, a developer using the handle MrFreemanBBQ posted a screenshot of communication from Valve referencing those dates — along with a message warning recipients to keep this \"confidential\" information secret — to the Steam subreddit. Digital downloads have long been at the core of the Steam platform and its summer sales, but this year we might see Valve push its hardware with some deep discounts. Recent sales figures for the Steam Controller suggest that both the peripheral and the company’s Steam Machines are struggling to find an audience. However, the summer sale isn’t just about price cuts — Valve often adds an extra element to draw consumers in, like the monster game that was rolled out in support of last year’s iteration.

While many situations are complex, there\\'s one profoundly simple truth that men need to know: Women leave men they love. They feel terrible about it. It tears their heart out. But they do it. They rally their courage and their resources and they leave. Women leave men with whom they have children, homes and lives. Women leave for many reasons, but there\\'s one reason in particular that haunts me, one that I want men to understand: Women leave because their man is not present. He\\'s working, golfing, gaming, watching TV, fishing ... the list is long. These aren\\'t bad men. They\\'re good men. They\\'re good fathers. They support their family. They\\'re nice, likeable. But they take their wife for granted. They\\'re not present. Women in my office tell me, \"Someone could come and sweep me off my feet, right out from under my husband.\" Sometimes the realization scares them. Sometimes it makes them cry. Men, I\\'m not saying this is right or wrong. I\\'m telling you what I see. You can get as angry, hurt or indignant as you want. Your wife is not your property. She does not owe you her soul. You earn it. Day by day, moment after moment. You win her over first and foremost with your presence, your aliveness. She needs to feel it. She wants to talk to you about what matters to her and to feel that you\\'re listening to her. Not nodding politely. Not placating. Definitely not playing devil\\'s advocate. She wants you to feel her. She doesn\\'t want absent-minded groping or quick sex. She wants to feel your passion. Can you feel your passion? Can you show her? Not just your passion for her or for sex; your passion for being alive. Do you have it? It\\'s the most attractive thing you possess. If you\\'ve lost it, what\\'s the reason? Where did it go? Find out. Find it. If you never discovered it, you are living on borrowed time. If you think you\\'re present with your wife, try listening to her. Does your mind wander? Notice. When you look at her, how deeply do you see her? Look again, look deeper. Meet her gaze and keep it for longer than usual, longer than what\\'s comfortable. If she asks what you\\'re doing, tell her, \"I\\'m looking into you. I want to see you deeply. I\\'m curious about who you are. After all these years I still want to know who you are, every day.\" But only say it if you mean it, if you know it\\'s true. Touch her with your full attention. Before you put your hand on her, notice the sensation in your hand. Notice what happens the moment you make contact. What happens in your body? What do you feel? Notice the most subtle sensations and emotions. (This is sometimes described as mindfulness.) Tell her everything you\\'re noticing, moment after moment. But you\\'re busy. You don\\'t have time for all this. How about five minutes? Five minutes a day. Will you commit to that? I\\'m not talking about extravagant dinners or date nights (although these are fine, too). I\\'m talking about five minutes a day to be completely present with the woman you share your life with. To be completely open -- listening and seeing without judgment. Will you do that? I bet once you start, once you get a taste, you won\\'t want to stop. (Note: The gender dynamic outlined above is reversible. It can go both ways.) ......

Among one of Angelou\\'s notable policy stances was her opposition to standardized testing and President Barack Obama\\'s Race to the Top competition, as the Washington Post pointed out this week. We are alarmed at the negative impact of excessive school testing mandates, including your Administration’s own initiatives, on children’s love of reading and literature. Recent policy changes by your Administration have not lowered the stakes. On the contrary, requirements to evaluate teachers based on student test scores impose more standardized exams and crowd out exploration. Angelou was among 120 authors and illustrators who co-signed a letter to Obama in October 2013, criticizing his administration\\'s education initiatives for placing too much emphasis on standardized testing. In the letter, organized by The National Center for Fair and Open Testing, the authors wrote Launched in 2009, the Race to the Top competition allows districts and states to compete for federal funding in exchange for implementing certain education initiatives, such as adopting higher standards or building new teacher evaluation systems. As the Washington Post notes, Angelou further spoke out against the initiative on MSNBC\\'s \"Andrea Mitchell Reports.\" \"Race To The Top feels to be more like a contest,\" Angelou said, \"... not what did you learn, but how much can you memorize.\" As CBS points out, Angelou and Obama had a somewhat up-and-down relationship.

              "  'context': 'Most hikers would hightail it upon spotting two snakes fighting on a path. Arkansas hiker Dawn Kelly decided to record the snakes on her smartphone instead, creating the kind of video most of us would rather watch from a safe distance. The unusual thing about this snake battle royale, however, isn\\'t that Kelly managed to record it unscathed, but that the two snakes, a copperhead and a cottonmouth, shouldn\\'t have been fighting at all. According to Alabama Auburn University herpetologist David Steen, male snakes often fight in something called a \"combat dance\" over female snakes. But until now, no one has recorded evidence of two different species of male snakes fighting, according to the BBC. When snakes wrestle, it\\'s not to the death but to overpower the weaker snake and eventually mate with the female snake waiting for the winner nearby. But if the female snake is of a different species, this sort of a sparring match seems like a wasted effort since snakes can only mate with their own kind. The video shows the two male snakes battling, and there\\'s no female snake or snakes captured in the footage. So it\\'s ultimately unclear whether the male snakes were indeed fighting to impress female snakes off camera. Another herpetologist, Professor Phil Senter of Fayetteville State University in North Carolina, told the BBC the tangle could have been about territory and not a mating ritual at all. \"It could have just been a border dispute,\" Senter said. One thing both herpetologists can agree on: two different snake species fighting is extremely rare. \"I\\'ve never seen that before, two different species fighting each other as if they\\'re the same species,\" Senter said. One possible explanation is that thanks to reptile breeders who have been known to artificially hybridize these two snake species into \"cottonheads\" or \"coppermouths,\" this might also happen without human intervention in the wild. It could also be a case of mistaken identity, especially since copperheads and cottonmouths are members of the same animal genus, Agkistrodon. \"Snakes are dumb,\" Senter said. \"Their brains are very, very small. At least, the thinking part of it is.\" Either way, the video is an interesting view of male snake combat dance maneuvers. Hiker\\'s dramatic video of two snakes fighting reveals rare sight',\n",

              "  'context': 'There’s an effort afoot to change the the way people perceive high-tech versions of old-fashioned food—and it’s happening far outside the laboratory. For years, food technology companies have referred to their products as \"cultured\" or \"lab-grown,\" but as these new businesses start to make a first foray into the public eye, they are also pushing ideas that may make people uncomfortable—such as meat grown in labs. To get over that, there’s a push to coalesce around a new term: \"clean food.\" \"It’s important because words matter in how we describe how something makes a big difference,\" said Paul Shapiro, a top leader at Humane Society of the United States and author of a forthcoming book on the subject. \"You can only make a first impression once.\" By opting for this terminology, the industry hopes to better communicate to people the ethos behind their products, rather than the actual processes (which often do occur in a laboratory) used to deliver them to the kitchen table. It’s main selling point: \"clean\" meat and dairy are efficient products with fewer sustainability and animal-welfare problems than traditional meat and dairy. The effort—piggybacking off the now-ubiquitous use of the term \"clean energy\"—is being spearheaded by the Good Food Institute, the newly-established, non-profit trade group in Washington, DC. To better make its case, the Good Food Institute is preparing to highlight research by Brian Wansink, a formed US Department of Agriculture official who studied ways to get kids in US schools to eat more vegetables: Research suggests the biggest influence on a person’s opinion of a particular food is how they \"expect\" it will taste. Giving fun, enticing names to healthy foods increases the desire to try them. Why not call broccoli \"broccoli bites\" or carrots \"X-ray vision carrots?\" Renaming foods to make them sound more appealing resulted in an increase in the sale of vegetables in the school cafeteria by 27%. The move comes as these high-tech foods are starting to appear before consumers. Impossible Foods unveiled its plant-based burger at Momofuku Nishi in New York City in late-July, and Beyond Meat is selling its version of a similar product in a limited number of US supermarkets. Memphis Meats is perfecting its product and Perfect Day, the vegan milk company, is looking to launch its first yogurt product in 2017. These are some of the first players in what some hope will be a \"clean food\" revolution. To lure people put off by the freakiness of lab-made meat, this is what the industry wants to call it',\n",

              "  'context': 'A big-budget film arriving in U.S. theaters this weekend has been absolutely savaged by movie critics but still has a ray of hope after setting box-office records overseas in one of the world\\'s biggest movie markets. The reviews have been scathing for Warcraft , the video-game adaptation from Legendary Entertainment and Universal Pictures that cost a reported $160 million to make. But, Warcraft has already managed to pull in more than $120 million internationally, according to Box Office Mojo, even amid incredibly low expectations for the movie\\'s domestic release on Friday. Warcraft made a respectable $75 million in its first few weeks of a limited international release before opening in China on Wednesday (with midnight screenings starting Tuesday night) to record-setting box-office sales in the country that is expected to surpass the U.S. as the world\\'s largest movie market sometime next year. The movie surged to a $46 million Chinese opening on Wednesday, setting a first-day box office record for a non-weekend release in the country while also breaking a record set last year by Furious 7 for its opening day sales in IMAX theaters, with $5.3 million, Deadline reports . Those blockbuster numbers come despite the fact that critics have lambasted the movie, with various reviews describing it as anywhere from \"rather tacky\" to \"unwatchable\" , to the tune of just a 23% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes . Variety notes that Warcraft \\'s stellar start in China could pave the way for the movie to make as much as $150 million in that country, where the game the movie is based on—Blizzard Entertainment\\'s World of Warcraft —is especially popular , boasting a large chunk of the game\\'s millions of fans. That would be a huge boost to the studios behind Warcraft , which many of those same analysts are predicting will only make around $25 million in the U.S. this weekend. Comcast\\'s ( cmcsa ) Universal is distributing Warcraft in most countries, but Legendary Entertainment is partnering with a group of Chinese distributors in that country. Earlier this year, Legendary was sold for $3.5 billion to China\\'s Dalian Wanda, which is expanding its presence in the global movie market and is also the world\\'s largest cinema chain operator. Warcraft opens across North America this weekend, facing off against The Conjuring 2 and Now You See Me 2 to lead a crowded slate of new releases that will also compete against high-profile holders such as X-Men: Apocalypse and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows .

If you're an entrepreneur or small business owner, it's hard not to, but all that extra time in the workplace isn't necessarily a good thing. After a certain point, it can be counterproductive and even hazardous to your health, so it's imperative to know when to say no to more hours. What the research says. Various organizations and independent researchers have looked at the physical, mental, emotional, and social effects of working beyond the standard 40 hours a week. Notable findings include the following: Working more than 10 hours a day is associated with a 60 percent jump in risk of cardiovascular issues. 10 percent of those working 50 to 60 hours report relationship problems; the rate increases to 30 percent for those working more than 60 hours. Working more than 40 hours a week is associated with increased alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as unhealthy weight gain in men and depression in women. Little productive work occurs after 50 hours per week. In companies with normal overtime, only 23 percent had absentee rates above 9 percent. In companies with high overtime, 54 percent had absentee rates above 9 percent. Individuals working 11 hours or more of overtime have an increased depression risk. Injury rates increase as work hours increase. Those who work 60 hours per week have a 23 percent higher injury hazard rate. In companies with an 8.7 percent overtime rate, researchers found no fatigue-related problems. When the overtime rate was 12.4 percent, however, fatigue-related problems were minor. By the time the overtime rate hit 15.4 percent, fatigue-related problems were severe. In manufacturing industries, a 10 percent increase in overtime yields a 2.4 percent decrease in productivity. In white collar jobs, productivity declines by as much as 25 percent when workers put in 60 hours or more. Many of the problems identified above tie to stress, which connect to hormonal balances. Specifically, stress raises cortisol, which can disrupt sleep, appetite, blood pressure, immune system function, memory/cognition, mood, and more. A general guideline for your wellbeing. The available research shows that most workers in the U.S. already are working close to the point where problems can start to occur. Despite how pervasive the managerial idea still is that working employees harder always translates to a better bottom line, science says that your company isn't going to gain much, if anything, if you put in much more than an extra hour or two a day.

There might be a sort of idyllic image of farm involved somewhere, but by and large, the reality of how food – especially meat, dairy, eggs, and fish – gets to the table is shrouded in mystery. Awareness of the type of facilities where animals are raised is increasing, as more consumers actively seek out labels like \"pasture-raised\" and \"cage-free\" thinking they are in some way superior. But in the case of fish, things are a little less clear. In recent years, wild caught and farm raised has become a distinction between various types of fish found in the grocery store, but can most frequently be seen attached to salmon. The average American consumes two pounds of salmon a year, around two-thirds of which comes from farmed sources in China, Norway, and Canada. While wild-caught is largely self-explanatory, what exactly does farm raised mean in the context of fish, mainly salmon? Floating Pig Farms Around 40 percent of all fish consumed annually, are raised on aquafarms which can either be land-based or ocean-based. Land-based farms raise thousands of fish in ponds, pools or even concrete tanks, where ocean-based aquafarms house fish in isolated cages either off-shore or in the open water. In both cases, fish are overstocked and have little space to swim or display their natural behaviors, creating an extremely stressful environment. Around 40 percent of aquafarmed fish will die before they are harvested. And with good reason. Stocking thousands of fish in a small amount of space and feeding them protein pellets (ironically made from other fish) doused with antibiotics and chemicals, such as PCB, understandably makes for highly polluted water. If you’ve ever had a fish and seen what it looks like when you forget to clean their tanks for a few weeks ... you can start to fathom the idea.

              "  'context': 'This mystery tissue could be what\\'s making you feel stiff, creaky...and baffled. By Corrie Pikul You\\'re Achy, You\\'re Sore, and You Have No Idea Why It feels like muscle pain, but unlike a tight hamstring that makes you yelp when you stand up, your ache isn\\'t triggered by a particular movement, and you can feel it in different places at various times. The culprit could be your fascia (pronounced \"fash-ya\"), says Mary Ann Wilmarth, DPT, chief of physical therapy at Harvard University Health Services. This sheet of tissue, made up of densely packed protein fibers, weaves throughout the entire body, and it binds and supports your muscles, bones and even your organs. While bodywork specialists have been passionate about fascia for decades, Wilmarth says it took new research on how fascia and muscles work together (some of it presented at the first international fascia research conference at Harvard in 2007) to get different health pros -- from orthopedists to MDs and pain experts to personal trainers -- to catch on. How Fascia Makes You Feel You have six times as many sensory neurons loaded in your fasciae as in any other tissue of your body except for your skin, explains Jill Miller, a fitness expert and longtime fascia evangelist (she\\'s an experienced registered yoga teacher, has presented case studies at fascia research conferences and developed the Roll Model fascia therapy program). This internal webbing helps different muscle systems communicate with one another -- they\\'re what make you want to get out of your office chair and stretch or roll your neck around. Ideally, your fascias should be supple enough to slide, glide, twist and bind like long, thin sheets of rubber. When they\\'re not functioning properly, signals from the nerve endings are muffled or muted (so you don\\'t feel comfortable in your own body) or they\\'re interpreted by your brain as pain and discomfort. Find Your Inner Feline You know how your muscles feel cramped and stiff when you wake up in the morning? After a night\\'s sleep (or another long period of inactivity, like a car trip or plane ride), the parts of your fascia that wrap around and through your muscle fibers, which are normally stretchy and flexible, can stick together like previously chewed Hubba Bubba. The fix: The best way to release the fascia is to slowly and luxuriously stretch out your arms and legs and roll slowly from side to side before getting out of bed. This will gently pull the muscles apart and separate the connecting tissue, Wilmarth says. To get at the fascia in your calves, ankles and arches, sit on the edge of the bed and flex and point your feet before putting the pressure of your weight on them. Roll It Out Like Bread Dough Fascia can be finicky: It gets stiff and sticky when you don\\'t move around enough, but it can also get bound up and twisted when you move too much or do repetitive motion or injure yourself through activity, says James L. Thornton, the president of the National Athletic Trainers Association. The fix: Work out overused sore spots with a foam roller. You\\'ve probably seen people at the gym using these things, which look like pool noodles, to stretch their back, hamstrings and the notoriously tight IT band on the outside of the hips (this video from Jeff Richter, a certified strength and conditioning coach at St. Vincent Sports Performance in Indianapolis, provides a good foam-roller tutorial). Thornton says to go slowly, and when you get to a sore spot that feels like a bruise, pause for 15 to 20 seconds. The discomfort should melt away as the fascia softens and the muscles release. If you feel intense pain that doesn\\'t dissipate, Thornton says to stop and consider making an appointment with a physical therapist. At home, you can give yourself a massage with tennis balls or Yoga Tune Up balls, which grip the skin to help loosen up individual layers of fascia. Also try a device called the Stick. It lets you really go deep into your calves, shins and hamstrings, but because it\\'s more rigid than a foam roller, the Stick can feel much more intense (think deep-tissue massage versus regular rubdown). Stretch It Out You\\'ve heard that before exercising, it\\'s a good idea to do some dynamic stretching that includes swinging your legs and arms to improve your range of motion. This not only benefits your muscles, says Thornton, but it\\'s also a great way to loosen up your fascia. When your muscles stay tight, the fascia clings to them, and both can become rigid over time. The fix: Take a brisk walk or jog lightly in place, and do some sports-specific moves (for example, leg swings for runners, or shoulder rolls for swimmers). Or try the lazy woman\\'s warm-up: Start your workout, and stay at a slow, easy, I could-do-this-for-hours pace for about 5 minutes. Don\\'t Let the Tissues Get \"Crunchy\" If you\\'ve ever had a shoulder rub and heard something that sounded like crinkling plastic under your skin, that wasn\\'t your imagination -- it was probably your parched, stiffened fascia, says Ruth Werner, a past president of the Massage Therapy Foundation, who spent decades teaching anatomy and physiology to other therapists. The collagen fibers that make up fascia need to stay supple to work properly, and to slide over and under muscles and other inner-body surfaces. The fix: One way to keep the fascia hydrated is obvious: drink lots of fluids, says Werner. Another easy (but easily forgettable) way is to make sure you stand up, stretch and flex regularly throughout the day to keep the fascia from locking up. Werner says some research has also shown that rubbing tight areas -- as when you get a massage -- can boost circulation and warm the fascia, changing the texture to make it even more pliable. Let the Pros Handle It Because fascia is so interconnected, snags -- or adhesions, as pros call them -- in one area can affect other other areas. \"Imagine putting on multiple layers of long-sleeve shirts, and then think about how tugging on one of them would cause all of the other shirts to pull and stretch as well,\" says Cynthia Ribeiro, the president of the American Massage Therapy Association and a massage therapist. She stresses that you can\\'t have healthy muscles without well-cared-for fascia. The fix: There are different therapeutic methods to address keeping the fascia healthy, from intense, sometimes-excruciating Rolfing to gentle fascial unwinding to myofascial release, which usually involves loading the deeper tissues with force until they start to give. If you\\'re chronically stiff and sore, or you have a muscle injury that just won\\'t heal, consult a specialist to see what would be right for you. Massage therapists like Ribeiro and PTs like Wilmarth have seen clients for whom nothing seemed to work...until a type of fascial therapy helped melt away their pain and stiffness.

              "  'context': 'Find out which grocery items have skyrocketed in price lately (plus, a surprising food that has dropped). Price Up: Bacon  Experts began predicting that prices would zoom up last year after droughts affected feed crops, and then a new virus affecting pigs migrated to the U.S. this summer, further lowering supply of this high-demand meat. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average cost per pound of bacon has gone up 56 percent in 10 years (from $3.14 to $4.92) — compare that to beef steaks, which are up 41 percent in 10 years. In U.S. cities, the climb has been even steeper. Over the last 12 months alone, the average price of a pound of bacon in urban areas rose 22 percent to $5.62 per pound, up from $4.61 a year earlier. But if you use bacon as an accent instead of a main course, you’ll get the salty, smoky flavor without spending as much. This stew recipe calls for just two slices. Price Up: Chocolate  News that will give chocolate lovers pause: Not only is demand up for chocolate (thanks to seemingly endless reports of its health benefits) but supply is down, thanks to a shortage of cocoa beans in West Africa (the source for the majority of the world’s beans). The result? Chocolate prices have soared to $12.25 per kilo (that’s about 2 1/4 pounds) — up 45 percent from 2007, says The Wall Street Journal. Cocoa butter prices are rising, too (that’s what gives chocolate its melt-in-your-mouth texture), which means it’s costing manufacturers more to make their product. A slightly more expensive bar may still be worth it, though (here’s a scientific reason why you should indulge, even — or especially — when you’re stressed out). Price Up: Chicken  Surveys show 94 percent of us eat chicken, and nearly four in 10 consumers say they increased their consumption of this healthy choice from 2011 to 2012. But the price of chicken — particularly boneless breasts — has risen more than many other groceries in the past six months, finds a recent survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation. That particular cut has risen 61 cents per pound, to $3.93. Bill Roenigk, chief economist for the National Chicken Council, says high corn (i.e., chicken feed) prices are partly to blame, as well as steady demand because of breast meat’s low fat and calorie content. You’ll spend less if you opt for leg meat, though Roenigk says dark meat tends to be cheaper than white, and isn’t much different, calorie-wise: about 58 calories per ounce for dark, versus 47 for white (and some experts believe it’s healthier for your heart). Price Up: Wild-Caught Fish  Wild-caught fish could be on its way to becoming a special treat: The global fish-price index of the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) hit a record high earlier this year, a result of increased demand and a surge in oil prices (which has a big impact on the cost of operating fishing boats and transporting the catch). Fish that is wild (not farmed) has seen the sharpest price hike, nearly doubling between 1990 and 2012, whereas the index for farmed fish rose by only a fifth (here’s why). Some of the best eco- (and wallet-) friendly options are farm-raised striped bass or farm-raised rainbow trout, which sell for about $8 a pound and have relatively light impact on the environment. That’s significantly lower than wild-caught fish that offer a similar taste and texture, such as cod (which ranges from $14 to $25 a pound) or halibut ($24 a pound). Price Down: Honeycrisp Apples  The \"designer\" apple known as honeycrisp is sweet, juicy, snappy — and (historically, anyway) pricey, costing as much as $4.50 a pound while in-season Cortlands went for $1.50 a pound. Whether because of the catchy name or the truly sweet taste, demand has jumped in recent years, and, until recently, supply couldn’t keep up, since apple trees take five or so years to begin producing fruit in enough quantities to sell commercially. (This fascinating article explains more.) Finally, though, all those honeycrisp trees are meeting demand, and the USDA’s National Fruit and Vegetable Retail report says the variety is actually now going for 14 percent less per pound than it was last year. 4 Foods That Are More Expensive Than Ever',\n",

              "  'context': 'Jimmy John\\'s, the \"freaky fast\" sandwich staple of America\\'s college towns, is being sued by two former employees for what they describe as \"systematic wage theft\" at the fast food chain. In their lawsuit filed Friday in federal court, Karolis Kubelskas and Emily Brunner claim that they were forced to regularly work off the clock because of unreasonably low payroll budgets provided to individual Jimmy John\\'s stores, leading to minimum wage and overtime violations. Jimmy John\\'s has \"intentionally and repeatedly misrepresented the true time worked by their hourly employees\" in order to keep costs down and dodge overtime laws, the complaint alleges. The lawsuit is a proposed class action, with Kubelskas and Brunner arguing that such pay practices come from \"corporate set policies\" and would apply to other workers. Jimmy John\\'s did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Kubelskas and Brunner, Jimmy John\\'s workers aren\\'t given enough time to complete all their closing duties at the end of the day, at which point managers clock them out regardless of whether or not they continue to work. The practice is exacerbated, they claim, by a company policy that bases managers\\' bonuses largely on whether or not they hit their targets on labor costs. The system, they say, \"has the practical effect of creating widespread wage theft.\" Brunner, who\\'s represented by the Chicago firm Foote, Mielke, Chavez & O’Neil, originally filed suit against the company in July, but she filed an additional, joint complaint with Kubelskas last week. Both suits name JS Fort Group, which they describe as a franchisee, as a defendant alongside Jimmy John\\'s Enterprises. Founded in Illinois in 1983, Jimmy John\\'s has built its foundation on the \"irreverent attitude and dirt-cheap prices\" championed by its founder, Jimmy John Liautaud, according to the company\\'s website. The sandwich chain now has more than 1,900 locations throughout the U.S., and it was often highlighted as an entrepreneurial success story by failed GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney on the 2012 campaign trail. Of Jimmy John\\'s employees, the company\\'s site says, \"They don\\'t mind doing whatever it takes to get the job done. Their hustle is part of how they live their daily lives, and they enjoy the fruits of a hard-earned entrepreneurial lifestyle.\" The proposed class action isn\\'t the first time Jimmy John\\'s has been the target of a lawsuit from workers. Last November, 300 delivery drivers sued a major Jimmy John\\'s franchise operator, claiming that the auto expenses they were forced to bear pushed their earnings below the minimum wage. In 2011, a group of 10 Jimmy John\\'s locations became the target of a heated labor organizing campaign by the Industrial Workers of the World, who\\'d launched a then-rare bid to unionize fast food workers. The union narrowly lost the election, and six workers later claimed they were fired due to their union support. In 2012, an administrative law judge sided with the workers.

That question occurs again and again in science fiction, perhaps most notably in The Matrix, a film in which unreality is so pristine that no one notices the truth. That we are all actually, truly living in such a matrix seems laughable until you consider the advances made by video games in the last few decades. Not long ago, all we had was pong: two rectangles and a circle. Today we have virtual reality consoles which are edging toward an experience indistinguishable from reality, or at least what we think of as reality. Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX cofounder, was recently asked this question: Is it possible that the world as we know it is just a simulation made by someone else? His response is perhaps startling, saying that the chances of this reality being a \"base\" reality are \"one in billions.\" To make matters even more confusing, humans are increasingly turning to virtual reality devices to escape this \"reality.\" Thorsten Wiedemann, for example, spent forty-eight hours wearing his Oculus Rift device, proving it is possible to live within a virtual reality at least for a short time. When we asked Bill Nye the Science Guy if he thinks we are living in a computer-generated simulation, he turned to some basic scientific principles to justify his answer. Science ultimately demands testable, repeatable hypotheses to proceed, but how do you test whether we are living in a computer simulation or not? There just doesn\\'t seem to be a way. There is every possibility that this is a hyper-real version of The Sims, and we wouldn’t know. If we had never seen the outside world, there’s no reason we would know it exists, that we’re missing it. So if we as a people had only ever existed in this hyper real video game, we wouldn’t know it was all just a game. That is why it is \"unknowable,\" according to Bill Nye. If we were in a video game, human minds would not be able to detect the outside world until \"something goes wrong,\" i.e. a glitch in the matrix. Still, Nye wishes luck to anyone wanting to design such an experiment. It might take some time, but perhaps could be done... Bill Nye: Is Reality Just a Computer Simulation?

Arya Stark, As for the remaining clan — Sansa Stark Bran Stark , and (until Sunday) Rickon Stark — things finally got so bad that it was time for things to get better. While we haven’t seen Bran in a few episodes, we have seen Sansa, Arya, and of course, Jon. You might have missed the fact that these three siblings (/half-siblings) have something major in common — and not just blood. Over the last season, they’ve all completely shed their former identity. At the end of \"Oathbreaker,\" \"No One,\" and most recently, \"The Battle of the Bastards,\" Jon, Arya, and Sansa have all made life-altering choice, and then walked away from it. Jon, gave up his position on the wall, and walked away. jon More Arya, gave up her life as a Faceless Man, and walked away. arya More Sansa, gave up the shambles of her life with Ramsay, and killed him, and then walked away. sasa More The Stark Kids: not taking your shit anymore since whatever year it is in Westeros. three More Might Bran be the next to suddenly abandon everything he knows and start anew?

Earlier this month the company Facebook wants to stop this from happening, and it’s turning to artificial intelligence to help. Earlier this month the company announced that it was tweaking its algorithms to cut down on \"clickbait\"—the ubiquitous plague of Internet content that over-promises and under-delivers. But it’s a big Internet out there, and plenty of other companies and sites that could benefit from tools that can separate quality news stories from fluff. Now Facebook is open sourcing software to help filter out all that Internet noise.

Another FastText tactic breaks down words into \" subwords \"—such as prefixes, suffixes and root words—to help computers more easily learn their meanings. Beyond clickbait, Facebook suggests software developers could use FastText to help filter out spam. It could power search engines and autocomplete fields. Recommendation engines like the ones used by the likes of Amazon or Netflix could also benefit from a little artificial smarts that can get a better read on what you’re writing. That may seem like an odd trend, given that each of these companies hopes to best the other with better tech, including AI. But artificial intelligence is still a budding field. The researchers creating these technologies within companies like Facebook and Google benefit from having their counterparts on the outside review their work and suggest changes. In a sense, open sourcing code offers the same potential benefit that publishing research in peer-reviewed journals does for scientists. In other words, Facebook is betting that giving away its AI tech will make for better software, because it too can benefit from the new ways others use it. And besides, more developers and researchers learning to use the software means more coders better prepared to work for Facebook in the future.

It gets blamed for infidelity and divorce. Oh the Terrible Societal Pressure of Monogamy! the naysayers tut tut. It\\'s so very difficult, they sigh, as if monogamy was some high-maintence diva demanding the right sort of mineral water. It\\'s just impossible to meet the ridiculous expectations of monogamy! Poor monogamy. Some find it freakish. \"We did not evolve to be monogamous,\" the critics cry, pointing to hedonistic bonobos and walruses, the Hugh Heffners of the animal kingdom. Don\\'t you want to be one of the fun animals? Who\\'s left with monogamy? Wolves and swans, that\\'s who -- pretty creatures known for their savagery and aggression. Monogamy, I\\'m sorry you\\'ve gotten a bad name. For what it\\'s worth, I think you\\'re cool. Hurrah for the faithful! Three cheers for the same ol\\' same ol\\'! I know it\\'s easy to dismiss me, a happily married, squidgy, middle-aged woman. Oh god, you would like monogamy. You probably have dial up. What other dorktacular, old school things do you enjoy? LP records and butter churning? Maybe you think my husband is pussy-whipped because he\\'s faithful. If you do, please tell him that to his face -- he\\'s a pick-up truck driving, \"law and order liberal,\" Texas trial lawyer who owns a gun. I had one of the other kinds of husbands once, the unfaithful kind, and I much prefer this one, thank you. Clearly, I lack the sophistication and edginess to be polyamorous. If you\\'re polyamorous, I wish you all the best. Please enjoy your swingers parties in your shag-carpeted, sunken living rooms. Negotiate your open marriages, use protection, and rock on with your bad selves. I just have one request -- quit beating up on monogamy. Monogamy is not the problem. Let me introduce the real villain, the culprit behind infidelity and divorce -- entitlement. Yes, entitlement, otherwise known as narcissism, selfishness, or \"I need a few months living alone in Spain to find myself.\" Entitlement has unfairly framed monogamy for infidelity for quite some time and I\\'d like to set the record straight. 1. Cheating is about the thrill of being dishonest. To \"cheat\" you need an agreement to renege on, namely monogamy. There\\'s no frisson of danger in openness, no illicit sexual high to chase. A recent study \"The Cheater\\'s High: The Unexpected Affective Benefits of Unethical Behavior\" by researchers at the University of Washington, the London Business School, Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania show that cheaters feel happier after cheating. Why? They feel superior, more clever than the people they just chumped. Screwing around feels awesome, so long as you\\'re short on empathy. You know who\\'s empathy challenged? Narcissists. There is a power dynamic inherent in infidelity. The cheater wants all the perks of a committed partner, and the excitement of messing around on the side. The secrecy is about gaining advantage. You commit all your resources and I\\'ll just feign reciprocity. Cheaters don\\'t want a level playing field. It\\'s about control and entitlement. Cheaters give themselves permission to cheat, because they deem themselves more deserving than the chumpy people who play by the rules. (Rules the cheater agreed to, of course.) 2. If polyamory is \"natural,\" so is heartbreak. If we\\'ve \"evolved\" to screw around, well, we\\'re also wired to be jealous and suffer heartache when we are abandoned. Where\\'s all the talk of how unnatural it is to bond with other people? Gee, we should really stop doing that. This whole trust thing is really overrated. Murderous impulses are also human, and felt very keenly after one\\'s been betrayed. When the cuckolded husband clubs his wife\\'s lover with a baseball bat, they can each claim they \"evolved\" to be this way -- one to screw around indiscriminately, the other to react in a murderous rage. Let\\'s see how those arguments go over in the court of law. We didn\\'t evolve to do a lot of things -- farm, use indoor plumbing, wear lederhosen. Your Darwinian urges are no excuse for behaving unethically. Can we put this tired argument to rest already? 3. Monogamy is not difficult -- honest conversations are. You\\'re not good at monogamy? Stay single or find a polyamorous arrangement. Things not working out in the marriage? Speak up and make it work or get out honestly. Unless yours was a shotgun wedding, no one forces you to commit. Lost in the \"monogamy is so hard\" argument is personal choice. Don\\'t agree to be someone you aren\\'t. Oh boo hoo, the pressure. Your parents want grandchildren and your girlfriend is obsessed with Say Yes to the Dress. Find your backbone, son. Don\\'t be a farce registered at Macy\\'s. And if you agreed to this monogamy thing and changed your mind? You\\'re not doing anyone any favors by unilaterally deciding to betray them. Let them go live an authentic life without you.

He also received 87 applause breaks, according to Knoller. 10:22 p.m. AL QAEDA FAILS TO GET A MENTION — in a State of the Union for the first time since 2001, POLITICO has confirmed. 10:22 p.m. OBAMA MAKES HISTORY — The president is the first in U.S. history to use the words \"transgender\" or \"bisexual\" in a State of the Union address, POLITICO has confirmed. 10:21 p.m. YOUR THOUGHTS, MITT? True to form, the President in his State of the Union speech is more interested in politics than in leadership #sotu https://t.co/DTKQVy03Ck — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) January 21, 2015 10:10 p.m. POTUS IS DONE. Almost exactly an hour-long speech, though we will try to get an exact count. 10:10 p.m. ECHOES OF 2008 — The president borrows a rhetorical tool he used in his 2008 nominating acceptance speech — finding middle ground on contentious issues. 2008: \"We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.\" 2014: \"We still may not agree on a woman’s right to choose, but surely we can agree it’s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows.\" 10:09 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 8 — What he said: \"I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states, that we are the United States of America.\" What he meant: \"I’m almost done here.\" Obama spent most of the speech trying to prove he’s not a lame duck — and, in fact, sounded energized and eager for battle against Republicans in his final two years. But the reappearance of the \"red states and blue states\" line from his 2004 Democratic convention speech — the line that may have aged the least well from the speech that launched his national political career — showed that he’s not above a little nostalgia, and a return to the optimism of the old days, as he prepares to wrap up his presidency. 10:08 p.m. OBAMA AD-LIBS AGAIN — After Republicans derisively cheer when Obama says he doesn’t have any more elections to run, Obama ad-libs: \"I know because I won both of them.\" 10:00 p.m. OBAMA’S LEGACY MOMENT — In a somewhat amazing moment of self-awareness about his legacy and political career, the president invokes his famous 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address in acknowledging his difficulty — as well as his continuing hope — to unite the country. \"How ironic, [pundits] say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It’s held up as proof not just of my own flaws — of which there are many — but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and naïve ... But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long.\" 9:54 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 7 — What he said: \"One year doesn’t make a trend, but this does – 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.\" What he meant: \"I’m looking at you, James Inhofe.\" The new chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, a vocal skeptic of climate change, has vowed to block the Obama administration’s carbon dioxide emissions rule and other new environmental regulations. Obama is signaling that he’ll fight back — if nothing else, to convince Democrats that he’s still on the case and hasn’t given up on climate change. 9:51 p.m. THREE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ABSENT — Just two-thirds of the Supreme Court is present at the State of the Union address, Time reports. Conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Antonin Scalia are not in the House chamber for the president’s speech. Scalia hasn’t gone for more than a decade, while Thomas has decried the event as \"so partisan.\" In 2010, after Obama criticized the court’s Citizens United decision, cameras caught Alito mouthing \"not true.\" 9:48 p.m. OBAMA ON CUBA — \"When what you’re doing doesn’t work for fifty years, it’s time to try something new. ... And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.\" 9:46 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 6: OBAMA CALLS FOR AUMF AGAINST ISIL — What he said: \"Tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.\" What he meant: \"Step up, McCain.\" Obama is taking plenty of heat from Republican critics like John McCain, his former 2008 rival, and Lindsey Graham for not taking tough enough actions to stop the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terrorist group. He’s also faced skepticism from other lawmakers, including Democrats, who say they can’t get consistent answers on what the administration’s goals are. So by asking Congress to give him formal authorization for military action, he’s basically trying to force his critics to share ownership of the issue and spell out what kinds of military actions they’re willing to support — including whether they would back the possible use of ground troops. 9:44 p.m. PARIS ATTACK TALK: Lawmakers, including Rep. Gwen Moore of Oklahoma, hold up yellow pencils when Obama brings up the attack in Paris. 9:42 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 5 — What he said: \"Look, I’m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype.\" What he meant: \"I hear you, Rosa DeLauro.\" The speech made clear that Obama will try to get Congress to approve fast-track trade authority — one of the few areas where he and congressional Republicans actually share the same interests. But he has to nod to the concerns of liberal Democrats — including DeLauro, a House Democrat from Connecticut who opposes the trade deals the administration is brokering — that the agreements won’t include enough environmental and labor protections. The bottom line, Obama said, is that \"95 percent of the world’s customers live outside our borders, and we can’t close ourselves off from those opportunities.\" 9:39 p.m. THE ISSUE OBAMA AND CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS AGREE ON — First time Rs give Obama a standing ovation and Dems don\\'t - 33 minutes into speech, calling for Trade Promotion Authority — Manu Raju (@mkraju) January 21, 2015 9:37 p.m. OBAMA ON KEYSTONE — \"So let’s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.\" David Nather, on what he meant: \"You’re not getting Keystone.\" Obama has already threatened to veto legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline, infuriating Republicans who have put its approval at the top of their energy agenda. Rather than touch off that fight again, Obama opted for the \"let’s set our sights higher\" construction — but there’s no mystery about the signal he’s trying to send. 9:34 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 4 — What he said: \"Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.\" What he meant: \"Seriously, Tennessee is a red state and they’re doing this.\" Obama wants to make the most out of the fact that his community college proposal — which would make the first two years tuition-free for many students — is modeled on a program launched by Republican Gov. Bill Haslam. But other Republicans, including Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, say they don’t want to expand it into a federal program; they’d rather let the states make their own choices. 9:33 p.m. RBG ASLEEP — POLITICO’s Manu Raju reports that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, seated in the House chamber, is asleep. 9:29 p.m. BIG DEM APPLAUSE LINE: MINIMUM WAGE — A big play to the Democratic base with this appeal on the minimum wage. \"And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it,\" he said, to a standing ovation and hoots from Democrats. \"If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.\" 9:28 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 3 — What he said: \"So I’ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let’s put it to a vote right here in Washington.\" What he meant: \"Maybe the states will listen to me.\" White House advisers know there’s not a big chance that a Republican Congress will pass his agenda, but they believe there will be chances to prod states into action — and paid leave is one of the issues where they think they can shape the debate. And if congressional Republicans vote against issues like paid leave, the advisers believe, they’re just hurting themselves. — David Nather 9:23 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 2 — What he said: \"So the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don’t get in the way.\" What he meant: \"Did I mention I’m at 50 percent?\" Obama is basking in the best run of economic news he’s had in a long time, all of which have boosted his approval rating to the highest level since spring 2013, according to the latest ABC News-Washington Post poll. His message to Republicans: Don’t assume the public hates my economic ideas – including my latest package of tax hikes on the wealthy — as much as you do. 9:22 p.m. OBAMA AD LIB — Twelve minutes in, and this reporter thinks Obama appears to be in a confident mood. It’s all over his face. After a laundry list of ways that the U.S. has improved under his watch — job creation, lowered fuel costs, better education results — Obama moves away from his prepared remarks for a moment. \"This is good news, people!\" he says to laughter, offering a wink and a smile. 9:16 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 1, courtesy of the great David Nather — What he said: \"Tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.\" What he meant: \"Tonight, I want to talk about 2016.\" Obama has already promised Democrats he’s going to \"play offense\" against Republicans over the next two years, vetoing legislation and fighting against efforts to dismantle his agenda. It’s all part of an effort Democratic political strategists believe will be necessary heading into the 2016 elections: frame the big policy choices against the GOP — and set up the fights that will carry into Hillary Clinton’s likely campaign for the White House. 9:14 p.m. ‘THE STATE OF THE UNION IS STRONG’ — \"The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong,\" the president says. \"At this moment — with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production — we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.\" 9:11 p.m. OBAMA HAILS ‘BREAKTHROUGH YEAR FOR AMERICA’ — \"Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999,\" the president says, to big applause in the chamber. 9:10 p.m. POTUS TAKES THE PODIUM — After shaking hands with Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner, the Republican leader introduces the president. Obama begins his speech and we are officially underway. 9:06 p.m. POTUS ENTERS THE CHAMBER — President Barack Obama entered the chamber wearing a dark suit and gray tie. Walking behind him are congressional leaders House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Handshake and pat on the arm for Secretary of State John Kerry and a big hug for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 9:04 p.m. POTUS not yet in the chamber. 9:01 p.m. IDLE CHATTER — As lawmakers wait for the president, video catches conversations between: — Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel — Democratic Reps. Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington, D.C. and Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri — Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Al Franken of Minnesota (sharing a laugh) 8:56 p.m. MINIMAL MIXED SEATING — Some Democrats and Republicans are seated next to each other, but not many, POLITICO’s Manu Raju reports. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is sitting next to Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is seated in between Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.), and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is in between Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) 8:50 p.m. #SOTU UP TO 452 TWEETS PER MINUTE — Wow. 8:45 p.m. ERNST’S CAMO SHOES — POLITICO congressional reporter Seung Min Kim plays fashion reporter for a night and gets a shot of the camouflage shoes of Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who is delivering the official Republican response this evening. Ernst is the first female combat veteran ever elected to the Senate. Tonight\\'s choice of shoes for Sen.

POLITICO’s Burgess Everett reported earlier this afternoon that the Nevada Democrat was unlikely to attend the speech. Reid returned to his Senate office today for the first time following injuries he sustained while exercising earlier this month, including fractured ribs and bones in his face. 8:35 p.m. SITTING COURTSIDE — Members of Congress often vie for the aisle seats in the House chamber, within speaking and handshake distance when the president enters. According to POLITICO’s Jake Sherman, here’s a partial list of lawmakers who snagged a prized aisle seat: Reps. Billy Long of Missouri, Rep. Barbara Lee of California, Mark Takano of California, Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas and, of course, Eliot Engel of New York. 8:30 p.m. KING CLARIFIES ‘DEPORTABLE’ COMMENT — Rep. Steve King tried to make a joke out of the comment he made about a guest invited to the State of the Union by President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. \"The futility of language emerges on Twitter,\" the Iowa Republican said. He then tried to channel pop star Taylor Swift, telling reporters to \"Shake it off.\" When pressed further, King blamed Obama and said the controversy would have no impact on the Iowa Freedom Summit, his 2016 presidential hopeful gathering in Des Moines this weekend. \"Why isn’t the president taking heat for what he’s doing to the rule of law?\" asked an unrepentant King. \"He’s going to make another promise that he’s going to violate the Constitution tonight. At least one.\" King, perhaps Congress’ fiercest and most outspoken critic on immigration, harshly criticized the president and first lady on Twitter for inviting a DREAM-er to sit in the first lady’s box. — John Bresnahan 8:25 p.m. PHOTO: MARTHA RADDATZ AND PAUL RYAN — The ABC News correspondent and Wisconsin Republican share a photo years after Raddatz’s moderation of 2012 vice-presidential debate between Ryan and Joe Biden.

Long time since that debate! pic.twitter.com/FTg1GXpDPX — Martha Raddatz (@MarthaRaddatz) January 21, 2015 8:03 p.m. SUBMITTED WITHOUT COMMENT — *Crossing fingers* President Obama\\'s suiting up for the big speech. Watch at 9pm ET → http://t.co/NKU3ndKHOu #YesWeTan pic.twitter.com/l7EJZYVk9s — The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 21, 2015 7:55 p.m. YOUR DESIGNATED SURVIVOR: ANTHONY FOXX — Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx won’t be attending tonight’s State of the Union address and is instead acting as the government’s \"designated survivor,\" according to a report. The White House selected Foxx as the cabinet member who won’t appear at the speech in case a catastrophic event befalls the nation’s legislative and executive branches, according to USA Today. Foxx, normally 13th in line for the presidency, would assume the nation’s highest office and provide continuity of government if such a tragedy struck. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz was last year’s designated survivor. — Kevin Robillard 7:50 p.m. #SOTU: MORE THAN A TWEET PER SECOND — A couple hours before the speech, there were about 80-130 tweets per minute using the official #SOTU hashtag, according to POLITICO’s Andrea Bitely. 7:40 p.m. 2016 GOVERNORS WEIGH IN — Capitol Hill and President Barack Obama are in the spotlight tonight, but at least two GOP presidential hopefuls don’t want to be left out. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker — two governors weighing running for the Republican nomination in 2016 — took to Twitter to criticize Obama ahead of his speech. \"I’ll save you 45 mins. Obama will decry Republicans, beat up on private business and argue for more ‘free stuff’. Your welcome,\" Jindal wrote. (While his timing estimate is pretty close to our reported 50-minute estimate, he might have been better served by going with \"You’re.\") Walker also took a shot at the president on Twitter. \"President seems to measure success by how many people are dependent on the govt,\" he wrote. \"We should measure success by just the opposite.\" 7:35 p.m. PHOTO: ALAN AND JUDY GROSS — Alan Gross, the USAID subcontractor who was reunited with his family last month after being imprisoned in Cuba for five years, appears in a pre-SOTU photo with his wife Judy. Alan and Judy Gross are ready for the #SOTU.

In a video released hours before Obama’s speech, the Ohio Republican obliquely criticized the president for pursuing big-government policies. \"Tonight isn’t about the president’s legacy,\" Boehner, dressed in a shirt and tie, says in the video, looking straight at the camera. \"It’s about the people’s priorities. Making government bigger isn’t going to help the middle class. More growth and more opportunity will help the middle class, and those are the Republican priorities.\" 7:20 p.m. POLL: 42 PERCENT SAY STATE OF THE NATION IS STRONG — Forty-two percent of Americans believe the U.S. is in good or excellent shape, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released hours before tonight’s speech. That’s compared with 57 percent who say the state of the nation is not so good or poor. Still, the survey offered some good news for the president as he nears his address to the nation. A plurality of Americans — 42 percent — believe his policies have helped the economy, while 27 percent said they slowed economic development. And a quarter of Americans say their financial situation has improved since Obama took office, the best number of his presidency. 7:10 p.m. ERNST EXCERPTS RELEASED — Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) will declare that the new Republican majority in Congress is \"back to work\" for Americans, stressing that the era of \"political talking points\" is over in the official GOP response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union. In excerpts released in advance of Obama’s speech, Ernst will ask to have a \"conversation\" with viewers, pledging that lawmakers in Washington are \"ready to make Washington focus on your concerns again.\" \"We heard the message you sent in November — loud and clear,\" Ernst will say, a reference to the decisive GOP victories last fall. \"And now we’re getting to work to change the direction Washington has been taking our country.\" The message Ernst plans to send on behalf of the Republican Party is a clear attempt to showcase a GOP that is ready to shift the focus away from a gridlocked Washington that Ernst said held the \"same stale mindset\" that led to policies such as Obama’s health care law. Ernst will strike a tone of cooperation between the Obama White House and Republicans who dominate the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, citing trade and tax reform as two potential areas for a bipartisan compromise. To see the full excerpts released for Ernst’s speech, go here. — Seung Min Kim 7:00 p.m. KING RAILS AGAINST FLOTUS SOTU GUEST — Rep. Steve King, perhaps Congress’s fiercest and most outspoken critic on immigration, harshly criticized the president and first lady for inviting a DREAM-er to sit in the first lady’s box. \"Obama perverts ‘prosecutorial discretion’ by inviting a deportable to sit in place of honor at #SOTU w/1st Lady. I should sit with Alito,\" the Iowa Republican wrote on Twitter, in reference to Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, part of the court’s conservative wing. Ana Zamora will sit with first lady Michelle Obama in her box this evening. She moved from Mexico when she was a year old, and has expressed gratitude to the president for his 2012 executive order that has allowed her to stay in the U.S. 6:50 p.m. 42 LAWMAKERS TO PAY TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE HEBDO — Forty-two Democratic lawmakers will pay tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre during tonight’s speech, a spokesman for Rep. Gwen Moore told POLITICO. Moore, a Wisconsin Democrat, planned to lead a group of lawmakers in holding up a yellow pencil during applause breaks when the president mentions the terrorist attacks on the French satirical newspaper. The yellow pencil has become an international symbol for freedom of expression and the press following the attacks. According to Moore spokesman Eric Harris, the lawmakers are: Gwen Moore, Keith Ellison, Barbara Lee, Marcia Fudge, Karen Bass, Charlie Rangel, Janice Hahn, John Conyers, Jim McGovern, Mark Pocan, Joe Courtney, Ruben Gallego, Bobby Rush, Matt Cartwright, Steve Cohen, Bill Foster, Mark Takano, Raul Grijalva, Jackie Speier, Gene Green, Mark DeSaulnier, Rosa DeLauro, Nita Lowey, Doris Matsui, Derek Kilmer, Sander Levin, Eliot Engel, David Cicilline, Loretta Sanchez, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Alan Grayson, Grace Napolitano, Juan Vargas, Donald Payne Jr., Kyrsten Sinema, Alan Lowenthal, Dina Titus, Joaquin Castro, Jim Langevin, Marc Veasey, Chris Van Hollen, John Garamendi, Sam Farr, Debbie Dingell, Michelle Lujan Grisham, Suzan DelBene. Harris added that the list is \"growing by the minute.\" 6:30 p.m. SPEECH EXCERPTS RELEASED — President Barack Obama will use his State of the Union address Tuesday to convey his continued dedication to \"middle-class economics\" and to call for \"a smarter kind of American leadership abroad,\" according to excerpts of his speech provided by the White House. \"The verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don’t get in the way,\" Obama will say. He also will discuss his desire for smart foreign policy around the world and call on Congress to pass a resolution authorizing military action against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. For a link to the full excerpts released by the White House, go here. — Jennifer Epstein 6:20 p.m. CAPITOL POLICE: OBAMA WILL BE DONE BY 9:50 PM —U.S. Capitol Police are telling officers that they anticipate President Barack Obama will finish his State of the Union address by 9:50 p.m., POLITICO’s John Bresnahan reports. A 50-minute speech would be the president’s shortest-ever State of the Union address: As we noted earlier, Mark Knoller of CBS News reported that Obama’s shortest speech to a joint session of Congress lasted one hour. 6:15 p.m. WHAT DOES SOTU MEAN FOR CONGRESS? In a new video, POLITICO senior congressional reporter Manu Raju previews tonight’s speech and what it means for lawmakers on the Hill. 5:45 p.m. SCOTT: OBAMA EMBRACING ‘FAILED’ POLICIES — Add Florida Gov. Rick Scott to the list of Republicans slamming President Barack Obama even before his State of the Union address gets underway. The Republican governor — who narrowly won reelection against Democrat Charlie Crist in one of the nastiest races in the 2014 cycle — took aim at Obama’s proposal that seeks to lower taxes for the middle class while raising the top capital gains rate and closing loopholes for wealthy individuals. \"The massive tax increases proposed by the President reflect his commitment to the failed, liberal policies that were roundly rebuked by the American people in November,\" Scott said in a statement released in advance of tonight’s speech. In recent days and weeks, the White House has changed its tactics by aggressively marketing their policy proposals ahead of the State of the Union, both to generate buzz and gather momentum. Scott’s statement is yet another indication, though, that the policy rollout is also allowing Republicans to go on the attack early, as well. 5:15 p.m. A stunning photo from POLITICO photographer M. Scott Mahaskey of National Statuary Hall beginning to come alive. The hall just outside the House chamber is a major hub for television camera crews every year before the State of the Union address. Statuary Hall takes shape as a multi-crew television studio as crews setup for the #SOTU Jan. 20, 2015 at the US Capitol in Washington, DC. (M. Scott Mahaskey/Politico) ? A photo posted by POLITICO (@politico) on Jan 20, 2015 at 2:00pm PST 5:00 p.m. DON’T YOU HAVE WORK TO DO? — Several members of Congress have already shown up to reserve seats in the Chamber hours ahead of President Barack Obama’s speech — despite an explicit message from House Speaker John Boehner not to do so. \"As has been the practice in the past, members will not be allowed to reserve seats prior to the joint session by placement of placards or personal items,\" the speaker’s office wrote in an email earlier today. \"Chamber Security may remove these items from the seats.\" But some lawmakers — most notably perennial early-arriver Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), who arrived at 8:30 a.m., according to CNN — have already arrived to reserve seats along the aisle to get a fist-bump or quick chat from the president as he enters the chamber. Other lawmakers who have reserved seats, include Reps. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, Marcia Fudge of Ohio, Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Steve Cohen of Tennessee, according to CNN. 4:25 p.m. TEA PARTY LEADER: ‘TWO TEA PARTY RESPONSES’ TONIGHT: The head of the Tea Party Express, the group responsible for the tea party response to the State of the Union, says the conservative movement will have two responses tonight — Curt Clawson ... and Joni Ernst. \"Sen. Ernst earned the support of Tea Party Express in the primary and was able to coalesce tea party members and activists across the state of Iowa because of her message and her values that are representative of the larger tea party movement. ... So, in that vein, I would say there’s going to be two tea party responses,\" Tea Party Express Executive Director Taylor Budowich said in a phone interview with POLITICO. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, of course, will be delivering the official Republican response tonight, while Florida Rep. Curt Clawson of Florida will deliver the tea party one. But Tea Party Express endorsed Ernst when she ran to the right of the field in the 2014 Republican primary, and the new senator has significant support from grassroots conservatives. Budowich dismissed concerns about whether the annual tradition was deepening rifts between the conservative and establishment wings of the GOP, predicting that Clawson and Ernst’s speeches would be \"complementary.\" He argued that a tea party response is still helpful in 2015, even though he estimated that there is 95 percent overlap between the official Republican Party platform and that of the tea party. Tea Party Express has hosted an official tea party response to the State of the Union since 2011. When asked how many more years his organization would feel compelled to offer its own, separate response to the State of the Union, Budowich they plan to stop in 2017 — because the president will be a member of the tea party, naturally. 4:05 p.m. BIDEN TO CALIFORNIA — Vice President Joe Biden will visit southern California later this week, the White House announced today. On Friday, Biden will address West Los Angeles College to discuss higher education. Earlier this month, the White House unveiled a plan to make two years of community college free for all students, a proposal the president will likely discuss this evening. The vice president will also speak at the Patient Safety, Science & Technology Summit in Irvine on Saturday. Other speakers at the summit include former President Bill Clinton, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Reps. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.) 4:00 p.m. REID ANNOUNCES THREE GUESTS — A young woman who benefited from President Barack Obama’s immigration orders will be Harry Reid’s guest at the State of the Union. The Senate minority leader, who is up for reelection next year in Nevada, has invited Blanca Gamez to sit in the balcony during the president’s speech tonight. Reid is counting on historic Hispanic turnout in the southern part of the state to win what could be a very tough campaign. An afternoon release from Reid’s office notes that Gamez was born in Sonora, Mexico, and came to the United States when she was seven months old. Reid’s office said Gamez \"was able to benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that President Obama announced in 2012 ... Now, because of President Obama’s executive actions on immigration in November 2014, Blanca’s mom is able to apply for Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA).\" Gamez is currently applying for law school and working for a local nonprofit called ProgressNow Nevada. — James Hohmann 3:50 p.m. PORTMAN FUNDRAISING OFF SOTU FOR SENATE RUN — Sen. Rob Portman is soliciting donations for his upcoming Senate run by criticizing the president ahead of tonight’s address. The Ohio Republican — who last month announced he would not run for president and would instead seek reelection to the Senate — sent a fundraising email to supporters this afternoon. \"In past State of the Union addresses, the President has repeatedly touted ineffective policies and made promises to the American people that he could not keep,\" Portman writes in the email. \"I don’t know about you, but I am fed up with the failures of the Obama administration and think it’s time we take a stand.\" The email then links to a donation page for his 2016 campaign. The NRCC also sent a fundraising note to supporters earlier in the day based on Obama’s State of the Union address. Portman, who was first elected to the Senate in 2010, co-chaired the NRSC in 2014. 3:45 p.m. LAWMAKERS TO OFFER CHARLIE HEBDO TRIBUTE — Rep. Gwen Moore will lead a group of lawmakers in a tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, her office said today. A spokesman for the Wisconsin Democrat said that the congresswoman — along with other lawmakers — will hold up a yellow pencil during applause breaks when the president mentions the terrorist attacks on the French satirical newspaper. The yellow pencil has become an international symbol for freedom of expression and the press following the attacks. \"The congresswoman believes that this is unique opportunity to join our global partners in showing our collective support and solidarity,\" Moore press secretary Eric Harris said in a statement. Harris noted that Moore, who suffered two broken feet and a broken arm after she fell over the holidays, will be in a wheelchair for the speech. 3:00 p.m. NRCC FUNDRAISING OFF SOTU — The National Republican Congressional Committee is setting a fundraising target for tonight at 9 p.m., the time of the president’s State of the Union address. The NRCC sent out an email this afternoon from Republican strategist and former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove slamming Obama for executive overreach. \"President Obama will double down on his go-it-alone strategy in tonight’s State of the Union address,\" Rove’s email says. The NRCC is hoping to reach its target of 1,000 membership renewals by the time Obama addresses the joint session of Congress tonight. 2:45 p.m. WARREN BACKS OBAMA TAX PLAN — Sen. Elizabeth Warren today offered her support for the White House middle-class tax plan that the president will detail in his speech. The Massachusetts senator, a favorite in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, offered praise on Twitter for the plan that would raise taxes on the wealthy by raising the top capital gains rate and closing certain loopholes. \"The game is rigged when people pay higher taxes working for money than inheriting it,\" she wrote. \"I support @barackobama’s plan.\" Obama’s proposal will face long odds in the Republican-dominated House and Senate. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin have already signaled their objection to the proposal. Warren’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 1:20 p.m. RAND WOULD LIKE A WORD — Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) will offer his own response to the State of the Union on Tuesday night. The all-but-declared presidential candidate will go live with his speech at 10 p.m. Eastern, immediately following the president. Paul also plans to do a hit on Fox News with Megyn Kelly. Paul’s response, which will stream on his YouTube page, will come at the same time as Iowa freshman Sen. Joni Ernst, who is delivering the official Republican response. The Kentuckian has offered several direct video responses to the State of the Union since taking office in 2011, including last year. — James Hohmann 1:20 p.m. RAND WOULD LIKE A WORD — Sen.

In a not-so-subtle bit of symbolism, both the president and some congressional Republicans are bringing guests to highlight their views on the issue. Alan Gross, the USAID subcontractor who was imprisoned for five years in Cuba, will join First lady Michelle Obama in her box tonight, along with his wife, Judy. The White House secured Gross’s release as part of the agreement to normalize relations with Cuba. Republicans who objected to Obama’s Cuba deal last month cheered Gross’s return to the U.S. House Speaker John Boehner will host dissident and activist Jorge Luis García Pérez, who served 17 years as a political prisoner under the Castro regime. Pérez, known as Antúnez, has spoken out against Obama for the deal, which he has said appeases the repressive actions of the Cuban regime. In The Wall Street Journal, a Boehner spokesman said the Ohio Republican’s guests highlight \"victims of the continuing tyranny on Cuba.\" Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American, will host Rosa Maria Paya Acevedo, an activist whose dissident father died in a 2012 car accident that the family believes was orchestrated by the Cuban regime. \"While I disagree with the president’s new Cuba policy, I hope Rosa María Payá’s presence on Tuesday night will at least remind him that her father’s murderers have not been brought to justice, and that the U.S. is now, in fact, sitting at the table with them,\" Rubio said in a statement. Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba, will host Marlene Alejandre Triana, whose father died when his plane was shot down by the Cuban Air Force in 1996. Ros-Lehtinen is holding a joint press conference with fellow Florida Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Carlos Curbelo, as well as Antúnez and his wife, at 4:30 p.m. today to discuss the White House Cuba policy. 12:15 p.m. REID BACK AT IT — Senate Minority Leader is back in his office today, following an injury he sustained last month while exercising. The Nevada Democrat broke bones in his face and four ribs, and told KNPR State of Nevada that he might permanently lose sight in his right eye. Reid’s office circulated a photo of the senator in his office preparing for a meeting with his staff. Back at work. pic.twitter.com/bWAsyv5NyH — Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) January 20, 2015 10:30 a.m. TERRORISM TOPS FACEBOOK SOTU CHATTER — Terrorism dominated the State of the Union conversation on Facebook in the past week, the social media site announced Tuesday. People talked about terrorism twice as much as the next-highest subject in Facebook chatter about the State of the Union from Jan. 11-17. The rest of the top 10 topics: 2) Obamacare; 3) Immigration; 4) Jobs and the Economy; 5) Israel and Palestine; 6) Taxes; 7) Community College Funding; 8) The NSA; 9) ISIS; 10) Paid Sick Leave. Obama will likely address the U.S. military’s air campaign in Syria and Iraq against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant targets, as well as the greater fight against global terrorism following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris earlier this month. 10:15 a.m. DEMPSEY TO MISS SOTU — Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey will not attend tonight’s State of the Union address, the Pentagon announced. He is in Belgium attending NATO meetings. Vice Chairman Adm. Sandy Winnefeld will attend Obama’s speech. 10:10 a.m. ERNST ALL SMILES — Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst doesn’t seem too nervous as she prepares to deliver the Republican response to Obama’s speech, in an image posted on House Speaker John Boehner’s Twitter account. 10:00 a.m. GOP SENATORS RESPOND TO OBAMA COMMUNITY COLLEGE PLAN — Three Republican senators wrote an op-ed today advocating an alternative plan to the White House proposal to make two years of community college free for all students. Sens.

One word comes to mind. Seriously?\" 9:10 a.m. THE SURVIVOR SWEEPSTAKES — Every year, the president designates one Cabinet member to stay behind from the State of the Union address and away from Capitol Hill in case of a catastrophic event. Philip Bump of The Washington Post, using data from the UCSB American Presidency Project, takes a look at the last three decades of survivors. Six Interior and six Agriculture secretaries have stuck behind in the last 30 years, tied for the highest number. Obama has picked his Energy secretary the past two years —Steven Chu in 2013 and Ernest Moniz in 2014. 8:45 a.m. HOW LONG WILL HE TALK? — Several strategists told POLITICO’s Kendall Breitman to expect a relatively short State of the Union address this evening. But CBS News White House correspondent and unofficial White House record-keeper Mark Knoller notes that history indicates Obama’s speech will probably last at least an hour. Correction: Pres Obama\\'s 2nd SOTU Address was his longest: 1 hr 26 mins. His 4th was shortest: 1 hr. Average length: 1 hr 9 mins. — Mark Knoller (@markknoller) January 20, 2015 8:20 a.m. POETRY VS. PROSE — A fascinating nugget from this great Michael S. Schmidt profile of Cody Keenan, the oft-bearded speechwriter who drafted tonight’s speech, centers on the president’s shift in rhetorical style. Schmidt contrasts Keenan with former chief speechwriter Jon Favreau, who wrote for Obama during his first campaign and throughout his first term. While Favreau was responsible for much of Obama’s soaring oratory the earned him significant attention at the beginning of his career, Keenan’s grittier, more blue-collar prose has defined much of the president’s tone in the dog days of his second term. \"Keenan, the president’s chief speechwriter for nearly all of the second term, is a different breed from his predecessor, Jon Favreau, who was known for his ability to write lofty, big-picture speeches about hope and change,\" Schmidt writes. \"Mr. Keenan focuses far more on individual, hard-work stories as parables for what is difficult but still possible in America.\" 8:00 a.m. IN THE FLOTUS BOX — First lady Michelle Obama will be hosting more than 20 guests for the speech this evening, the White House announced yesterday. They include: — Alan Gross, a contractor who spent five years imprisoned in Cuba before the White House secured his release last month as part of the deal between the two countries. — Dr. Pranav Shetty, who oversaw two Ebola treatment units in Liberia in August and will go to Guinea later this week to help fight the disease there. — Larry Merlo, CEO of CVS Health, the first major pharmacy to ban tobacco sales. — Ana Zamora, a DREAMer finishing up her last year of college at Northwood University in Texas. — Catherine Pugh, Maryland Senate majority leader and president-elect of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators. For the full list, go here. 7:30 a.m. DUELING NARRATIVES: WHO’S IN CHARGE? — Good morning from Washington, D.C., where the White House and congressional Republicans are already squaring off over the importance of tonight’s speech. In many ways, the back-and-forth over tonight’s State of the Union address is another battle in the larger turf war between the GOP and the Obama administration following the November midterms. As POLITICO’s Edward-Isaac Dovere reports, the White House is hoping to build on the president’s momentum from the last two months to make a simple point: He’s still very much relevant, even as a lame duck. \"[T]here’s really only one thing Obama is trying to get across: He’s still here,\" Dovere writes. The White House has resisted ceding ground to congressional Republicans since their midterm victory, instead going on the offense with an immigration executive order, normalizing relations with Cuba, a climate deal with China and a middle-class tax plan he will discuss at length tonight. Obama, who seems somewhat liberated following the election, has an approval rating of 50 percent for the first time in about a year and a half, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. But congressional Republicans are already downplaying tonight’s address as \"just another presidential speech,\" John Bresnahan and Manu Raju report: \"They’re giving the president his turn in the spotlight — but that’s about it. They say there’s very little chance it will change their agenda, and on Wednesday they’re getting back to business by pushing the bills they want to,\" they write. Republicans have their own set of priorities — reining in Obama on immigration and Iran, putting a Keystone XL pipeline bill on the president’s desk, taking aim at the Affordable Care Act — that they plan to push aggressively with majorities in both chambers. We’ll continue to monitor this dynamic between the White House and congressional GOP throughout the day and into this evening. State of the Union liveblog: The conversation',\n",

There are a few science-backed reasons for this, but perhaps the most interesting is the theory of \"misattribution of emotions,\" which basically says that we stick whatever emotion we’re feeling to our impressions of the people and events around us. (This also explains why jamming at a great concert might trick you into thinking you’re in love with the average-looking lead singer.)

Of the 16 dudes who crossed a secure wooden bridge, only two ended up calling the woman. However, half of the 18 men who crossed a shaky suspension bridge followed through with a call. ...horror films can actually make you more attractive to the opposite sex. Affectionately called \"the love bridge\" in the psychological community, the study shows it’s easy to associate an adrenaline rush with the same excitement you feel when you’re crushing hard on someone. So basically, anything that gets us amped makes us more physiologically aroused (is this why I’m always so horny on roller coasters?) study from the late 80s explains it differently. Scientists Dolf Zillmann and Norbert Mundorf found that horror films can actually make you more attractive to the opposite sex. Researchers paired male undergrads with female partners and showed them a 14-minute clip from Friday the 13th Part III. The men reported enjoying the film almost twice as much if the female showed distress during the film, while the women said they liked the film more if their male companion acted calm and collected. Men were initially considered unattractive were later judged more appealing if they displayed courage. Science Says This Is The Best Movie To Watch On A Date',\n",

The fast-growing burrito chain has been reluctant to increase menu prices despite higher costs for ingredients such as California avocados and salsa. Executives said they first want to secure ample supplies of natural meats and switch to cooking oil and tortillas that do not contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Chipotle's sales at restaurants open at least 13 months, a closely watched gauge of industry performance, were up 6.2 percent for the latest quarter, more than the average analyst estimate of 4.7 percent compiled by Consensus Metrix. Executives from the Denver-based chain said visits to its restaurants increased when its animated film and arcade-style game about sustainable food production went viral on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Chipotle was the first major U.S. restaurant chain to disclose which of its ingredients contain GMOs - which are becoming increasingly controversial as more diners seek information about what's in the food they eat. Third-quarter net income at Chipotle increased 15 percent from the year earlier to $83.4 million, or $2.66 per share. That fell short of analysts' average estimate of $2.78 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, as higher food, labor and rent costs squeezed margins. Chipotle narrowed its full-year forecast for same-restaurant sales to mid-single-digit percentage growth. The Denver-based chain previously said it expected low- to mid-single-digit percentage same-restaurant sales growth for 2013. For 2014, it forecast low single-digit percentage growth, excluding menu price increases. Analysts say Chipotle needs mid-single-digit percentage growth of same-restaurant sales to protect profits.

Hugh Hefner had put the legendary 5.3 acre estate on the market for $200 million but it is thought no one was willing to match that offer. According to TMZ, next door neighbour Daren Metropoulos has bought the mansion and has allowed 90-year-old Hef to remain in the property with his wife Crystal Harris, 30, until he dies. The Holmby Hills estate was designed by Arthur R. Kelly in 1927 and has 22 rooms including a wine cellar, screening rooms, a games room, a tennis court, a basketball court, a waterfall and a swimming pool. It also has a separate wing that houses the Playboy Magazine offices. Metropoulos, son of billionaire C. Dean Metropoulos, apparently bought the home next to the Playboy mansion for $18 million in 2009. Interestingly, this isn't actually the original Playboy mansion. The first of Hef's party mansions was actually a 70-room home in Chicago built in 1899 but bought by the media mogul in 1959. Credit: PA There was a period in the 1970s when Hef would divide his time between Chicago and Los Angeles but moved in to the current mansion full-time in 1974. Since the sale of the first Playboy mansion, the building became a dormitory for the School of the Art Institute and then in 1993, was gutted and turned into high-price luxury condos now selling at $6.7 million each.

While addressing the crowd on Sunday at the Mashable Social Good Summit, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the head of UN Women, urged advocates to use the power of social media to expand the conversation around protecting and empowering women. \"I would like all those men and boys...to stand up against violence against women [by] \"tweeting about it, hosting conversations, fighting against those sites that abuse women,\" Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the former deputy president of South Africa, said.

According to a 2003 UNIFEM report, one in three women will be raped, beaten, coerced into sex or otherwise abused. Established three years ago, UN Women has made stopping violence against women and girls a top priority. Mlambo-Ngcuka has impressed the importance of technology and men taking on a more active role in finally putting an end to such devastating figures. \"You need men –- you just cannot crack these issues without winning over men,\" Mlambo-Ngcuka said in a recent interview with the Associated Press. \"We need to win the priests, the rabbis, the traditional chiefs.\" The Easy Way Men Can Help End Violence Against Women',\n",

But for many drivers, going green wasn't the only reason to choose electric. According to research by auto data firm TrueCar.com, many electric vehicle buyers were attracted by the deals being offered by such manufacturers as Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Honda as they try to build momentum in the category. The Ford Focus offers a bit of insight into the divide between traditional and electric car owners. A typical buyer of the model's conventional, gasoline-powered vehicle is 46 years old and has a household income of $77,000. The Focus Electric, however, is typically purchased by a 43-year-old with a household income of $199,000. That pattern repeats itself across the industry, according to TrueCar. Buyers of the electric Fiat 500e average 45 years of age and have a household income of $145,000. That’s twice the money of a conventional Fiat 500 buyers—and two years younger, on average. For the U.S. auto industry on the whole, the typical buyer is 52 years old with an $86,000 household income, Krafcik said. Based on the manufacturer suggested retail price, battery-based vehicles typically cost more than comparable gas models. But that gap is closing as manufacturers drive down the cost of the green technology—and often swallow much of the premium in order to boost demand.

              "  'context': 'A new study involving men ages 66-97 shows that smokers who make it to age 70 still lose an average of four years of life, researchers in Britain say. Researchers Dr. Jonathan Emberson and Dr. Robert Clarke said they examined information on 7,000 older men -- mean age 77 -- from 1997-2012. They found that 5,000 of the 7,000 men died, but that deaths in current smokers were about 50 percent higher than in those who never smoked due primarily to vascular disease, cancer and respiratory diseases. Hazard ratios for overall mortality and various causes of death in relation to smoking habits were determined after considering other factors such as age, employment and health concerns. \"Despite recent declines in the numbers of people smoking and tar yields of cigarettes, smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death in Europe,\" Emberson said in a press release. He added: \"Previous studies had demonstrated that prolonged cigarette smoking from early adult life was associated with about 10 years loss of life expectancy, with about one quarter of smokers killed by their habit before the age of 70. Stopping at ages 60, 50, 40 or 30 years gained back about three, six, nine or the full 10 years. However, the hazards of continuing to smoke and the benefits of stopping in older people had not been widely studied.\" Emberson said the study shows that active smoking continues to increase the risk of death in old age. Average life expectancy from age 70 was about 18 years in men who had never regularly smoked, 16 years for men who gave up smoking before age 70 but only about 14 years in men still smoking at age 70. \"This study shows that even if you were to ignore all the deaths caused by smoking before the age of 70, older smokers still do considerably worse than older non-smokers, losing a considerable amount of subsequent lifespan,\" Emberson said. \"We have shown that even if a smoker is fortunate enough to survive to age 70 they still lose, on average, about four years of subsequent lifespan compared with men who do not smoke,\" Clarke said in a press release. \"Quitting is beneficial at any age and it really is never too late to stop.\" Meanwhile, a study earlier this year found that people who quit smoking before age 40 could live just as long as people who\\'ve never smoked before.

              "  'context': 'By Dorene Internicola NEW YORK, Sept 23 - Exercise trends come and go as step aerobics yield to interval training, weight machines are tossed for medicine balls and Pilates falls in and out of fashion. But when it comes to exercise habits, Americans say they prefer to stick to what\\'s simple, solo and short. Nearly 75 percent of 1,200 adults, aged 24 to 44, questioned in an online survey about exercise habits said they worked out at least once a week and 77 percent prefer to do it alone. Running was the most popular type of exercise followed by lifting weights and biking/hiking/outdoor activities, according to the survey by the watch company Timex. \"If it\\'s true, it\\'s good news for the fitness industry,\" said Dr. Walter Thompson, who studies exercise trends for the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). Thompson said the survey probably provides a \"useful snapshot\" into the behaviors of the responding age group. \"Outside that group,\" he said, \"it\\'s a little dangerous.\" Sixty one percent of people questioned in the poll during the last two weeks of August said they don\\'t exercise in a gym, and the average American is no early bird. Only 27 percent said they found time to get in a workout during the work day. Thompson cautions that people tend to exaggerate, at least a little bit. Some 29 percent of those surveyed said they spend between 30 minutes and one hour on their physical activities and 18 percent claim between one and two hours. \"Ask people \\'How much do you weigh? How tall are you? And I\\'m pretty sure most people will tell you they\\'re taller,\" he said in an interview. \"We know that among the general population about 20 percent exercise regularly, not say they do but do, and about, 80 percent don\\'t exercise.\" ACSM recommends adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio-respiratory exercise per week. As for the 26 percent of those polled who don\\'t exercise, Gregory Chertok, a sport and exercise psychology consultant for Telos Sport Psychology Coaching in New York, said the reason may be simply that they don\\'t think they can. \"It\\'s called the concept of self-efficacy,\" he said of the term coined by psychologist Albert Bandura in the 1970s. \"When people doubt their ability to accomplish a task, when they don\\'t feel competent, motivation plummets,\" he said. Conversely, he added, adherence to an exercise routine skyrockets when people consider it non-negotiable. Chertok said even the anonymous closeness of a gym environment can have a positive effect on the lone exerciser in it. Studies have shown that peoples\\' happiness depends on the happiness of people in physical proximity to them. \"The act of working out near or next to other health-minded gym goers can influence your own desire to be health-minded,\" he explained. So how malleable are exercise habits and how can they be changed? \"Many experts are jostling with that very question. While it\\'s tempting to say people aren\\'t exercising, people are becoming more educated, more influenced by social media,\" he said. \"Things are going to change.

Pfizer said on Monday it proposed a takeover to AstraZeneca in January worth 58.8 billion pounds ($98.9 billion), or nearly 47 pounds per share. It had contacted its British rival again on Saturday, seeking to discuss further a takeover. The chase was welcomed by investors in both companies, as deal-making grips the healthcare industry. AstraZeneca shares were up 11.7 percent at $76.69 in New York on news of the latest offer, which would be the biggest foreign acquisition of a British company and one of the largest pharmaceutical deals. Pfizer shares were up 3.8 percent at $31.92 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon. AstraZeneca said Pfizer\\'s suggested offer undervalued the company \"very significantly,\" adding that Pfizer wanted to pay 70 percent in shares and only 30 percent in cash. AstraZeneca urged its shareholders to take no action and said it remained confident of its independent strategy. \"I feel pretty confident of a higher bid coming,\" said Neil Veitch, global and UK investment director at SVM Asset Management, which owns AstraZeneca shares. \"I think it\\'s more likely than not that we\\'ll see an agreed deal somewhere in that 52 to 53 pound range.\" Buying AstraZeneca would boost Pfizer\\'s pipeline of cancer drugs and create significant cost and tax savings. Under British takeover rules, Pfizer has until May 26 to announce a firm intention to make an offer or back away. The renewed approach comes amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the sector, pushing the value of deals to $153 billion so far this year, as the industry restructures amid healthcare spending cuts and competition from cheap generics. \"Society wants products faster, they want more products and they want value,\" Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told reporters. \"Industry is responding to society\\'s request for increased efficiencies and productivity.\" Read said AstraZeneca had declined to engage in talks and the U.S. group was now considering how to proceed, but he remained convinced that combining the two companies made strategic sense and would benefit AstraZeneca investors. NEW DRUG PIPELINES Pfizer\\'s original proposal, made to the board of AstraZeneca on Jan. 5, would have valued AstraZeneca shares at 46.61 pounds each - a premium of around 30 percent at the time. AstraZeneca said the proposal comprised 13.98 pounds in cash and 1.758 Pfizer shares for each AstraZeneca share. \"My guess is it will go for somewhere between 50 and 55 (pounds a share),\" said Dan Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital, who raised his stake in AstraZeneca in February last year. \"I doubt Pfizer will want to go completely hostile.\" Most of Pfizer\\'s past deals have been conducted on a friendly basis, including its 2009 purchase of Wyeth for $68 billion. But it has been willing to play hardball if needed, as it did in 2000 with its $90 billion purchase of U.S. rival Warner-Lambert, with which it won full ownership of cholesterol fighter Lipitor, the best-selling drug of all time. Read told U.S. analysts that since the initial approach to AstraZeneca, both companies had seen experimental drugs fare well in trials. At the same time, Pfizer concluded it was too difficult to pursue big deals domestically while being on the hook for higher U.S. tax rates. \"We\\'re coming from a position of strength, on our near-term pipeline\" of experimental drugs, Read said. Recent favorable data includes results for Pfizer\\'s experimental breast cancer medicine palbociclib. INDEPENDENT FUTURE Pfizer\\'s declaration turns up the heat under AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, who has been in the job since October 2012 and who made clear last week he saw an independent future for the group, flagging spin-offs of two noncore units as one option to create more value. Soriot has been credited with reviving AstraZeneca\\'s previously thin pipeline of new drugs, badly needed to offset a wave of patent expiries on older drugs, and shares in the group have now risen more than 60 percent under his tenure. However, his overhaul - including an ambitious plan to move the company\\'s research and corporate headquarters to Cambridge, England - is still a work in progress and he has also come under fire from some shareholders over executive pay. Read said it was premature to say who would lead a combined company. Buying AstraZeneca would give Pfizer a number of promising - though still risky - experimental cancer medicines known as immunotherapies that boost the body\\'s immune system to fight tumors. It could also generate significant cost savings for the U.S. group. Acquiring a foreign company also makes sense for Pfizer as it has tens of billions of dollars accumulated through foreign subsidiaries, which, if repatriated, would be heavily taxed. The drugmaker has more recently been divesting certain operations, while mega-mergers had fallen out of fashion in the pharmaceuticals industry following scepticism about how well some of them have worked. HEFTY RETURN But CEO Read said large deals could also make good sense and buying AstraZeneca would \"maintain the flexibility for the potential future separation of our businesses.\" The transaction would complement both Pfizer\\'s innovative drug businesses and also its established products business - comprising older and off-patent medicines - which many analysts expect to be eventually spun off. In addition to using offshore cash, buying AstraZeneca would be tax-efficient since Pfizer could redomicile to Britain and enjoy lower tax rates, thanks to attractive incentives to companies that manufacture and hold patents in the country. Pfizer envisages combining the two drugmakers under a new UK-incorporated holding company, although the head office and stock market listing would remain in New York. But the suggested deal has triggered worries about jobs in Britain\\'s drug sector, viewed as a key industry by the government. AstraZeneca has already laid off thousands of staff as it shrinks its cost base to cope with a fall in sales due to patent losses on blockbuster medicines, while Pfizer has shuttered a research site in Sandwich, southern England. Read said Pfizer had contacted the British government about its plans on Monday, after Finance Minister George Osborne said on Friday that any deal was \"a commercial matter between the companies\". A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters on Monday that any Pfizer takeover bid would be assessed by \"independent procedures and frameworks.\" Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Guggenheim Securities are advising Pfizer, while Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Evercore Partners are working for AstraZeneca.

Naturally, this lead to someone bringing up Jennifer Aniston's nipples on Friends, which I only discovered were a 'thing'. I'd caught on to them over the years, but I never made a compilation and put it on YouTube, you know what I mean? I just put it down to a cold studio atmosphere. And then I remembered this one time from when I was a kid. Me, my mate and his bro were sat inside one Saturday on a grub break watching Friends. I don't recall the episode or particular scene, but it must have been one where Aniston's nips were having it large, cause it provoked my mate's bro to say: 'You know why you can always see Jennifer Aniston's nipples in Friends?' 'Nah, why?' we asked. 'She cut holes in her bra so her boobs could look good but natural' or something along those lines. Possibly more crass. As a result, I've had the great misfortune of looking at videos of Jennifer Aniston's boobs this afternoon and I've gotta say, I think my mate's bro was onto something. Credit: WarnerBros/NBC I Googled it, and found the most popular excuse was that Aniston simply had butch nipples. There were only two or three links entertaining the bra-cutting theory (and that it was the producers' idea), which although promising, doesn't rule it out entirely. Anyway, it's conducive to deal with big questions by asking everyone for their input, so what are you lot saying? Why are Jennifer Aniston's nips so prevalent on Friends?

              "  'context': 'Next year ends in a 7. If you’re superstitious or a little loose with statistics, that makes us due for another financial crisis. The biggest one-day stock drop in Wall Street history happened in 1987. The Asian crisis was in 1997. And the worst global meltdown since the Great Depression got rolling in 2007 with the failure of mortgage lenders Northern Rock in the U.K. and New Century Financial in the U.S. You can’t really mark the next crisis down on your calendar, of course. The point is that crackups come fairly regularly. And some of the prerequisites for the next one do seem to be falling into place. The International Monetary Fund may have gotten things about right in its annual Global Financial Stability Report, which was issued in October. It doesn’t sound an alarm but expresses concern. Short-term risks have actually abated, the IMF says, pointing to rebounding commodity prices, which help some key emerging markets, and the prospect of easier money in developed markets. But, it says, \"medium-term risks continue to build.\" It cites the unsettled political climate, which makes entrenched problems harder to tackle; some weak financial institutions in developed markets; and heavy corporate debts in emerging markets. Risks that aren’t acute can build for a while before triggering a crisis. What’s indisputable is that debt, the tinder of almost every financial conflagration, is growing rapidly. At 225 percent of world gross domestic product, combined public and private debt outside the financial sector \"is currently at an all-time high,\" the IMF says. Debt fuels growth but also makes borrowers brittle. Debtors keep owing money even if they lose the ability to repay. If they default, their lenders are damaged and sometimes default on their own obligations, and so the dominoes fall. The world’s banks are mostly stronger now than they were on the eve of the last financial crisis, but there are important exceptions. The stock of Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest, has fallen 62 percent from its 2015 high, and Chief Executive Officer John Cryan has so far resisted an obvious solution to shore up the bank, namely raising money by issuing new shares, which would dilute the ownership of current shareholders. The German government, having inveighed against bailouts for southern European banks, is insisting it won’t reverse course now for its own bank. In Italy, meanwhile, troubled loans on banks’ books equal about one-quarter of the nation’s GDP. Even in the U.S., investors don’t appear to regard big banks as any safer now than they were before the last crisis, according to a paper issued by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Natasha Sarin, a Harvard graduate student. The stock prices of the big U.S. banks are uncomfortably low, Summers and Sarin say, which implies that their \"franchise value\" has been eroded. That suggests that in a crisis they might have a hard time paying off their debts by liquidating assets. Ultralow interest rates aren’t helping banks’ ability to withstand a crisis. They squeeze profits—which banks need to build up their safety cushion—by reducing the amount banks can earn on the loans they make. It’s not only the level of rates but also the small difference between the short-term rates at which banks borrow and the long-term rates at which they lend. Two regulations that take effect in 2018 will begin to pinch in 2017 as banks prepare to comply with them. One, from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, strictly limits the amount of leverage that banks can use to make money. Another requires them to recognize expected loan losses more quickly. Although the rules should make banks safer, they could also further reduce their profits. If banks keep trying to thread the needle—scraping by without turning to shareholders for more capital—they could become even more vulnerable. Whatever the stresses on conventional banks, they probably pose less of a risk than the shadow banking system, says Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish, a unit of BNY Mellon. The \"design failure\" of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to reform Wall Street is that by raising the cost of operating a conventional bank, it pushed some money toward less regulated shadow banks, Reinhart says. The shadow banking system includes hedge funds, money-market mutual funds, and Wall Street securities lenders and borrowers. China may be the scariest source of risk on the horizon. Its growth rate has been driven by unsustainably rapid expansion of lending to businesses and households, says Bloomberg Intelligence Chief Asia Economist Tom Orlik. The government has signaled, through an editorial in the state-run press, that it wants the country to start deleveraging. \"So far it is not clear if words will be matched with deeds,\" Orlik wrote on Oct. 11. Chinese banks are \"the major risk, a potential detonator,\" says Samuel Malone, director of specialized modeling at Moody’s Analytics. He looked at the size, fragility, and interconnectedness of the world’s biggest banks and concluded that China’s Southeast Asian neighbors, particularly Singapore, are most directly exposed. China’s shadow banking system is huge and poorly understood, and the losses that it suffers could quickly be transmitted to conventional banks. Where the Next Crisis Will Come From',\n",

A trio of people caught attempting to smuggle exotic birds into Singapore were fined several thousands dollars each, reports Asia One. The smugglers, who stuffed six tiny birds into toothpaste boxes in September, were sentenced on Nov. 26 to pay fines of $6,000 each. The birds in question were mata putehs (also known as the Oriental white-eye), which are known for their beautiful voices, according to a statement released by Singapore\\'s Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA). The illegal songbirds were discovered when the smugglers\\' car was stopped at a routine checkpoint. Three people were fined thousands of dollars for attempting to smuggle exotic birds in toothpaste boxes. \"During the course of inspection, the vigilant ICA officers noticed that three toothpaste boxes inside the centre arm rest console of the car were moving and heard flapping sounds,\" the ICA statement read, in part. \"It aroused their suspicions and they immediately proceeded to conduct further checks.\" Two similar toothpaste boxes were found in a pouch and a bag. Singapore\\'s Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority bans the importation of birds under the Animals and Birds Act, unless a special permit is granted. Bird importing is also a problem in other parts of the world. The practice was banned by the European Union in 2007. Oriental white-eyes are native to swathes of tropical Asia, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, according to National Geographic. They forage in small groups and prefer small insects and nectar. They are also a favorite of bird smugglers. The Oriental white-eye, easily recognizable by its prominent white eye-ring, is a small bird native to parts of Asia that typically grows between 3 and 6 inches in length. Last year, a Malaysian national named Lim Chia Ming was sentenced to two weeks in jail for importing two dozen newborn Oriental White-eye birds in his underwear, reports Asia One.

              "  'context': 'Back when you were in your teens or early 20s, you probably didn\\'t date all that much. In an environment like high school or college, you were surrounded by men and women who were single and young just like you were. When you found someone, you hung out and really got to know each other before you fell in love and chose to marry. Fast forward to today, when one out of every four over-50 marriages is ending in divorce. Ladies, if you found yourself part of this generational statistic, when the judge banged the gavel declaring you officially divorced your friends probably told you what a great catch you are. They said that it wouldn\\'t be long before a great relationship came along. What they didn\\'t tell you is how to attract, date and keep a man this time. Whether you\\'re new to dating, or you\\'ve been stuck in a major dating rut, here are five easy steps to get you out there and start having fun dating. Step 1 -- Rediscover Your Mojo You are only going to attract a man who loves you as much as you love yourself, so now\\'s the time to find out what makes you so special. Start by making a list of all the things you love about you. If you can\\'t think of qualities you love, at least come up with things you are grateful for. The best gift you can give yourself is to stop comparing yourself today to your 20 year old self. You\\'ll never win if you do. Instead, learn to love everything about you as the awesome woman you are today. Step 2 -- Learn How To Flirt Whether you are meeting men online or in the real world, flirting is the best way to get a man\\'s attention. Online, you can flirt by favoring men. In real life, smile and make eye contact for at least five seconds. This lets a man know you\\'re interested in him and it\\'s safe to approach you. Step 3 -- Have Three \"Go To\" Dating Outfits In Your Closet You don\\'t want to be scavenging through your closet with nothing to wear one hour before you\\'re supposed to meet a man for a coffee date. Sales are happening right now on winter clothes. That means it\\'s the perfect time to find a couple of mix and match pieces that you can pull out of your closet at a moment\\'s notice to make you feel great. Choose soft colors or styles that bring out the feminine side of you that men so love. Step 4 -- Date To Date A man may not be your next mate, but he can be a great date. Plus, he can make a great friend who might be perfect for that wedding or party you don\\'t want to attend alone. Who doesn\\'t want a Saturday night out where he buys the tickets and you pick up the popcorn? Go on dates with men to meet someone new and interesting. At the same time, have fun enjoying male companionship while you\\'re still out there looking for Mr. Right. Step 5 -- Use The Four Magic Words Men Love To Hear Did you ever wonder why men were stepping over themselves to help Scarlett O\\'Hara in Gone With The Wind? Here\\'s a hint...Scarlett knew how to make a man feel both important and needed. In turn, men wanted nothing more than to make her happy. Men can do the same for you. Women have a tendency to ask men for help the same they would ask another woman for help. Women are fine hearing it this way but men hear it as demanding. If you want a man to make you happy, consider using these four magic words, \"I need your help,\" then watch how this changes how the men in your life respond to you. If you\\'re like most women, you probably don\\'t realize exactly how men think. What might sound like a total no-no to you as a modern woman is just what men want to hear the most.

The Hampshire city, home to around 45,000 people, has come out as the number one local authority for best quality in the study – knocking its fellow Hampshire district of Hart off the top spot, which it has held for the past five years. Hart fell to number 26 in this year\\'s rankings. Winchester, previously heralded \"the perfect English city\" in the annual Sunday Times ‘best places to live’ guide, stands out for its good schools, low crime and broad range of tourist attractions. It is home to the largest farmers\\' market in the UK, one of Europe\\'s largest cathedrals and dozens of upmarket shops and restaurants. A high proportion (96.6 per cent) of residents reported being in good or fairly good health compared to a national average of 94.6 per cent, according to the Halifax findings. Life expectancy rates in Winchester were also higher than the national average, with Winchester men expected to live to around 82-years-old, while Winchester women could expect to live until they were 85. Situated only an hour’s train ride from London and boasting an unemployment rate of just 0.6 per cent, Winchester boasts better job prospects than most UK cities. But despite the new number one spot, the city has also seen the highest house price growth of any UK city in the last 10 years, with house prices going up 79 per cent in the last ten years.  And it hasn\\'t always been regarded quite so highly, making a surprise appearance in the first Crap Towns book in 2003 and placing fifth behind Hythe and ahead of Liverpool.

Martin Ellis, an economist at Halifax, said: \"Looking across a wide range of indicators considered by our research, residents of Winchester in Hampshire enjoy the best quality of life in the UK, benefiting from a combination of above average weekly earnings, low crime rate and good health. \"On the other hand, there is a cost associated with a high quality of life with house prices in Winchester 9.7 times the average annual local income – significantly higher than the UK average of 7.2.\" 1.

              "  'context': 'Donald Trump tweeted a meme Saturday that used dog-whistle anti-Semitism to announce that his political rival, \"Crooked Hillary,\" had \"made history.\" The meme Trump tweeted prominently featured the Star of David — a holy symbol of the Jewish religion that Nazis attempted to pervert by forcing Jews over the age of 6 to sew it onto their clothing during Hitler\\'s reign. Emblazoned onto the Star of David in Trump\\'s meme are the words \"Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!\" The star lies atop a giant pile of money. Mic discovered Sunday that Donald Trump\\'s Twitter wasn\\'t the first place the meme appeared. The image was discovered Sunday that Donald Trump\\'s Twitter wasn\\'t the first place the meme appeared. The image was previously featured on /pol/ — an Internet message board for the alt-right, a digital movement of neo-Nazis, anti-Semites and white supremacists newly emboldened by the success of Donald Trump\\'s rhetoric — as early as June 22, over a week before Trump\\'s team tweeted it. Though the thread where the meme was featured no longer exists , you can find it by searching the URL in Archive.is , a \"time capsule of the internet\" that saves unalterable text and graphic of webpages. Doing so allows you to see the thread on /pol/ as it originally existed. Of note is the file name of the photo, HillHistory.jpg, potentially a nod to the Neo-Nazi code for \"HH,\" or \"Heil Hitler,\" which the alt-right is fond of hiding in plain sight. The image also appeared on a Twitter account that regularly tweets violent, racist memes commenting on the state of geopolitical politics. Other examples of images tweeted by this account include violent propaganda about Muslims and refugees and racist images of Clinton: Mic previously reported white supremacists rally on the internet to expose what they believe to be a vast anti-white conspiracy, centuries old, in which Jews have paid off politicians and infiltrated the media to undermine Western society from the top down. The Clinton meme Trump tweeted — which first appeared on perhaps the biggest bastion of the anti-Semitic alt-right — has brought that same hateful paranoia into the mainstream. One relationship of particular importance to their \"anti-White conspiracy\" is that between Jewish reporters and Hillary Clinton , whom they believe to be working in tandem to undermine the Western world, preventing nations like the U.S. from becoming more like their vision of utopia — a nation with racial purity among its core values. Trump has since deleted the meme and in its place uploaded an alteration that replaces the Star of David with a circle. In November, Trump retweeted a meme perpetuating the racist lie explicitly that black people committed more violent crimes against white people than any other race. That was found to have originated from the alt-right internet as well. Mic has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. We will update when we hear back.

The Tousled Side Braid This braided look (recently spotted on Chloe Moretz) is perfect for beginners. Plus, you can put on a hat and not worry about it messing up your look once you take it off. Use dry shampoo to build texture and keep your hair from getting greasy. Then pull strands over to one side and twist or braid them to the very end. Use an elastic ponytail holder to secure. The Fishtail Braid We wouldn't have made it through summer without the fishtail braid, and we can trust that it will take us right through winter. When you want to keep those flyaways in check, try a sleek fishtail braid ponytail like this one worn by Selena Gomez. Hair serum will hold the braid together. The Crown Braid Have a special event to attend? Then this beautiful braided 'do that Poppy Delevingne is sporting will certainly turn heads, and it can also be achieved by women with short, medium and long hair.

              "  'context': 'Universal His brand of comedy might be puerile, gleefully lowbrow and juvenile, but there’s no denying that in his heyday Adam Sandler made some genuinely hilarious films. They might not be works of art but for a certain section of film fans they were adored and, in the case of Happy Gilmore, still re-watched by this writer – plus, he also created the single best movie villain of all time, Shooter McGavin! Sandler’s films from his late ’90s peak are hilarious and part of the wider popularity of lowbrow comedies featuring schlubby man-children behaving terribly that was essentially started by Steve Martin in The Jerk and continued through The Farrelly Brothers right through to the Frat Pack films of the Noughties. Columbia Pictures Many of these films, like Dumb & Dumber, Happy Gilmore, American Pie and Old School, all plough a similar furrow and are considered comedy classics today. The man-child schtick is such a comedy trope in American cinema that it has even crossed the gender divide in Apatow female-led vehicles like Bridesmaids and Trainwreck. Take a look at a list of the best comedies made in the last 20 years and a large percentage of them will follow this pattern – perhaps perfected in Step Brothers – and there’s no denying that Sandler was a part of this. He belongs in the canon. But where and when did he turn from a maker of genuinely funny films to the man most associated with the abysmal disasters he’s been serving up for the better part of the last decade? Universal Sandler, who turns 50 today, made his breakthrough – and perfected his angry man-child with a heart of gold character – in 1995’s Billy Madison which while not critically lauded was a reasonable box office success, taking in $25 million (£19m). The success of Billy Madison jump-started Sandler’s career and kicked off a winning streak of comedies that were genuinely well-received, including box office successes like The Wedding Singer and Happy Gilmore. This streak couldn’t even be derailed by the misses, like the terrible Little Nicky. Columbia Pictures In the middle of this period, the ‘Sandman’ probably had his critical zenith when Paul Thomas Anderson utilised his child-like charm and explosive aggression to perfection in Punch Drunk Love, a more serious turn that Sandler repeated for 2007’s Reign Over Me. But in the timeline of Sandler, it seems like somewhere around 2005, after the release of the lukewarm 50 First Dates, Sandler’s films stopped being crass but charming, and instead became crass but shit. Which begs the question – what happened? Well, there are several possible theories... It’s Some Kind Of Weird Performance Art To Deliberately Ruin His Career Universal Fed up with making lowbrow but endearing comedies and tired of the Hollywood system, Sandler now only makes irredeemably awful films as some kind of weird performance art. Doing what’s known in the industry as ‘the Eddie Murphy’, he is hellbent on torpedoing his entire career as some kind of commentary on the fickle nature of celebrity by making piss-poor films where he plays multiple characters, puts on a weird accent, and/or does drag (Jack & Jill). Each film he makes will become more elaborately unnecessary than the last, until the release of his magnum opus – a film in which Sandler plays every single character and nothing happens except him walking around a mansion wearing clown make-up and a fat suit, slipping on banana skins and farting for seven straight hours. It’ll be like a vomit-flecked Disneyland version of Waiting For Godot, that instead of making you laugh, makes you question the very value of laughter itself in a world bereft of meaning. Then, as a final salvo, he catches a glimpse of his own reflection in a mirror and uses that patented Sandler aggression to fist fight his own bloodied reflection while laughing and crying at the same time. He Just Stopped Caring Netflix Alternatively, maybe he’s just become jaded and cynical with how poorly his films are received, and as a big middle finger to critics, he’ll star in literally anything that will guarantee him $10 million and a portion of the gross. He’s now just a kind of Adam Sandler automaton who roams from film set to film set, dancing on cue with a glazed faraway look in his eye until the director yells cut or an assistant comes along to drive him home. Maybe He Can Just No Longer Tell Good From Bad Colombia Pictures It could be that after nearly three decades in Hollywood, Sandler is just no longer able to tell what’s actually good from bad. There’s a chance he read/wrote Pixels/Don’t Mess With The Zohan/Grown Ups/Jack & Jill and genuinely thought they’d be funny and not the cinematic equivalent of urinating into your own face. It Doesn’t Matter, He Still Made Some Classics New Line Cinema At the end of the day, like every great band or actor who were once relevant and made great films or music but have now fallen out of favour, we can always remember Sandler for The Wedding Singer, Big Daddy and Happy Gilmore. And be thankful that, before he started bottle-feeding us his own warm piss, he made some damned funny films. Happy Birthday Adam! When Exactly Did Adam Sandler Give Up On Making Funny Films?',\n",

The 31-year old actress visited ‘Art in Island’ for her lifestyle-morning talk show, ‘Yan ang Morning!’ As part of the TV program, Rivera visits a lot of attractions daily. This time, she traveled all the way to the north for one of the most mentioned destinations for people who love taking their selfies. The museum showcases different paintings which creates optical illusions. These help people pretend, for example, that they were falling from a rickety bridge. The FHM Philippines first Hall of Famer couldn’t help but to be a ‘child at heart’ during her stay. She readily emoted and enjoyed the trip. In one picture uploaded on her Facebook page, Rivera had no worries looking funny when she acted as if she was stuck inside a bottle. The 3D museum made it look like the actress was trapped inside the the bottle. Feeding a popsicle to a tiger was no big deal for this actress. One of the images in the gallery helped Marian pretend that she shared a popsicle with a tiger. Her fans couldn’t help but praise Rivera for being outgoing and her funny antics. User @therealirishmaemont found Rivera's childish poses cute. While user @gi76len thanked Marian for letting her audience see new places in the country they couldn’t have known if not for the actress. The user also praised Rivera for promoting tourist spots in the country. The museum opened two years ago on Christmas day. Different from the usual establishments that collect art, this place does not prohibit its guests to touch anything. In fact, they encouraged visitors to feel and interact with the art as much as possible for the full experience. There was only one catch; visitors were not allowed to wear shoes inside the museum. They could either be barefoot or they can choose to wear their socks. But it looks like Rivera got an exception from the rule as shown in the pictures. River pretends to lead an army. The entrance fee is worth 500 pesos but they offer discounts for senior citizens and students. The morning show is one of Rivera’s comeback activities giving birth to her daughter Maria Letizia. Zia, what people fondly call her, is the first child of actress with husband, Dingdong Dantes. The actress received a sweet kiss from a fish during her visit. Aside from hosting, she also had a short stint as Ynang Reyna Mine-a, the mother of the four Sang’gres in GMA’s hit show, ‘Encantadia.’ ‘Yan Ang Morning!’ airs every 9:30 in the morning during weekdays. The 3D art museum was founded by Korean Yun Jae Kyoung and his partners. They worked for four months to build the place with the help of fourteen 3D artists. It’s the biggest 3D Museum in Asia for the number of paintings present but the one in Korea was bigger in terms of area. Marian Rivera gamely poses at 3D art museum\",\n",

In 2011 and 2013, Catherine Zeta-Jones checked herself into Silver Hill Hospital to receive treatment for Bipolar II Disorder. She has been openly public about her battle with the psychiatric disorder in an effort to rid the disease of its social stigma. The actress who plays Haley on Modern Family was forced to undergo a kidney transplant in 2012 due to her battle with kidney dysplasia, also known as multicystic dysplastic kidney. The condition causes cysts to form on the kidney. The 35-year-old model and reality TV personality suffers from the autoimmune disease psoriasis, which causes red, itchy and scaly skin patches. Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks went public with his Type 2 diabetes diagnosis in 2013. His doctors believe the severe weight fluctuations from his acting career may have played a role in causing him to develop the disease. Trump underwent an appendectomy, which is performed when the appendix becomes inflamed due to bacteria and/or pus. Modern science hypothesizes that living without an appendix makes it notably harder to rid one’s body of certain types of infection. Jon Hamm, the Golden Globe and Emmy award-winning star of Mad Men, suffers from a chronic skin condition called vitiligo. The condition is characterized by the death of skin pigment cells, and the consequent loss of skin pigment. Venus Williams is taking time away the tennis court due to her battle with Sjogren’s Syndrome, a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease in which the body’s moisture-producing glands are attacked by white blood cells. The 67th U.S. Secretary of State has suffered from fainting spells, concussions, and blood clots, as well as an underactive thyroid gland, for which she takes blood thinners and synthetic thyroid hormone replacement therapy, respectively. Miley Cyrus was born with tachycardia, a condition that causes a higher-than-normal resting heart-rate. Former President Bill Clinton has dealt with a number of heart hearth issues. He underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 2004, and had two coronary stents placed in his heart in 2010. The winner of a record 28 Olympic medals, Michael Phelps is the most revered Olympic athlete of all time. It hasn’t been easy however, as suicidal thoughts and alcoholism led to a diagnosis of clinical depression, followed up by time spent in a rehab facility. The Australian actor had two spots of skin cancer removed in 2013 and 2014, both from his nose. He expects these will not be the last spots to be removed. The TV star discovered during a regular cardiologist check-up that she has a leaky valve, which places extra strain on the heart and can cause congestive heart failure. In 2006, the award-winning singer-songwriter battled breast cancer with a lumpectomy, the removal of a piece of the breast, and radiation treatment. Crow has also been diagnosed with meningioma, a benign brain tumor that has thus far required no treatment. The U2 singer has had glaucoma since the 80’s, and wears his sunglasses so often because his eyes are extremely sensitive to light. This famous NBC News anchor of the 80’s and 90’s was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2013, a cancer that affects plasma cells, a type of white blood cell. The Dancing with the Stars winner was diagnosed with and underwent treatment for thyroid cancer in 2012. Thankfully the treatment was a success and she is now cancer-free! Bret Michaels has lived with Type 1 diabetes since he was six years old. More recently, he’s dealt with a number of extreme medical issues, including a stroke in 2010. In 2001, actress Sharon Stone was hospitalized due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a form of stroke. The comedian and actress had a heart attack in 2012, and has since shifted to a whole-foods diet to improve her heart health. Michael Douglas was reported to have throat cancer in 2010, though a few years later Douglas clarified that it was actually tongue cancer. The son of metal legend Ozzy Osbourne was diagnosed in 2012 with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. The young pop-singer was diagnosed with the autoimmune disease lupus in 2014. She checked into rehab for chemotherapy treatment the same year.

One features her mother, who talks about the lack of opportunities for women when she was younger, and the other highlights the life of Clark\\'s grandmother. The campaign polled its supporters to vote for the one that would appear on television, and the spot with Clark\\'s mother won.

              "  'context': 'Fermented apple juice used to be big in the US—or, rather, in the 13 British colonies that became the US. In colonial America, hard cider was more popular than whiskey, wine, and beer; scholars estimate that 18th-century residents of Virginia and Massachusetts were each drinking between 15 and 35 gallons of the stuff a year. During the 19th century, though, consumption declined, and the spirit never quite recovered after the era of prohibition. Today hard cider accounts for roughly 1% of the US beer market, according to Dan Rowell, CEO of the Vermont Hard Cider Company, whose Woodchuck Hard Cider is one of the top-selling American brands. But Rowell and other cider makers are witnessing a veritable boom in business, perhaps owing to a deepening interest in craft brews and the wave of adults seeking gluten-free alternatives. Like beverages brewed from grains, fermented apple juice comes in many tastes, and it’s just as ripe for small-scale, local appeal. Rowell recently told the Los Angeles Times that he predicts cider will capture 5% of the beer market before 2020. A new Woodchuck Hard Cider processing facility opened in Vermont in August; it’s 100,000 square feet and reportedly can fill and cap 600 bottles of cider a minute. Since 2009, hard cider has been the fastest-growing segment in the alcoholic beverage industry. Accordingly, big companies like MillerCoors and Heineken are getting in on cider pressing. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer company, introduced Stella Artois Cidre in 2013 and Johnny Appleseed hard cider in March 2014. Analysts predict that Boston Beer Co., which makes Samuel Adams beers, will owe a fifth of its sales volume to its Angry Orchard brand of cider by the end of 2015. Angry Orchard has climbed past European brands such as Magner’s Irish Cider to become the top-selling cider brand in the US. (Surprisingly, though, the Boston Globe reports that Angry Orchard makes its cider from apples harvested in Italy and France. That may be because there aren’t enough cider-worthy apples in America to meet the increased demand.) Some cider makers are hoping for policy changes related to the way alcoholic beverages are labeled in the US, arguing that current rules make the definition of \"cider\" too narrow. It can have only 7% alcohol by volume before being taxed as wine, and can only be lightly carbonated before being taxed as sparkling wine. Cider makers have said this is too fine a line to walk, especially since it’s tricky to predict exactly how alcoholic their experimental small batches will be. They’re lobbying to have the federal definition of hard cider changed to accommodate 8.5% alcohol by volume and to mimic EU standards on carbonation. Alcoholic cider has been popular in the UK for at least a decade and reportedly accounts for 15% of the beer market there.

Premium food, premium services and shows and entertainment worthy of Las Vegas are all just part of the deal when you book a cruise. Normally, when you’re arranging a cruise, you expect to pay a significant price for the luxury of fine dining and entertainment at sea – and most cruise passengers are paying substantially. But that doesn’t mean you have to. In the last few years the economy has made it difficult for many couples and families to travel much farther than their own backyards. This coupled with the fact that many cruise companies have built magnificent new ships complete with every amenity under the sun means you have a golden opportunity for discount cruise prices. Cruise liners are huge and they have tremendous amounts of space available for passengers. Would-be passengers are waiting for the economy to improve. This leaves you in the position to maximize on those unsold cabins by snatching up a once-in-a-lifetime cruise experience with huge discounts. You might only pay 20% of what other ship passengers are paying simply because you know the best ways to find cruise deals on the Internet. Best Cruise Prices Online You won’t find the biggest savings and cruise deals on the typical travel websites that you see advertised on television. You have to dig a bit deeper to find a company that knows this industry inside and out. Often there are terrific deals on last minute cruise arrangements as well as opportunities to book vacations well in advance to take advantage of special events and opportunities – including luxury sailings on brand new, deluxe ships to destinations like the Caribbean, Mexico, Alaska, Hawaii, the Mediterranean and many others. Spending Less On Your Cruise Building a cruise liner costs a lot of money, and the owners of these ships don’t want them to sail without recouping some of their costs. They are willing to practically give the cabin space and cruise experience away if it means having more people on the ship. But these steep discounts aren’t offered to everyone. Some cruise lines offer up unsold inventory for up to 70 percent off the listed prices. These deals are often only allowed through authorized partners, so you need to search for the best opportunity. While the economy starts to recover, the cruise industry will take much longer to reach full capacity again. That means you still have time to book an amazing trip aboard a luxury ocean liner on just about any budget. Interested in the possibilities? Search now to see what amazing deals you can find!

              "  'context': 'A conservative Republican Utah state lawmaker is backing an unexpected group of advocates: Mormon moms fighting for medical cannabis for their children. State Rep. Gage Froerer (R-Huntsville) has committed to help Hope 4 Children With Epilepsy, an advocacy group fighting for safe access to cannabis oil. The oil contains little to no THC, the chemical that causes the high in marijuana, but is high in cannabidiol, a compound that may fight seizures in some forms of epilepsy. Though legal in neighboring Colorado, the oil is not legal in Utah. Froerer said he hopes to change that with his support of the group, which was founded by four Mormon moms. \"If there’s anyone who can do it, it’s conservative Mormon moms from Utah,\" joked Hope 4 Children With Epilepsy cofounder Jennifer May in a phone call with The Huffington Post. May’s son, Stockton, 11, suffers from a rare form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome, which causes five to 30 seizures per day. May told The Associated Press that she used to think giving a marijuana derivative to children was crazy. But after witnessing unbelievable success stories like that of Charlotte Figi -- a 6-year-old girl who suffers from the same syndrome as May\\'s son -- she changed her tune. \"We’re not expecting this to be any kind of miracle cure,\" May said. \"But the results thus far with the children have been amazing with very little side effects. It’s just something that needs to be available.\" May considered moving her family to Colorado to get safe access to cannabis oil for her son. \"But we decided it wouldn’t do anyone else any good if we just left and didn’t fight to get this here. \"Some people think we’re crazy for not just going over there and bringing it back,\" May said. \"But when you think about how often our kids are in the hospital, our choice is between telling our physicians and risking getting in trouble, or not telling our physicians and risking life-threatening drug interactions with our children.\" Instead, May joined other parents of children with disabilities to rally for cannabis oil access in Utah. May and her cofounders are careful to distance themselves from medical marijuana. \"In Utah, a medical marijuana program is not going to go over very well,\" May said. \"Politicians here have promised to never let medical marijuana in the state and we don\\'t want to be seen as a toe in the door.\" May said she hopes the state can simply categorize cannabis oil as legal instead of legalizing medical marijuana. \"It’s not making the kids high, it’s shown to be effective, but it’s labeled as medical marijuana,\" May said. \"We want to change that.\" After convincing Froerer, that goal may soon be a reality. In a meeting with Utah\\'s Substance Abuse Advisory Council next month, Froerer will appeal to the council to legalize cannabis oil with a THC content of less than 0.5 percent -- less than that found in hemp oil at the grocery store. He has committed to sponsoring legislation, if necessary. \"As legislators, I think we have a duty to think about what’s best for the people of our state,\" Froerer told HuffPost. \"If we can provide this without causing any unintended consequences, we should do so.\" There have been no clinical trials testing cannabis oil for epilepsy, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. But there have been examples of success, including Charlotte Figi, the girl with epilepsy from a conservative Colorado military family shown on the CNN documentary \"Weed.\" Regular doses cut her seizures from 300 a week to 1, according to the documentary.

Though the actual series has 151 Pokémons, nobody really knows the whereabouts of the rest (or the existence of them at all). In an interview with Business Insider, Johnsons shared some tips on what he did to win all of it. He chose water-type Squirtle as his first Pokemon because he didn’t realize that he had a choice. He would have gone with the fire-type Charmander, in reflection of his choice of Team Valor, the game’s red team.

The designation for \"unhealthiest president,\" however, is easier to bestow: President William Henry Harrison died after only a month in office in 1841. There are no reports of a chronic condition at the time of his election in 1940; Harrison rather fell ill shortly after taking office. He had won the presidential race with his running mate John Tyler, becoming America\\'s first Whig president-elect. On the morning of March 4, Harrison took his Oath of Office at the Capitol Building\\'s East Portico. It was a cold, windy day, with a noon temperature estimated at 48 degrees Fahrenheit . Harrison was woefully underdressed for the cold, opting to not wear a coat or any reasonable outerwear. He proceeded to give the longest Inaugural address in U.S. history. In addition to speaking for two hours in the cold , Harrison attended three different Inauguration balls. The exposure to the weather and frivolity proved too much for the new President and he caught a cold that persisted, soon developing into pneumonia. Harrison spent the bulk of his 31 days as Commander in Chief battling the malady, before he died in Washington D.C. on April 4.

The pop star just celebrated her 23rd birthday and upgraded her ponytail with some major blonde highlights. Now, Grande looks like she stepped back into her music video for \"Break Free\" featuring Zedd. Grande gave her signature ponytail a makeover for her special day, complete with a braid and silver rings on the top of her head. Ariana then celebrated her birthday by performing a special show at the Allstate Arena, as part of her Dangerous Woman tour. All of the credit goes to hairstylist Chris Appleton who used the Uberliss Maintenance System to create Ariana’s look, according to Hollywood Life. alien birthday princess space pony ????☝????️???? ☁️ ♡ thank you for the beautiful birthday glam @chrisappleton1 @rokael_lizama A photo posted by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Jun 26, 2016 at 2:26pm PDT \"The Uberliss maintenance line perfectly enhanced Ariana Grande’s signature look. To top it all off, I added some hoops for more attitude,\" Chris told the celebrity gossip blog. Apparently, hair hoops are all the rage because Grande’s fellow diva and pop artist Christina Aguilera debuted them back in May, as reported by Hollywood Life. Now, Grande’s hairstylist is revealing to fans how they can get her sci-fi look. \"First prep the hair with Uberliss Hydrating Shampoo and Uberliss Hydrating Conditioner to add moisture and light weight to the hair,\" Appleton revealed. Next, you blow dry your hair smooth, then curl each section with a 1 3/4 curling iron to create loose waves. Create a middle part in your hair, braid the middle, and add hair jewelry or jewels for interest. Then, take a section of your hair, from the ears to the crown, and tie it into a high ponytail. \"Finish using Ubeliss RituOil for hold and super shine,\" Ariana’s hairstylist added. Meanwhile, Ariana’s pink eyeshadow, black eyeliner, nude lips, and bold brows were done by her makeup artist Omar Rokael Lizama. Earlier this month, Ariana showed off her new blonde locks just in time for the summer, according to a previous report on MTV. She took to both Instagram and Snapchat to share off her new hair color and to let her fans know that her throat is feeling much better these days. Ariana even let her hair down so that everyone could better appreciate her new hue. moonlightbae A photo posted by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Jun 6, 2016 at 1:42pm PDT ♡ A photo posted by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Jun 17, 2016 at 7:39am PDT A photo posted by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Jun 17, 2016 at 7:50am PDT A photo posted by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Jun 24, 2016 at 9:16pm PDT ♡ A photo posted by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Jun 26, 2016 at 12:01pm PDT Maybe Ariana Grande will start experimenting with different ponytail styles.

The researchers wanted to see how the sports drink Powerade stacked up against different kinds of milk, so they subjected 15 men to four rounds of cycling on separate days. Each workout was followed by a different beverage: cow’s milk, soy milk, a milk-based meal supplement or Powerade. Researchers then measured their blood and urine to determine hydration and nutrient levels. Drinking a milk-based meal supplement after exercise led to better fluid retention than the other drinks, but all of the milk-based products were superior to Powerade in terms of rehydrating the body post-exercise. None of the beverages made the cyclers thirstier than any other. That said, Powerade had an edge in one regard: The men reported that the sports juice was the most pleasant (soy milk, unsurprisingly, was the least). Those who drank milk reported being more bloated and feeling more full—probably due to the protein content in milk—but they were more rehydrated compared to sports drinks. And as for water? Drinking plain water after exercise actually causes a drop in sodium levels, potentially leading to even more dehydration, the study authors note.

              "  'context': 'How long would it take to fall down a hole in the Earth and reach the other side of the planet? Even less time than previously thought, a scientist reveals. A scenario often presented to introductory physics classes is that of a \"gravity tunnel\" — a tube drilled from one side of the Earth to the other through the planet\\'s center. The answer taught for nearly a half-century for how long a fall through such a hole would take was about 42 minutes and 12 seconds. The solution to this problem depends on the strength of Earth\\'s gravitational pull, which in turn is based on its mass. As one falls through the planet, there is less mass beneath whoever is making the descent over time, so the force of the gravity experienced would lessen as one approached Earth\\'s center. [What If? 22 Crazy Hypothetical Questions (and their Answers)] Still, assuming no air resistance, the momentum from the fall could sling one all the way to the surface on the other side. Anyone making the fall would have to make sure to get away from the exit hole as soon as they flew out of it, or else they could drop in again, hurtling back and forth inside the gravity tunnel, like a weight swinging at the end of a pendulum. \"I guess you can imagine it like a waterslide that takes about 40 minutes to fall through that takes you to speeds over 8 kilometers per second (17,895 mph),\" said physicist Alexander Klotz at McGill University in Montreal. \"Halfway through the ride, gravity would switch directions and you\\'d go from right-side up to upside down. You\\'d have to grab onto the other end or else you\\'d fall back down the way you came. If the waterslide was made of glass, it would be like zooming through a sea of lava.\" Still, at least one major unrealistic assumption dogged this calculation ever since it was first made in 1966. Ignoring for a moment how drilling a hole about 7,918 miles (12,742 kilometers) long through the Earth is virtually impossible, the problem with the 42-minute solution was that it assumed the planet was uniform in density throughout like a marble. Now, using a more realistic model of the Earth, Klotz finds the fall would take only about 38 minutes and 11 seconds, about 4 minutes faster than thought. Klotz based his calculations on the internal structure of the planet as determined from seismic data. While the Earth\\'s crust has a density less than about 187 lbs. per cubic foot (3 grams per cubic centimeter), Earth\\'s center has a density of about 811 lbs. per cubic foot (13 grams per cubic centimeter). The density of the planet does not rise in a straightforward manner the farther down one goes — there is a sharp 50 percent increase in density at the boundary of the planet\\'s mantle and its outer core about 1,800 miles (2,900 km) below Earth\\'s surface. The physicist assumed there was no air resistance in the gravity tunnel. \"In my opinion, if you have the technology to dig such a tunnel, you have the technology to suck the air out,\" Klotz said. Surprisingly, Klotz found that he calculated almost the identical answer if he assumed the strength of Earth\\'s gravitational pull was uniform throughout the planet and equal to its value on the surface. This assumption works because Earth\\'s gravity \"only changes by, like, 10 percent as you go deeper — first stronger, then weaker — for like the first 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles),\" Klotz said. \"So if you start falling and picking up speed, by the time you reach a region in which gravity is significantly different from its surface value, you are going so fast that you spend very little time in this region.\" Don\\'t expect anyone to test these calculations with a real tunnel through Earth anytime soon. \"The Soviets tried digging as deep a hole as they could from 1970 to 1989 and only got 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) deep, about 0.1 percent of the way through the Earth,\" Klotz said. Klotz detailed his findings in the March issue of the American Journal of Physics. How Long Would It Take to Fall Through the Earth?',\n",

The disease was once one of the most feared in the world. Up to 30 per cent of people who caught it would die, according to the World Health Organisation, after experiencing symptoms including a high fever and the characteristic pus-filled spots. Spores of potentially fatal anthrax from dead people and reindeer that had been entombed in the permafrost are already thought to have infected 24 patients currently in hospital in Salekhard near Russia’s north coast. But health experts told the Siberian Times this was a warning sign that there could be worse to come.

In fact, put it in several. That\\'s how \"Broke Millennial\" author Erin Lowry saved $500 in a year on a $25,000 salary. The theater major moved to New York City in her early 20s after landing a job as a page on the David Letterman Show. The aspiring actress\\' job was to entertain the audience before the show started. It was fun, she said, but paid little. \"I had a vision of a starving artist and it\\'s almost this romanticized thing that kids do in college,\" Lowry told NBC BETTER. But Lowry soon realized her paycheck wasn\\'t nearly enough to cover the $950 a month she owed in rent. To make up the difference, she picked up extra work as a Starbucks barista and babysitter, often working all three jobs in revolving shifts in a single day. \"It was a pretty tiring time in my life,\" said Lowry. But she was determined to make it work and save money in the process. Lowry got paid in cash whenever she babysat, and got tips working at Starbucks. Instead of putting the money in a bank account, she deposited into envelopes. She split her budget into four categories and marked an envelope for each: Rent Money for Anna (Lowry\\'s roommate, who paid the utilities) Savings Fun Fund \"Every time I came home from either of those jobs, I would usually put 50 percent into \\'rent,\\' 25 percent into \\'money for Anna,\\' and then 25 percent into \\'savings,\\'\" she said. Extra cash would go into the \"fun fund\" envelope, which she joked was \"usually pretty empty.\" The 27-year-old said the envelope system is effective because you can see how much money you have in each of your budgets. \"I think it\\'s incredibly helpful to look into your rent envelope and see, \\'Hey, it\\'s half way through the month, but I still need $300,\\'\" she said. \"Or to look into your savings envelope and think, \\'Wow, in the last three months I\\'ve saved $200.\\' Especially when you\\'re in a stage in your life where every penny counts.\" The system keeps you focused on your budgets and prevents you from overspending, according Lowry. \"If you\\'re doing it the right way, it should be getting funded more towards the beginning of the month,\" Lowry said. \"You\\'re saying, \\'OK this is May 1 and this month I have $300 to be spending on groceries so that by the time you get to May 25, if you only have $30 left, that\\'s all you have left to spend.\" She said it also helps prioritize your budget \"especially if you\\'re trying to get your financial life together.\" \"I think it helps illuminate that what you thought were your priorities aren\\'t based on how you\\'ve been spending your money and it can help you redirect and refocus,\" Lowry said.

              "  'context': 'A day after claiming her party’s nomination for president, an exhilarated Hillary Clinton said she was \"still processing\" the emotions of the moment on Wednesday as she heard from people around the globe both excited about her success and deeply anxious about her Republican rival, Donald J. Trump In a brief but at times introspective interview, Mrs. Clinton said that although other countries have been led by women, such a milestone would be different were it to happen in the United States. She called the demands of the American political system more personally grueling and difficult. \"I really believe our system is probably the most challenging in the world,\" Mrs. Clinton said. \"If you’re a prime minister, you’re chosen by your peers,\" she continued. \"If you’re president, you run statewide, but it’s usually with the backing of a party and you don’t have to raise the money to run.\" But, she added, \"Women candidates all face the same scrutiny, and questions about ourselves, so there are similarities.\" The implications of her claiming the Democratic nomination for president — the first woman to do so for a major American political party — became clear quickly for Mrs. Clinton, 68, in recent days. Prominent women and many male leaders have \"reached out to me in recent days to encourage me and say how much this election means to their country and the world.\" \"It’s something I’m still processing,\" Mrs. Clinton added. Her comments came days before Mr. Trump plans to give a major speech seeking to revive the scandals of the 1990s that entangled Mrs. Clinton and her husband, Bill, and criticize the foundation the family has run. She vowed not to respond to his personal attacks and said she would continue to use his words against him. \"I am responding to his very apparent lack of qualifications to be president based on what he has said and done and the temperamentally unfit person he is,\" Mrs. Clinton said. She joined Republican leaders including Speaker Paul D. Ryan in denouncing Mr. Trump’s comments last week that a Mexican-American judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel of United States District Court, had been biased against Mr. Trump because of his heritage. Mrs. Clinton went beyond her previous characterization of Mr. Trump’s remarks, saying on Wednesday that his attack on Judge Curiel based on his ethnicity was \"an outrageous, racist attack.\" But even as Mrs. Clinton tried to portray a steely fortitude in facing Mr. Trump, and a determination not to allow his personal attacks to get her off course, she offered a glimpse of the toll that reliving some of her lowest and most publicly humiliating moments would take. Throughout her second presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton has drawn on the inspiration of her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who was born into poverty and neglect and taught her daughter, from an early age, to confront bullies and stand up for herself. \"She was such a stalwart support in every way, mostly personal, but she would have been excited; she would have been proud,\" Mrs. Clinton said about how Mrs. Rodham would have viewed the events of the past few days. But, Mrs. Clinton also suggested that her mother would be eager to protect her from the attacks to come. \"She might have been a little apprehensive,\" she said. \"This is a very big step.\" Mrs. Clinton offered a vigorous defense of a decision which has haunted her primary campaign — her acceptance of large amounts of money for giving speeches to Wall Street banks, a practice that even her most ardent supporters have viewed as puzzlingly self-defeating. Mrs. Clinton called such speeches that garner six-figure fees \"the norm\" for previous secretaries of state. \"I actually think it makes sense,\" she added. When pressed on why, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the Occupy Wall Street movement, she chose to give such speeches, Mrs. Clinton reiterated that she had put forth \"the most specific plan\" of any candidate to regulate the financial industry. \"A lot of people know you have a front-row seat in what is going on in the world, so maybe you have some interesting observations about political or economic concerns,\" Mrs. Clinton explained. \"That to me is how it came about, and that’s what I talked about when I was making speeches.\" During the interview, Mrs. Clinton seemed almost to be trying to grapple with the meaning of her achievement and the overall restive mood of the country. She seemed also to be wrestling with themes she publicly raised, at times to mockery, in her early years in the White House — about whether the country has lost its sense of larger mission and community. \"It’s important people feel like they’re part of a larger national purpose,\" Mrs. Clinton said. \"It makes a big difference if people have jobs with dignity and purpose.\" \"I’ve thought a lot and spoken about, from time to time,\" the need for more \"love and kindness.\" Or, as she put it in 1993, drawing on the reflections of the Republican operative Lee Atwater as he faced death, \"a little heart, a lot of brotherhood.\" \"I think in this campaign I’ve tried to raise some of those themes again,\" she continued. Now that she has finished a primary battle that stretched on far longer than she expected, Mrs. Clinton, speaking from her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., planned to visit the local bookstore. \"I’ll finally have a break where I’ll have some time,\" she said. \"I love to wander around bookstores and see what strikes my fancy.\" She pointed to one book she had read recently that she said would stay with her through the general election: the swimmer Diana Nyad’s memoir, \"Find a Way,\" about her nearly 111-mile swim at age 64 from Cuba to Florida. \"When you’re facing big challenges in your life, you can think about Diana Nyad getting attacked by the lethal sting of box jellyfishes,\" she said. \"And nearly anything else seems doable in comparison.\" Asked if Mr. Trump would be her \"box jellyfish\" over the coming months, Mrs. Clinton let out a hearty laugh, then demurred. \"I don’t know about that,\" she said. ‘It’s Something I’m Still Processing’: Hillary Clinton on Winning, and Why Her Mother Would Be Nervous',\n",

              "  'context': 'By Laura Poppick, LiveScience Staff Writer: An ancient forest has thawed from under a melting glacier in Alaska and is now exposed to the world for the first time in more than 1,000 years. Stumps and logs have been popping out from under southern Alaska\\'s Mendenhall Glacier — a 36.8-square-mile (95.3 square kilometers) river of ice flowing into a lake near Juneau — for nearly the past 50 years. However, just within the past year or so, researchers based at the University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau have noticed considerably more trees popping up, many in their original upright position and some still bearing roots and even a bit of bark, the Juneau Empire first reported last week. \"There are a lot of them, and being in a growth position is exciting because we can see the outermost part of the tree and count back to see how old the tree was,\" Cathy Connor, a geology professor at the University of Alaska Southeast who was involved in the investigation, told LiveScience\\'s OurAmazingPlanet. \"Mostly, people find chunks of wood helter-skelter, but to see these intact upright is kind of cool.\" Stumps have been thawing from beneath the Mendenhall Glacier for about 50 years, but recently, considerably more have been found in upright positions with roots still intact. Credit: Jamie Bradshaw The team has tentatively identified the trees as either spruce or hemlock, based on the diameter of the trunks and because these are the types of trees growing in the region today, Connor said, but the researchers still need to further assess the samples to verify the tree type. A protective tomb of gravel likely encased the trees more than 1,000 years ago, when the glacier was advancing, Connor said, basing the date on radiocarbon ages of the newly revealed wood. As glaciers advance, Connor explained, they often emit summer meltwater streams that spew aprons of gravel beyond the glacier\\'s edge. [Images: Shrinking Alaska Glacier Spied from Space] A gravel layer about 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 meters) high appears to have encased the trees before the glacier ultimately advanced enough to plow over them, snapping off limbs and preserving the stumps in an ice tomb. Taku Glacier, located south of Juneau, is currently triggering this same process as it advances over a modern forest of cottonwood trees, offering the researchers a chance to observe the process in real time, Connor said. Unlike the growing Taku Glacier, which accumulates snow at a high elevation and thus is well situated to grow, the lower-elevation Mendenhall Glacier has retreated by an average rate of about 170 feet (52 m) per year since 2005. This year\\'s summer retreat has not yet been calculated, but the team expects it to be relatively high due to unusually warm summer temperatures, Connor said. Researchers have collected pieces of wood to date using radiocarbon dating techniques, and have found that the forest is more than 1,000 years old. Credit: Jamie Bradshaw Glacial retreat worries many locals who are concerned about the threat of rising sea levels and loss of major freshwater sources that they rely on for drinking water. Anchorage, the state\\'s most populated city, relies entirely on the retreating Eklutna Glacier for its drinking water. Still, glacial retreat does offer an interesting opportunity to investigate well-preserved remnants of an ancient world. The team plans to return to the Mendenhall Glacier to dig through sediment in search of pine needles associated with the trees, along with other vegetation. They also plan to measure the growth bands of the trees to determine how old the trees were when they died. \"These are relict stories, and piecing them together with radiocarbon dating and stratigraphic work would help piece together the chapters of the story,\" Connor said. The researchers have not yet published the results from the investigation but plan to do so once they have gathered more data. Copyright 2013 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company.

Diaz poured a large dose of cold water on the potential matchup, claiming that he was the top name in the sport considering all the people that wanted to fight him. \"I want to fight the best guy. I always want to fight the best guy. The thing is I’m on top...I’m the one on top — they’re dropping my name,\" Diaz said. He also claimed that he wasn’t interested in becoming the champion but would instead look for a big name fight at a catchweight. \"I don’t need no fake-ass piece of plastic,\" Diaz said when speaking to TMZ. \"Fu*k that! We can do a catch weight. Everybody wants a fight with me. Champions at 170, champions at 185, I said we can meet halfway. I don’t owe nobody nothing. I made pay-per-view without a title.

              "  'context': 'Is it possible to drink too much water? I typically drink far more than the recommended six to eight glasses per day, and feel dehydrated if I adhere to the guidelines. I have no underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, that would lead to increased thirst. Absolutely, and if you do, you can develop a dangerous condition called hyponatremia, or water intoxication. Under normal conditions, the body beautifully maintains its fluid balance. Lose fluids through sweating, for instance, and your body responds with the feeling of thirst. You drink. If you swallow more liquid than needed just then, your body typically responds by excreting the excess through urination. But should you consume so much fluid that your body can’t easily rid itself of the surplus, you dilute sodium levels in your blood. Osmosis then draws water from the blood into body cells to equalize sodium levels, and those cells swell. At that point, you have hyponatremia. If the cellular bloating occurs in the brain, it can be fatal. Until about 20 years ago, hyponatremia was extremely uncommon among healthy people. But then several marathon runners died from hyponatremia. In general, they had been middle- or back-of-the-pack, slower runners. They did not sweat much. But they drank plenty of water, trying to ensure that they would be well hydrated. Today, most knowledgeable coaches and exercise experts warn athletes not to overdrink. \"You should drink only when you need to, when you are actually thirsty,\" said Dr. James Winger, a professor of family medicine at Loyola University Medical Center, who has studied the hydration habits of athletes. If you’re not sure whether you’re drinking too much or too little during exercise, try weighing yourself before and after a lengthy workout, experts advise. If you have lost more than about 3 or 4 percent of your body weight, you’re probably flirting with dehydration and might want to drink a bit more next time. But if you have gained weight or your fingers seem swollen and your rings tight, you’re most likely drinking too much and should moderate intake. Most important, listen to your body’s signals, Dr. Winger said. \"Thirst is a very reliable indicator,\" he said, of whether and how much to drink. Ask Well: Can You Drink Too Much Water?',\n",

Back then, those surveyed told the committee that officials and teachers were not only dismissing incidents of harassment that were brought to their attention, but they were also downplaying the pressures of bullying that students can face.

Although the study had recruited women to speak about consensual sex, all of them explicitly spoke about problematic sexual experiences when asked about faking orgasms. Researchers said they were \"struck\" by the number of women who reported faking orgasms due during unwanted sex. \"While some women spoke about faking orgasm in positive ways, for instance, as a pleasurable experience that heightened their own arousal, many talked about feigning pleasure in the context of unwanted and unpleasurable sexual experiences,\" psychologist Emily Thomas said. \"Within these accounts, we were struck by the degree to which women were connecting the practice of faking orgasm to accounts of unwanted sex.\" Analysis showed women did not use words such as \"rape\" or \"coercion\" when speaking about their experiences, though their descriptions of the events could be categorised as such. Instead, the women were said to have described their sexual experiences as unwanted in more \"indirect\" ways, such as using the term \"bad\" to describe sexual encounters which were both unwanted and unpleasurable. Though faking orgasms is often seen as a joke, the study shows it is a complex phenomenon. Though it can be used as a useful coping strategy for women in unwanted sexual situations, the practice highlights the silencing of women who may want to reject sexual advances, but feel they can’t.

A study from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), claims that men who have sex with female sex workers feel less empathy for them than men who do not buy sex.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), sexual interests fall into two categories: normal (normophilic) and anomalous (paraphilic). Researchers asked 1,040 Quebec residents, representative of the general population, about their experiences of sexual behaviour considered abnormal by the DSM-5. The study, published in The Journal of Sex Research, found that of the eight types of anomalous behaviour listed in the DSM-5, four were found to be neither rare or unusual among the experiences and desires reported by men and women It suggests these women exist within a culture that discourages speaking up against unwanted sexual encounters, and where it may even be dangerous to do so. \"It appears that faking orgasm is both problematic and helpful at the same time,\" says Ms Thomas. \"On the one level faking an orgasm may be a useful strategy as it affords some control over ending a sexual encounter. We are not criticising faking practice on an individual level. \"We want to focus on the problems with our current lack of available language to describe women’s experiences that acknowledges names and confronts the issues women spoke of in our interviews.\" Women resort to faking orgasms to put a stop to unwanted sex, study finds',\n",

Hussin jumped into the creek and was able to grab the animal by the tail and pull it to shore. Hussin cupped his hands into a funnel and began performing CPR on the joey. \"I thought I might\\'ve been wasting my time, but I thought I would keep trying anyway,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"After ten minutes of performing CPR, the wallaby\\'s hands started to move.

But the overall pace of job creation is slowing as the economy approaches full employment, which is a level where virtually all who are willing and able to work are employed. Some economists see a slowdown in the number of people businesses are hiring as the natural outcome of an unemployment rate as low as 4.8%, although weaker capital spending and lackluster earnings growth have raised separate concerns. \"As the labor market continues to tighten, small businesses may increasingly face challenges when it comes to offering wages that can compete with larger businesses,\" Ahu Yildirmaz, head of the ADP Research Institute, said in the release.

The poll, which surveyed more than 2,000 Americans, found that 65 percent of respondents agreed with the statement \"People only use 10 percent of their brains on a daily basis.\" In reality, that statement is a myth. Brain imaging technology shows that people use their entire brains. Although not all parts of the brain are active at the same time (just like people don\\'t use all their muscles at once), throughout the day, all the parts of the brain will be used. Americans also have other misperceptions about the brain and brain diseases, according to the new poll, which was conducted by Harris Interactive on behalf of The Michael J. Fox Foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds research on Parkinson\\'s disease. [10 Things You Didn\\'t Know About the Brain] For instance, those surveyed said on average they thought 36 percent of Americans would develop a brain disease in their lifetimes, but the actual number is closer to 60 percent. And 71 percent of those surveyed agreed with the statement \"Men and women are at equal risk of developing brain disease.\" But studies show the risk of developing certain brain diseases varies by sex. For instance, men are slightly more likely to develop Parkinson\\'s disease, while women are more likely to develop multiple sclerosis. Only about half of survey participants knew that loss of the sense of smell is a sign of a brain disease. A loss of smell has been linked with all brain diseases, and more than 95 percent of patients with Parkinson\\'s disease have lost some of their sense of smell by the time they are diagnosed, the Michael J. Fox Foundation says. One of the goals the foundation had in conducting the survey was to gauge how involved Americans feel in the search for disease cures. Just 31 percent said they thought they could personally help to find a cure. However, \"there are many ways patients and their loved ones can help accelerate the search for cures,\" Deborah W. Brooks, co-founder and executive vice chairman of The Michael J.

One of the most interesting aspects of Instant Checkmate is that it shows not only criminal records, but also more general background information like court records, various types of licenses (FAA, DEA), previous addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, estimated income levels and even satellite imagery of known addresses—it’s really pretty scary just how much information is in these reports. In addition to giving information on the specific person you search for, the report also includes a scrolling list of \"local sex offenders\" for whatever region you’ve searched—along with a map plotting out the locations of those offenders. I started perusing the ones that showed up in my report, and I was absolutely blown away when I stumbled upon my junior high school wrestling coach’s mug shot. \"I was absolutely blown away when I stumbled upon my junior high school wrestling coach’s mug shot.\" His crime was listed as \"Out of state offense,\"\" so I wasn’t able to get the specifics (you usually can—this was an unusual case), but he was definitely a registered sex offender.

The lackluster stock reaction coming into the smartphone announcement is a departure from previous Apple smartphone launches going back to the original iPhone almost a decade ago. On average, Apple shares have gained 3.8% in the month prior to an announcement. The last iPhone, the shrunken-down and discounted SE, certainly sparked more interest, gaining 10.3% in the 30 days prior to the March 2016 announcement as the S&P 500 rose 6.9%. The lack of excitement is notable given the importance of the product to Apple; iPhone revenue accounted for two-thirds of Apple\\'s revenue last year, according to market research firm Trefis. All this shows investors, despite media hoopla, aren\\'t looking for much from the iPhone 7, says UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a note to clients. \"Investors already anticipate underwhelming iPhone 7 features,\" Milunovich says. Apple\\'s shares are lagging the market ahead of the iPhone 7 launch. (Photo: S&P Global Market Intelligence, USA TODAY via Microsoft Excel) The lackluster run of the stock ahead of the new smartphone announcement is even more disappointing since the stock typically runs into pressure afterwards. Apple\\'s stock has declined an average of 0.6% in the 30 days after the previous iPhone announcements going back to 2007. In the last four cycles, shares of Apple fell 4% in the two weeks after new phones were actually launched and made available, Milunovich says. The smartphone is a mature product and the company\\'s other offerings ranging from watches to tablet computers as well as music and payment services have failed to pick up the slack. Apple\\'s revenue is expected to fall 8% this fiscal year ended in September to $215.4 billion, says S&P Global Market Intelligence. Even with a new smartphone launch, next fiscal year, analysts see revenue inching up just 4%, a fraction of its 28% revenue growth in fiscal 2015 and 31% average revenue growth over the past five fiscal years. Samsung also continues to challenge Apple\\'s cash cow. Apple claimed 75% of the premium-tier smartphone profits in the second quarter, says Michael Walkley, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. But that\\'s down from Apple\\'s 90% share of profit in the first quarter due to Samsung capitalizing on better demand for its Galaxy S7 device, he says. Investors appear to be saying Apple\\'s halcyon days may be over. Shares are down 4% over the past year to $107.70, as of Tuesday\\'s close, while the S&P 500 is up nearly 11%. Investors are paying roughly 12 times for every dollar in earnings the company is expected to post this fiscal year, which is \"similar to other large computer vendors,\" says Milunovich, who is holding his price target on the stock at $115 a share. And that\\'s the bright spot for investors at least hoping the stock will stop falling as expectations are brought down. Consumers waiting to upgrade their phones may finally pay up for the iPhone 7 or new phones launched in 2018, Walkley says. Apple still also has a large captive audience of users to pitch its services to, Walkley says. Analysts think Apple shares should be worth $123.25 each in 18 months. \"Barring any surprises, such as an iPhone price cut, we see limited downside risk,\" Milunovich says.

              "  'context': 'The hot button issue over the past few months has been over who uses what restroom. Unfortunately, while we’ve been dictating who can \"go\" where, we’ve been blinded by an even scarier truth (not a potential threat, but an actual one). Folks, we’ve been asking the wrong question. Instead of worrying about who \"uses\" what bathroom, we need to be concerned with who is \"WATCHING\" us in the bathroom, because you might be surprised. Recently, investigators in Florida have uncovered some very disturbing information regarding public restrooms, Hotel rooms and your privacy. Disguised as normal looking \"Coat Hooks\" these tiny deviced typically stuck to walls are actually spy cameras. \"In all three incidents, miniature cameras hidden in coat hooks were found mounted on the walls in the women’s restrooms. They were found at Anne’s Beach on May 26th, the Circle K Store at the 99.8 mile marker of Highway U.S. One on May 28th and in the women’s bathroom at Harry Harris Park in Tavernier today.\" At three different locations in the Florida Keys, investigators discovered hidden cameras in the women’s restrooms. However, these cameras weren’t hidden somewhere undetected. In fact, they were usually in plain sight, and nobody ever realized it. We live in a time where technology has made our lives more convenient, but that convenience unfortunately comes at a price. And that price is our privacy. Motion-activated cameras that look like coat hangers have been found on the back of doors in several public restrooms, but who knows how long they have been there, or if there are more throughout the state (or country). \"Anyone who has a public restroom on their property needs to check them closely,\" said Monroe County Sheriff Rick Ramsay. \"If you find anything suspicious you think might contain a hidden camera, don’t touch it. Call us right away and we will respond.\" With the size of today’s cameras getting smaller and smaller, perverts are able to hide theirs inside small objects of many kind. Unless you know to be aware, you would have no idea you’re being watched. \"Nowadays, with the advances in technology, all you need to do is insert a MicroSD card,\" private investigator Carrie Kerskie stated. \"The battery life for these coat hooks, I looked it up, is two hours. Then, you just take it out, pop it in the computer, and you have all your images. It’s real simple and easy. They just walk in, hang it up, walk out, go back a few hours later and take it off.\" The terrifying reality about these cameras is that they are incredibly easy to purchase, and are actually advertised as home security cameras. Unfortunately, these devices have seemingly gotten into the wrong hands. The advertising for these cameras even show someone being spied on in a locker room. What Should I Do? First of all, you shouldn’t fear. These reports have only come from Florida (so far), so chances are you haven’t been spied on (yet). What we need to do is be aware of our surroundings. When using a public restroom, give the stall a quick glance and see if there is anything strange about it. The other thing we can do is spread the word. This could have a devastating impact on someone’s life if they were to fall victim to one of these ‘peeping Toms.’ Simply making others aware that this exists gives them the heads-up that this is out there. The media wants you to get fired up about who uses what restroom, when really we should be concerned about who is WATCHING us in the restroom.

This habit is especially important during the cold-weather months, when my complexion can turn ashy within minutes of walking outside. Over the past year, there's been a lot of hype about face oils. While dabbling here and there with these oily moisturizers, I've consistently stuck with my usual lotions. But when Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Skin Therapy Face Oil landed on my desk, I was certainly intrigued. Like most African-American women, I grew up in a household where my mother kept cocoa butter lotion stocked in our toiletries closet. She was adamant about me slathering on the buttery concoction before I even thought about slipping into my school uniform. (Clearly, this is why I am addicted to possessing skin with impeccable sheen.) So if Palmer's Cocoa Butter lotion hadn't failed me after all these years, then there was no harm in trying out the brand's latest skincare product. Palmer’s Cocoa Butter Formula Skin Therapy Oil FACE, $10, Available at food, drug and mass stores. Formula Skin Therapy Face Oil is poured into a not-so-fancy brown bottle, but that's okay, because what's really enticing lies inside. It is blended with ten different oils, including coconut, almond and argan, as well as wrinkle-reducing and skin-brightening ingredients retinol and vitamin C. Rosehip fragrance gives this face oil a floral aroma that brought the drugstore product to a luxurious level. I must admit that I was a bit hesitant about putting my morning moisturizer to the side and relying on this oil. Yet, it only took one-half of the medicine dropper (compared to my usual dollop of lotion) to coat my entire face. The dryness and flakiness around corners of my nose and beneath my eyebrows that often requires me to be heavy-handed with the lotion was no longer there. And I was pleasantly surprised by how soft and supple my complexion had become over three weeks. I guess this face oil has earned a permanent spot in my bathroom cabinet. Rating: 4 out of 5. To put it simply, this is complexion perfection in a bottle. I just wish the medicine dropper wasn't finicky.

              "  'context': 'New research from Consumer Reports shows that pregnant women should avoid all tuna, contrary to the Food and Drug Administration\\'s description of light canned tuna as a fish \"lower in mercury.\" \"Tuna happens to be one of the fish that can be very high in mercury, and some types of tuna have higher levels than others,\" Jean Halloran, Director of Food Policy Initiative at Consumer Reports told The Huffington Post. \"The type that tends to get used in sushi is often very high, but even canned light tuna, which tends to average pretty low levels and is generally one of the safer fish to eat, occasionally has these spikes of high levels of mercury.\" Because pregnant woman can\\'t tell which individual cans may have higher levels of tuna, Consumer Reports recommends that pregnant women simply skip all tuna throughout their entire pregnancy. The findings were published online Thursday on online and will appear in the Oct. 2014 issue of the nonprofit\\'s magazine, Consumer Reports. The FDA\\'s advice on light canned tuna is from 2004, and the federal agency is poised to overhaul all its advice on seafood consumption soon, reports the Wall Street Journal. But a draft of the new recommendations, subject to final approval, still lists light canned tuna as a low-mercury fish for vulnerable groups. Seafood contains nutrients like protein, iron and omega-3 fatty acids, which are especially vital for the growth and brain development of fetuses, breastfeeding babies and young children. But certain kinds of seafood, especially larger fish, can contain a neurotoxin called methylmercury (commonly referred to as simply \"mercury\") that can cause severe birth defects like blindness, deafness and mental retardation if fetuses are exposed to the metal in utero. Canned tuna was once the most widely-consumed type of seafood in the U.S., and in 2012 still came in second, after shrimp. Despite the rankings, all canned seafood, of which tuna is the leader, dropped to its lowest level in more than 15 years, reports the Washington Post -- perhaps because of health concerns like mercury. Currently, the FDA recommends that pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, nursing mothers and young children also stay away from shark, swordfish, king mackarel and tilefish -- recommendations that Consumer Reports agrees with. But when it comes to the FDA\\'s recommendations of which seafood those groups should eat, the government agency stops short of a comprehensive list, save these suggestions: salmon, shrimp, pollock, tilapia, catfish, cod and light canned tuna, about two to three times a week. To give people a wider selection of low-mercury seafood, CR took the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s data on the average amount of mercury per fish and listed them into two groups: \"Lowest\" mercury and \"Lower\" mercury as part of their report. \"The best fish on the list is salmon,\" said Halloran. \"Virtually all the canned salmon in stores is wild Alaskan salmon, and it\\'s a very good substitute for canned tuna -- it\\'s just a little more work, because you have to take the bones out.\" To see Consumer Report\\'s list of the 17 best seafoods with low mercury levels, check out the slideshow below.

In the case of the world\\'s humpback whales, it\\'s some good news the size of a bus. \"Humpback Whales,\" a new IMAX documentary from MacGillivray Freeman Films, narrated by Ewan McGregor, explores the lives of these majestic creatures, their unique behaviors and their remarkable recovery from the threat of extinction. The film was shot on location in Alaska, Hawaii and Tonga over 3 1/2 years. \"We\\'ve been working on trying to get this film done for 10 years,\" director Greg MacGillivray told The Huffington Post. His son Shaun, who produced the film, explained that a partnership with Pacific Life finally helped make the film happen. Shaun said that they had to be in the right spot at the right time, like any other wildlife film, but shooting such large creatures underwater was even more challenging. \"It was tough, but we ended up getting fantastic shots,\" he said. The film is about celebrating these remarkable animals, said Fred Sharpe, a scientist who\\'s featured in the film, and \"their unusual cooperative behaviors and social prowess.\" The filmmakers were able to capture footage of humpbacks\\' bubble-netting behavior, during which they work together to create a net of bubbles and trap schools fish. Sharpe\\'s work also includes freeing whales from entanglements with nets and derelict fishing gear. Sharpe said there were 30 confirmed entanglements off California last year and they\\'ve already responded to three this year. \"If we get our gear on the animal, I\\'ve been 100 percent successful in disentangling,\" he told HuffPost. Amanda Keledjian, a marine scientist with the advocacy group Oceana who was not involved with the film, told HuffPost that the central North Pacific population of humpbacks, which spends its summers in Alaska and winters in Hawaii, has been growing about 7 percent per year since the early 1980s. But there are only an estimated 1,500 whales left in that population, so recovery efforts are ongoing. \"This emerging success story is a great example that when the appropriate precautions and protective regulations are put in place, populations can in fact begin to rebuild,\" Keledjian said. \"We have to hope that other dwindling populations of marine animals, such as some sharks and sea turtles situations, can garner the same amount of concern and attention in the coming years.\" The MacGillivrays hope the film inspires the public to care more about the health of the oceans and marine animals and get kids inspired about science and oceanography. \"It\\'s amazing how much more we still have to learn about these incredible animals,\" Shaun said. The film is also sponsoring an online sweepstakes featuring a grand prize trip to Alaska with a voyage aboard a ship featured in the film.

The exact facts surrounding the births of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s children were shrouded in secrecy for security reasons – until now. To help her through the labour, Kate had at her disposal: two obstetricians, three midwives, three anaesthetists, four theatre staff, two special care baby unit staff, four paediatricians, one laboratory technician to check blood samples and four senior managers. The Duchess, 34, gave birth to both children at the exclusive Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, London. \"We had a huge team,\" Professor Tiong Ghee Teoh, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the hospital told The Daily Telegraph. \"I was back-up to Guy Thorpe-Beeston, who led the team, but for anything that could possibly go wrong we had a team of people behind each specialty. \"Everyone was sworn to secrecy about who it was.\" Professor Teoh said the team met monthly to discuss Kate’s birth plan and then weekly as the due date got closer. Describing her as a \"fit young lady\", he added: \"They are the best patients. \"At the end of the day you want to deliver a healthy, happy baby to a healthy, happy mother – and that’s what happened.\" But it seems Kate didn’t really get any special royal treatment – according to Professor Teoh most mums-to-be have this amount of people involved in our births. The difference is, they don’t have named doctors – it’s whoever is on call that day. Kate’s luxurious private delivery suite cost an average of £4,965 a night and featured an en suite, wireless internet, satellite TV and champagne on request.

But anyone who’s ever been left barefoot on the cold airport floor has likely wondered: Should I be wearing socks? The short answer: Probably. \"Just about every floor surface—at shopping centers, gyms, airports, and other places—is coated in bacteria like E. coli and Staph as well as other pathogens,\" says Kathryn H. Jacobsen, Ph.D., a professor of epidemiology and global health at George Mason University. If that bacteria seeps into your skin, you\\'re at risk for an infection. It sounds scary—and it’s better to be safe than sorry—but keeping your feet covered is mostly precautionary. Jacobsen says that for most of us, the risk of contracting an infection from going sock-less at security is pretty low. In part, that’s because security lines are well-ventilated and have dry floors, so you’re unlikely to pick up either foot fungi (think: athlete’s foot) or plantar warts—both of which tend to come from damp environments, like locker rooms with showers. There are exceptions. Anyone with a weakened immune system (for example, if you suffer from diabetes-related foot problems) or with cuts on their feet could more easily have pathogens enter the body, Jacobsen says.

Past studies have examined the relationship between height and lifespan of populations around the world, suggesting that shorter people generally live longer lives, while taller people are more likely to have certain illnesses and develop various types of cancer. Now, thanks to new research published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers have finally discovered the secret behind shorter people\\'s longevity: It\\'s in their genes. Using data from a long-term observational study of Japanese-American men in Hawaii, researchers demonstrated that a gene linked to longevity, called FOXO3, is also linked to body size. What\\'s more, researchers found that the shorter a person was, the more likely they were to have a long life. In one of the world\\'s largest and longest-running studies of aging men, researchers at the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine, Kuakini Medical Center and U.S. Veterans Affairs ran an analysis by dividing more than 8,000 subjects into two height groups -- 5\\'2\" and shorter and 5\\'4\" and taller -- and looking at their heights, health and death rates over a 40 year period. \"The folks who were 5\\'2\" and shorter lived the longest,\" Dr. Bradley Wilcox, a researcher and professor at the UH Manoa\\'s Department of Geriatric Medicine, told Hawaii News Now. \"They also had lower fasting insulin levels and got less cancer.\" And while 5\\'2\" is very short -- the average height of an American male is 5\\'9\" -- the results were heartening for \"taller\" short guys too: Data showed that lifespan and stature were linked so that the taller a man was, the shorter his lifespan was as well: The research showed, for the first time, that the \"longevity gene\" FOXO3 is linked to human body size. \"We knew that in animal models of aging. We did not know that in humans,\" Dr. Willcox said in a statement. \"We have the same or a slightly different version [of the gene] in mice, roundworms, flies, even yeast ... it’s important in longevity across all these species.\" \"The small yeast, flies and mice have genes like FOXO3 that dampen insulin signaling and make them smaller from birth,\" said Dr. Willcox of the image above. In order to make that same connection with their human subjects, Dr. Willcox and his team compared the genotypes of men that lived to be 95 years and older with those in the study who lived an average lifespan. \"What we found was that those who lived a long time versus those who lived an average time tended to have a certain version of the FOXO3 gene,\" Dr. Willcox told HuffPost. They discovered that people with the \"protective\" version of the gene had double the odds of living to 100 -- triple, if the person inherited that gene from both parents. \"If you\\'re bigger you have more cells, so you have to grow more and you use up a lot of those cells,\" researcher Dr. Tim Donlon theorized to Hawaii News Now. \"My feeling is that if you\\'re shorter, you have a reserve of cells you can use later in life, and that might have some impact on why shorter people or smaller people have a longer life span.\" As Hawaii News Now points out, the longevity gene acts \"like a stress resistance gene. It sees problems and fixes them. For example, if there are too many cancer cells around, it will eradicate them. Everyone has it, but only 4 percent of people have the protective version.\" \"One of the reasons why Honolulu is perfect for this kind of study is that we have the longest-lived state in the country, combined with a population that has remained, for the most part, in Hawaii,\" Dr. Willcox said in a statement. He also noted that \"no matter how tall you are you can still live a healthy lifestyle\" to make up for not having the protective FOXO3 gene. While the study could potentially apply to women and other ethnicities, researchers say that more research is needed to verify whether the results can be generalized beyond Japanese-American men. But Dr. Willcox seems confident that it will. \"People aren\\'t all that different. Genetically, we\\'re all pretty similar,\" he told HuffPost. \"If this effect applies to model organisms, than you can be pretty sure that it applies to other humans because humans are a lot more similar to each other than they are to model organisms.\" Short?

Along with the grunt phone, TUSK added a remote weapon station machine gun operated from inside the vehicle, a loader\\'s armor gun shield, reactive armor tiles fitted to side skirts, a remote thermal sight, and a power-distribution box.

Experts at Citizen Lab worked with security company Lookout and determined that the link would have installed a program taking advantage of a three flaws that Apple and others were not aware of. The researchers disclosed their findings Thursday. \"Once infected, Mansoor’s phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements,\" Citizen Lab wrote in a report released Thursday. ( AAPL -0.43% ) The researchers said they had alerted Applea week and a half ago, and the company developed a fix and distributed it as an automatic update to iPhone 6 owners. Apple spokesman Fred Sainz confirmed that the company had issued the patch after being contacted by researchers. The Citizen Lab team attributed the attack software to a private seller of monitoring systems, NSO Group, an Israeli company that makes software for governments which can secretly target mobile phones and gather information. Tools such as that used in this case, a remote exploit for a current iPhone, cost as much as $1 million. NSO chief executive Shalev Hulio referred questions to spokesman Zamir Dahbash, who said the company \"cannot confirm the specific cases\" covered in the Citizen Lab and Lookout reports. Dahbash said NSO sells within export laws to government agencies, which then operate the software. \"The agreements signed with the company’s customers require that the company’s products only be used in a lawful manner,\" he added. \"Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes.\" Dahbash did not answer follow-up questions, including whether the exposure of the tools use against Mansoor in UAE and a Mexican journalist would end any sales to those countries. Low Profile NSO has kept a low profile in the security world, despite its 2014 sale of a majority stake for $120 million to California private equity firm Francisco Partners. That company’s chief executive, Dipanjan Deb, did not return a call Thursday. In November 2015, Reuters reported that NSO had begun calling itself \"Q\" and was looking for a buyer for close to $1 billion. Sarah McKune, senior legal adviser to Citizen Lab, said Israel tries to follow the strictures of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which puts controls on the international sale of nuclear and chemical weapons technology and more recently cyber intrusion tools. NSO may have had to apply for an export license, she added, saying that raised questions about \"what consideration was given to the human rights record of UAE.\" The Israeli embassy in Washington did not respond to an email seeking comment. NSO marketing material says that it also has capabilities for Android and BlackBerry devices. No version of the software has been exposed, indicating it remains effective. Citizen Lab did not directly accuse UAE of carrying out the attack on Mansoor with NSO gear called Pegasus, but it said other NSO attacks on critics of the regime were connected to the government. Others Targeted It also said a Mexican journalist and a minority party politician in Kenya had been targeted with NSO software and that domain names set up for other attacks referred to entities in Uzbekistan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and other nations, suggesting that other targets lived in those nations. A call to the UAE embassy in Washington was not immediately returned. The market for \"lawful intercept,\" or government hacking tools, has come under increased scrutiny with revelations about authoritarian customers and noncriminal victims. Two popular vendors, Hacking Team of Italy and Gamma Group of the United Kingdom, have had their wares exposed by researchers or hackers. Mansoor had previously been targeted with software from both of those companies, according to Citizen Lab. \"I can’t think of a more compelling case of serial misuse of lawful intercept malware than the targeting of Mansoor,\" said one of the Citizen Lab researchers, John Scott-Railton. iPhone Fix Issued After Hacking Attempt on Political Dissident',\n",

This week SIA helped James get to work and they belted out some hits and rocked out some wigs! AUSSIE-BORN pop singer Sia is currently winding her way around the world on her first large-scale tour in six years. But some fans aren’t happy after a recent concert in Tel Aviv — and they’re going so far as to sue the 40-year-old singer. The Jerusalem Post reports that a group of concertgoers who attended Sia’s show earlier this month — a 13-song set that included hits Chandelier, Cheap Thrills and Titanium — are filing a class-action lawsuit against her for around $US2 million. Their complaints about the gig are numerous, stating that \"even the live vocals felt impersonal, as the artist never once addressed the crowd, mentioned what it was like to be in Tel Aviv, or bantered in any way.\" Sia live in Israel Yes, Sia’s being sued for her lack of between-song banter. Other complaints included the fact that the video screens at the concert played prerecorded footage of Sia’s celeb friends like Kristen Wiig and Gabby Hoffman dancing, rather than relaying what was happening on stage. One fan told the Times of Israel that people \"felt cheated\" because \"the live show was an imitation of the recorded show and included actors and dancers who never set foot in Israel.\" \"She just stood there during the whole performance, toward the back of the stage and didn’t say anything other than ‘Thank You’ when the show was over.\" Other complaints included the brief length of the show — 65 minutes — and that the trademark face-covering wigs Sia wore hampered any connection with the audience. The singer seemed to address the controversy on Twitter today, acknowledging that her current tour is \"abstract\" but that every moment is \"purely intentional.\" I put everything I have into my show- it\\'s abstract for sure, but I\\'m singing my heart out live and every moment is purely intentional. — sia (@Sia) August 18, 2016 Surprisingly, the producer of the concert, 3A Productions, is quoted in the Times of Israel as agreeing with the harsh fan assessment of Sia’s performance. \"Managing an artist is a tough job, especially when it’s a diva,\" said a company spokesman, who blamed promoter Ilan Elkayam and his company, Tandi Productions. \"Tandi is a young company and beginners can make this kind of mistakes but we were definitely surprised since Ilan Elkayam has a consistent experience in this industry.\" In the unlikely event Sia does have to pay out on this lawsuit, it shouldn’t hurt her hip pocket too much: this week she marks one month atop the US Billboard Hot 100 with her current single Cheap Thrills, already a multi-platinum hit in Australia and the UK.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and her longtime aide Dan Geldon made the rounds in the House of Representatives throughout 2009, looking to persuade as many Financial Services Committee members as they could to sign off on her idea for an agency dedicated to protecting consumers from financial predation. Warren recounts one such meeting with an unnamed House Democrat in her new book, A Fighting Chance. I remember one meeting particularly well. A congresswoman who seemed really interested in what we had to say told me that she supported consumers and wanted to see them treated fairly. Then she raised a specific objection to the agency. I answered, but instead of talking about the issue, she moved on to another objection, and so on through a list of about half a dozen more problems. Despite her many objections, I felt a little encouraged. Once Dan and I were out in the hall, I said, \"Well, she didn\\'t agree with much of anything, but at least she was talking. Maybe we have a shot at persuading her.\" For a moment, Dan looked like he was weighing whether to give me the bad news. But Dan never holds back long on bad news. He explained that the congresswoman had just run through every talking point included in a press release issued by the American Bankers Association that morning. In order. Oh. A source close to Warren, familiar with the meeting, tells The Huffington Post that the congresswoman in question was then-Rep. Melissa Bean of Illinois. On Friday, Politico\\'s Morning Money newsletter announced that Bean has been named to a high-profile job with JPMorgan Chase, where she\\'ll serve as chair of Midwest operations -- a job previously held by Bill Daley, who vacated it to become briefly the chief of staff to President Barack Obama. Bean lost her 2010 reelection race to tea party favorite Joe Walsh, who subsequently was knocked from office by Democrat Tammy Duckworth after he suggested in a debate that there need be no exception to abortion bans in cases of rape and incest because of advances in medical science. During her tenure in Congress, Bean developed a reputation for privileging Wall Street over consumers and taxpayers. HuffPost\\'s Arthur Delaney profiled her in a 2010 story titled \"Melissa Bean: A Democrat Bankers Bank On.\" Morning Money -- which HuffPost has also profiled -- reported around the time of Bean\\'s election loss that she was being considered to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the same agency that Warren had been pushing in 2009. The idea was resoundingly panned by bank reformers. Bean declined an interview for this article. But former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who served as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told HuffPost that it\\'s unfair to paint her as a bank sellout. \"Optics, shmoptics,\" Frank said. \"The only issue where we differed [on the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation] was over the degree of preemption for the national banks. ... She didn\\'t want to go as far as I wanted to go.\" Despite strenuous objections from consumer advocates, Bean had wanted to block states from enacting tougher laws against predatory lending than the federal government adopted. She ultimately voted for Dodd-Frank after threatening to blow the whole thing up over the issue of federal preemption. At times during their congressional tenures, of course, both Frank and Bean agreed with Wall Street. Both voted against auditing the Federal Reserve, for instance. Frank noted that Bean also favored keeping low tax rates for hedge fund managers and private-equity kingpins, which he opposed. But he defended her decision to take a job at the nation\\'s largest bank. \"Melissa was very supportive of financial reform in general as a member of the committee. ... Do we only want people who are opposed to regulation working at these institutions?\" Frank said. \"I hope it\\'s a sign that [JPMorgan CEO Jamie] Dimon understands that this law is a reality, that it\\'s important to accept the framework.\" A former top aide to Bean, who wasn\\'t present at the 2009 meeting with Warren, said that while the congresswoman \"was certainly pro-business, she would never just repeat a lobbyist\\'s talking points.\" Bean may not have had to get the bank industry\\'s talking points from a lobbyist, however. In June 2009, she met with the man who held the job to which she\\'s now been named, discussing Wall Street reform with Daley and other senior JPMorgan officials. The bank\\'s executives donated $11,000 to her reelection campaign that same month, according to the Public Accountability Initiative\\'s LittleSis website. The meeting with Warren happened on July 10, the source close to the senator said. Just weeks earlier, the JPMorgan officials had made their case to Bean. \"She laid out how she saw the president\\'s proposal, and the difficulties politically in Congress, and Jamie [Dimon] and other members [of the board of directors] expressed their opinion of what they would like to see,\" Daley told the Chicago Tribune in 2009. But Daley added that Bean was not marching in lockstep against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"It was clear in June that she did not have a knee-jerk aversion to the concept of a federal consumer protection agency, in spite of all our brilliant arguments,\" he said. Next time around, it\\'ll be Bean getting to make the brilliant arguments. Former Congresswoman Now Officially Working For Wall Street',\n",

They offer a solid selection of creative paninis, including chicken with spinach, basil, roasted tomatoes, and provolone cheese, signature sandwiches like roast beef, arugula, and goat cheese on potato thyme bread, and \"Mom’s Sandwiches\" like smoked ham on white bread for the traditionalists. There are also breakfast scramblers, salads, soups, and fresh-baked pastries. 12) Jason’s Deli The popular Texas-based Jason’s Deli has more than 240 locations in 28 states, and business is booming. So what’s the secret? A wide variety of both pre-designed and build-your-own offerings (including a killer muffaletta),a solid salad bar, and a commitment to change with the times: they’ve eliminated trans fats and high-fructose corn syrup from their menus, offer \"lighter portion\" options, and have rolled out gluten-free offerings as well. 11) Firehouse Subs Firehouse Subs doesn’t just get its name from the hot sandwiches it sells it was actually founded by two firefighters, brothers Robin and Chris Sorensen, in Jacksonville, Fla. in 1994. Today there are more than 600 locations across the country, and they all have firehouse-inspired touches (as well as Coke Freestyle dispensers, the first major chain to have them). Subs also have firehouse-inspired names, like the Hook & Ladder (turkey, ham, and melted Monterrey Jack) other specialty subs include the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket, with beef brisket that’s been smoked for more than 16 hours topped with Cheddar and sauce. Their meatball sub is also killer. 10) Au Bon Pain One of the classics, Au Bon Pain was the first sandwich chain to take the gourmet route. Founded in Boston in 1978, the chain is known for its coffee, soups, pastries, and, of course, sandwiches. Sandwiches come both hot and cold, in varieties like Black Angus roast beef and herb cheese, chicken salad on country white with cranberries and almonds, and Chicken Pomodoro on ciabatta. The layout and atmosphere tends to be a bit more chilled-out than other chain sandwich shops, and you’d really still be hard-pressed to leave an Au Bon Pain unsatisfied. 9) Einstein Bros. Spun off of Boston Market in 1995 as a way to sell breakfast items (evem though they\\'re no longer owned by them), Einstein Bros. has officially taken on a life of its own with more than 820 locations in 40 states. The menu is of course heavy on bagels, fresh-baked in more than 20 varieties including chocolate chip, pretzel, and six-cheese, which can be used as part of a breakfast sandwich or a filling lunch. Sandwiches include bacon, avocado, and turkey, chicken salad, and mixed veggies, as well as lighter options like asparagus, mushroom, and Swiss cheese on a \"bagel thin single.\" Remind me why we’re not eating all of our sandwiches on bagels? 8) Potbelly Sandwich Works Founded in Chicago in 1977, Potbelly’s popularity (and footprint) has rocketed in recent years. Sandwiches are toasted and served hot on regular or multigrain rolls, and come with classic fillings like meatballs, smoked ham, roast beef, chicken salad, and grilled chicken and Cheddar. There’s a choice of toppings, or you can ask for a \"Skinny,\" with less meat and cheese on thin-cut bread. But if you’re a first-timer, go for A Wreck: salami, roast beef, turkey, ham, and Swiss. Grab a milkshake to wash it down, snag a table near the frequent live music, and you’ll be all set. They’re also one of the few publicly traded companies on this ranking they were listed on NASDAQ in October 2013. 7) Così The original Così was actually inspired by a café in Paris, and they’re perhaps best known for their low-key café vibe, bread baked in view of customers, and s’mores for dessert. Sandwiches are served on a freshly baked white or multigrain flatbread, in creative varieties like BBQ pulled pork and Cheddar melt, Buffalo Bleu, and Tandoori Chicken. Salads are also stellar here, made fresh to order with homemade dressings, and that flatbread is pretty versatile, also being used in pizzas. 6) Jersey Mike’s Subs In business since 1956, Jersey Mike’s has been around longer than any other chain on our list, and is a true American success story. In 1975 the original Point Pleasant, N.J., shop went up for sale, and a 17-year-old employee named Peter Cancro scraped together enough money to buy it. Today there are more than 750 locations nationwide and Cancro is CEO of the company. So what’s the secret? Quality. Meats and cheeses at Jersey Mike’s are sliced to order, Angus top rounds are trimmed and cooked on-premises, and bread is baked fresh in-house daily. They’re also committed to giving to charity, generally setting aside one day per month when all proceeds are donated. 5) Schlotzsky’s To go from a small shop in Austin to an international franchise with locations in 35 states and five countries in 40 years takes commitment and a little luck, and for Schlotzsky’s that lucky break came in the form of an invention that blew away those who tried it in the early days: smoked ham, Genoa and cotto salamis, melted Cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses, black olives, red onion, lettuce, tomato, mustard, and dressing on a toasted sourdough bun, also known as The Original. More than 25 additional varieties of sandwiches have joined it on the menu since then, including Angus beef and provolone, chicken and pesto, and a turkey bacon club, along with pizzas, salads, and soups, but it’s still that Original that’s one of the finest sandwiches you’re bound to find anywhere. 4) Quiznos Subs Quiznos was the first major chain to really play up the \"toasted\" factor, and even though it might seem like a no-brainer these days, that’s only because everyone else has jumped on the bandwagon. The second-largest sub chain in America behind Subway, with more than 4,000 U.S. locations and hundreds more around the world, it started with a single shop in Denver and a pizza oven from a local Tombstone. Today, they offer sandwiches with steak, chicken, turkey, and deli meats, in varieties like Pesto Caesar, Baja, Mesquite, Carbonara (with Alfredo sauce), and The Traditional, with turkey, ham, roast beef, Cheddar, olives, lettuce, tomato, onions, and ranch. Breads include white, wheat, rosemary Parmesan, jalapeño Cheddar, or flatbread, and they’ll also not toast it for you if you ask nicely. 3) Jimmy John’s Gourmet Sandwiches With about 200 units opening every year for the past few years, Jimmy John’s, founded in an Illinois garage in 1983 by Jimmy John Liautaud, is on a path to world domination, and that’s fine by us. Bread is baked in-house daily and served fresh, and ingredients are as high-quality as possible: \"The turkey is real turkey, the roast beef is real roast beef — no additives, no vegetable-based fillers, no fake stuff,\" the website claims. Sandwiches are composed with an eye toward balance, but if you want to go big, go for the J.J. Gargantuan: Genoa salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey, provolone, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and homemade Italian dressing on a French bun. Now that’s a sandwich. 2) Subway Subway may very well be the reigning king of fast-food style sandwich chains, with 40,445 locations in 103 countries as of October 2013, but that wasn’t enough to make it to number on our list. Most people smell Subway before they see it, a result of the bread baking, and its backlit sign and fluorescent lighting is instantly recognizable the world over. Founded by two friends in Bridgeport, Conn., in 1965, the chain exploded out of the gate and today has more locations than even McDonald’s. They change with the times (rolling out flatbreads, breakfast, chopped salads, and even personal pizzas), but at its core it’s all about the subs, made with expert precision. Like all fast-food brands, there’s something almost comforting about the familiar sight of a Subway: you know exactly what you’re going to get, and it’ll taste just like it always has. 1) Panera Bread With 46 percent of respondents voting for Panera Bread as one of their favorites, the fast-casual chain was the runaway winner, with more than 150 more votes than number two on our list. Panera, originally called the St. Louis Bread Company, was a spin-off of Au Bon Pain, but was such a success that Au Bon Pain sold itself out and renamed itself Panera Bread. There are more than 1,700 \"Bakery-Cafes\" in 44 states, and 20 facilities delivering fresh dough to each location daily so it can be baked on-premises. The first chain to voluntarily post calorie counts on its menus and one of the nation’s largest providers of free Wi-Fi, Panera has consistently been ahead of the curve when it comes to dining trends. They offer comfortable seating, a wide menu that’s constantly being updated with seasonal specials, and breakfast items, salads, pasta, soups, and pastries as well as expertly prepared sandwiches that can be customized to order. Not only does Panera have legions of fans, many are nothing short of obsessed with it. So congratulations on being America’s best chain sandwich shop, Panera, and keep up the good work!

              "  'context': 'More like Grandpa-lpatine. The conclusion of Star Wars: The Force Awakens left us all with one question: Who are Rey’s parents? While many people believed the final shot was a clue to Rey being a Skywalker, there were just as many theories that she was a Kenobi, or someone totally unrelated to previous characters from the series. But a new theory has awakened: that Rey is in fact Emperor Palpatine’s granddaughter. YouTuber Vincent Vendetta uploaded a video compiling the evidence to support this theory, and honestly it’s pretty compelling. There’s the matter of their fighting styles. Both Rey and Palpatine are the only two characters in the Star Wars universe who use this forward-thrust move. This mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust. Rey’s first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to Palpatine’s fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental. This cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of Skywalker vs Palpatine tension. In The Force Awakens, if Rey’s parentage does stem from Palpatine, her battle against Kylo Ren continues the Skywalker/Palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides. For now. That’s because Rey is already struggling with the pull of the dark side. While every fledgling Jedi struggles between the pull of light and dark, there are moments during The Force Awakens that point to Rey being tempted to the dark. In the film’s script, it describes Rey as \"standing on the edge of the dark side\". During Rey’s vision, Palpatine can be heard several times. Right before the hallway collapses on her, you can hear Palpatine’s scream, and further along, there’s audio of Palpatine saying \"any Jedi\". There are a few other audio snippets included (Luke, Obi-Wan, and Yoda to name a few) but Palpatine’s inclusion seems like an outlier when you consider Luke’s lightsaber is the trigger for the vision. Why else would ol’ Palps show up, if not because of some kind of relationship to Rey? The notion of hiding in plain sight comes into play when you consider the poster for The Force Awakens. In the portrait form, Rey’s strategic placement puts her between the dark and light sides in the most literal sense. But when expanded out, Rey is placed toward the dark side, hanging with Kylo Ren, her staff aligned with his lightsaber to almost seem as if they’re one. Finally, what about the accent? A lot of people used Rey’s British accent as evidence that she could be a Kenobi, but guess who else had a fancy posh accent. Yep. Palpatine. There’s even more compelling evidence when you take into account clues from the film’s script, the accompanying novel, and other hints from the film.

Beijing has been dumping U.S. government debt to prop up its currency. China uses the dollars it gets from selling U.S. Treasuries to buy the yuan, which has sunk to an 8-year low as the world\\'s second largest economy slows. China\\'s huge holdings of U.S. debt fell to $1.12 trillion at the end of October, their lowest level in more than six years, according to U.S. Treasury Department data. Japan held $1.13 trillion. Both countries offloaded Treasuries during the month, but China dumped far more: its holdings dropped by $41.3 billion, while Japan\\'s fell by just $4.5 billion. China\\'s willingness to lend vast sums to the U.S. government has drawn a lot of attention in recent years. Since September 2008, the Treasury Department has ranked it as the biggest foreign creditor to the U.S., with the exception of one month in early 2015 and again with its latest update. The situation has raised concerns about Beijing\\'s leverage over the United States. President-elect Donald Trump has claimed the opposite, suggesting it gives the United States \"a lot of power\" over China. Experts say the reality is more complicated, arguing that the debt relationship binds the world\\'s two largest economies closely together. Trump has suggested he will take a more confrontational stance toward China on trade, threatening to slap tariffs of as much as 45% on Chinese goods. For years, China spent trillions of yuan buying Treasuries as a way of stopping its currency from getting too strong even as its economy grew rapidly. That made China\\'s exports more competitive, but it also helped to keep interest rates in the U.S. lower than they would have been. But as China\\'s economy has slowed in recent years, huge sums of money have been flowing out of the country, putting downward pressure on the yuan. The surge in the dollar since Trump\\'s election victory has piled on the pressure. Beijing has been selling some of its enormous stockpile of foreign exchange reserves, much of it U.S. government debt, in order to buy yuan. It wants to avoid a repeat of the sudden plunges in the currency that panicked markets in August 2015 and January 2016.

              "  'context': 'Many people suffer declining eyesight as they get older, but is there something we can eat to improve it, asks Michael Mosley. My eyesight has never been good. I\\'ve worn glasses most of my life and as I get older that\\'s a situation that I\\'ve only expected to get worse. When the Trust Me, I\\'m A Doctor team suggested that I try taking supplements to improve my eyesight, though, I was sceptical, particularly as I am not a fan of supplements. Nonetheless I headed off to meet Prof John Barbur of City University in London to have my eyesight thoroughly tested. He was particularly interested in my retina, the light sensitive part of the eye, and made me stare at a computer screen in the dark for hours, having tests flashed up at me which thoroughly and precisely measured the limitations of my perception of different colours, my night vision and my detection of faint and small objects. He also measured the level of protection that the most delicate area of my retina - the macula - had against damage from high energy blue and UV light. This protection is, in effect, a kind of natural sunscreen that we have covering the light-detecting cells, and is made up of yellowish \"macular pigments\". The results of my tests were both fascinating and depressing. My detection of yellow and blue colours was extremely poor - something that Prof Barbur said was likely the result of my brush with diabetes many years ago. My night vision and perception of details were also poor compared with younger people - but consistent with my age. The Trust Me team then handed me a 90-day supply of supplement pills that were supposed to help. They contained concentrations of certain compounds found in coloured plants. These were extracted from marigolds, but two of the key chemicals - lutein and zeaxanthin - are also found in a range of things we eat more commonly. Find out more Michael Mosley (left, above) presents Trust Me, I\\'m A Doctor which is on Thursday 8 September on BBC Two at 20:00 BST - catch up on BBC iPlayer A team in the United States devised a recipe for a daily smoothie for us that they hoped could supply a similar level of lutein and zeaxanthin. It was a heady mix of fruits and veg such as kale and kiwi fruit, along with fats such as milk and wheat germ oil which help the absorption of the key compounds. Twelve weeks later, I returned to City University to see whether my daily pill-popping had made any difference to my eyesight. The results surprised even Prof Barbur. There were significant improvements in several different aspects - my blue and yellow colour perception was back to normal and my night vision was much better. The levels of my protective macular pigments were also boosted. The results were less of a surprise to Prof John Nolan, who I went to meet in Waterford, in south-east Ireland. His team has been studying macular pigments for many years, and recently completed a year-long trial with over 100 participants in which they had seen similar results to mine. They found that boosting the diet with the three macular pigments - lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin - led to significant improvements in the protection of the delicate macula, as well as improved eyesight. There is also some evidence that such supplementation may help slow or possibly even prevent, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the leading cause of vision loss in the UK. However, this is still controversial. Should we all, then, be taking supplements to protect and even improve our eyesight? Image copyright Reuters Image caption It\\'s a good idea to eat kale Well, the research certainly shows that supplements work. Even for someone like me, who has a relatively healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, and whose blood levels of the compounds that weren\\'t particularly low, the supplements helped. However, some researchers believe that diet can simply be enough, if we eat the right things. More research needs to be done on the best dietary sources for each of the three macular pigments. Lutein is a yellow compound made only by plants. They make it in order to absorb blue light, as part of their mechanism to capture energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. Animals then get it from eating plants - good sources are green kale and spinach, or the yellow yolks of eggs. It is used as a supplement to feed industrially-reared chickens to make their yolks a more attractive yellow (and, being fat-soluble, ends up turning their skin and fat yellow too). Zeaxanthin is another yellow compound, almost identical to lutein, made by plants to absorb light. It is the chemical that gives corn, bell peppers and saffron their yellow colour. Meso-zeaxanthin is a form of zeaxanthin not generally found in plants, but it is made in the body from lutein. More research needs to be done on how efficient this process is. It is found in some fish (particularly in the skins), but in supplements containing marigold extract, it appears that the industrial processing that the marigolds undergo can create meso-zeaxanthin (and it has been found to be in some marigold-extract supplements, even when not listed on the label). Our volunteers taking the smoothie containing amounts of plant sources calculated to give them a boost of lutein and zeaxanthin did indeed boost their lutein levels, but not their zeaxanthin. Clearly more work needs to be done to refine the recipe. So, this might be a rare occasion where, given the current state of research, I might end up on the side of supplements - especially for those who don\\'t eat as many leafy greens as they should, and for older people (who absorb nutrients less efficiently). However, for all of those whose mothers and grandmothers told them that carrots would improve their vision the message is this - although lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin are all chemicals known as \"carotenoids\", and carrots do owe the yellow portion of their colour to them, these particular key compounds are found mainly in the green parts of plants above ground. So, if you want to improve your eyesight, I\\'m afraid it\\'s munching on leafy greens (taken with some fats to help absorb these fat-soluble chemicals) that will do the best job.

If you choose to activate iCloud Photo Library, your iPhone will by default keep big, high-resolution files both on your device and on iCloud. But here’s where the storage-saving trick comes in: You can set the iCloud Photo Library to upload the higher-resolution files to the cloud and keep only compressed (read: smaller) versions on your iPhone. Those compressed versions are still good enough to show off your photos to family and friends on your iPhone screen, but they take up much less space on your device — leaving you free to take more photos and videos. To turn on the iCloud Photo Library on your iPhone or iPad, first make sure you’ve got the latest iOS 8.1 update installed and that you’re signed up for iCloud.

Something that changes how we’re looking at extinction, preservation, and food storage, as well as how humans have influenced the planet in their time on it.

They\\'re nice to read, and then you move on with your day because you have a whole different set of problems than what those people have.\" The first of those problems is that saving is generally a complicated business, especially if you came of age during the Great Recession, says Dang: \"Wages were stagnant, but the amount of debt we were accruing after college was skyrocketing.\" Housing costs, healthcare, and student loans have risen since, so many young people are financially stretched as it is: \"There are all these expenses you need to think about, then your savings, then retirement.\" Let\\'s say you could clear all your outstanding debts, cut down on housing costs through living at your parents\\' house, and taking a second job freelancing part-time (or selling weed). In that case you could stop working once you had around a million dollars. As certified financial planner Sofia Bera explains to me, \"People who have a ton of money don\\'t need to invest for growth—they just need a big enough sum to generate enough income on a yearly basis,\" through payouts on investments. For retirees of any age, the idea is to have enough of a nest egg built up to the point that you can expect to draw a \"salary\" from your investments while still adding enough to weather inflation rates. \"That can work out really well if you only need two or three percent a year in dividends in order to withdraw from your portfolio,\" Bera says. Once you hit that million-dollar figure, you\\'re able to turn your money into a perpetual money-making machine that you can theoretically live off of—that is, if you make some life adjustments. Judging off the yields Bera suggests, you\\'d be able to take $20,000 to $30,000 per year from your fund—enough to live sustainably in any of the lowest-income places in the United States. Regardless, you really should start saving some money for retirement. Even a small amount can make a big difference over a number of years. (Here\\'s a primer to get you started.) As for how much you\\'ll need: Dang says that when people ask him this question, \"I always tell them to think about how they want to live their lives.\" Some might decide to work well into advanced age as a way to keep themselves occupied while providing themselves with a bit of income; others might want to spend their twilight years having fun or using their decades of sexual experience to do weird sex stuff (and potentially get a couple STI\\'s). The point is, even if the world suffers some sort of cataclysmic event that turns society into The Road Warrior, you\\'ll still need some savings to get by—if only to buy up all the weapons and gasoline you\\'ll need to become a post-apocalyptic pirate ruler. So get started, because the magic of compounding is real. How Much Money Would You Need to Retire Right Now?',\n",

              "  'context': 'By the time you\\'ve hit 40, you should have a solid handle on your finances. This is especially true for matters related to retirement, since your golden years are fast approaching. To be financially ready to retire by 67, retirement-plan provider Fidelity Investments says you should aim to have six times your salary saved by age 50 . Are Americans on track? According to a report from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), the mean retirement savings of a family between 44 and 49 years old is $81,347: But that number doesn\\'t tell the whole story. Since so many families have zero savings and since super-savers can pull up the average, the median savings, or those at the 50th percentile, may be a better gauge. The median for families between 44 and 49 is only $6,200. To get closer to Fidelity\\'s recommendation of having six times your salary saved by 50, follow these four steps so your money can grow over time: 1. Contribute as much of your income as possible. Most experts recommend setting aside 10% or more in a tax-advantaged retirement savings account, such as a 401(k) plan . 2. Automate your contributions. Have your employer do a payroll deduction or have your money taken out of your checking account and sent straight to your retirement account. You\\'ll never see the money and will learn to live without it. 3. Get in the habit of upping your savings consistently, either every six months, at the end of each year or whenever you get a raise. Again, if you make this automatic by setting up \"auto-increase,\" you won\\'t forget to up your contributions (or talk yourself out of setting aside a larger chunk). 4. Invest in something other than your retirement-savings plan. Enrolling in your employer\\'s 401(k) plan is a good start, but experts say that it may not provide enough to fund your future. It\\'s smart to consider alternate retirement savings accounts, such as a Roth IRA , traditional IRA and/or health savings account . You can also research low-cost index funds , which Warren Buffett recommends, and online-investment platforms known as robo-advisers .

Researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School found an association between regularly eating peanut butter and having a lower risk of developing benign breast disease in early adulthood. Benign breast disease is noncancerous, and occurs when there are changes to the breast or an injury or infection leads to lumps in the breast tissue. The research team did not investigate a link between peanut butter and malignant breast lumps or cancer. Other sources of vegetable fats and proteins -- such as soybeans, beans and lentils -- could also have the same effect, but researchers noted that the data on these particular foods in the study was not as abundant as data on peanut butter. It's important to note that the study only showed an association between peanut butter consumption and breast disease, and doesn't show that peanut butter can definitively prevent breast disease. The study, published in the journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, included health data on 9,039 U.S. girls ages 9 to 15 who were recruited to the Growing Up Today Study in 1996. They filled out food-frequency questionnaires once a year from their recruitment year until 2001, and then biennially until 2010. In 2005, researchers also started keeping track of benign breast disease diagnoses among the study participants, who had entered adulthood and were now between ages 18 and 30. Researchers found that 112 of them had developed the condition. Researchers found that eating peanut butter twice a week during childhood/adolescences was linked with a 39 percent lower risk of developing benign breast disease, and this effect seemed especially strong among girls who had a family history of breast cancer.

              "  'context': 'In a world overrun by crazy restrictive diets, miserable juice plans, and weight loss pills, it\\'s easy to forget about one simple concept: portion control. But new research shows that making this one change—paying more attention to how much you eat rather than what you eat—is the gold standard if you want to lose weight. In fact, scientists at Cambridge University in the UK have found that cutting back on serving size alone can help Americans eat an average of 527 fewer calories per day, resulting in a weight loss of about one pound per week.  Researchers crunched the numbers on more than 60 studies on food intake and found that increasing portion sizes have caused us all to eat more, regardless of our gender, hunger levels, how thin or fat we are, or our amount of self-reported willpower. In particular, they found that supersized portions can add more than 500 calories to each of our plates every day, which has only helped to make us fatter and fatter.  \"The message is that, however it happens, reducing the amounts of food that end up in front of us in the first place is key [to weight loss],\" says Gareth Hollands, PhD, senior research associate at Cambridge University School of Clinical Medicine and coauthor of the paper. But there\\'s one big problem: The first and only step of portion control—eat less—is notoriously difficult to do. So how do you accomplish the feat? Here are the top meal-reshaping, fat-blasting tips from Lisa Young, PhD, author of The Portion Teller. 1. Forget about portions when you eat out, because restaurants are notorious for serving oversize meals. Resolve before you even walk into a restaurant to split an entrée, supplementing with a salad or veggie side dish. Avoid all-you-can-eat deals, and wait to have your cocktail until after your meal, since alcohol is proven to trigger overeating. 2. Downsize your plates and glasses to smaller tableware, which will go a long way in reducing how much food ends up on your plate.  3. Most of us are serving ourselves too much food without even realizing it. Learn what an appropriate portion size looks like by using this handy visual guide.  4. Fill half your plate with low-calorie, fiber-rich fruits and veggies that aren\\'t dripping in butter or cream sauce (herbs and spices are your friends!), using one-quarter of your plate for a lean protein and the final quarter for a whole grain like brown rice. (Lose up to 15 pounds WITHOUT dieting with Eat Clean to Get Lean, our 21-day clean-eating meal plan.) 5. Plate your meal in the kitchen and keep serving dishes there so that you\\'re forced to get up for seconds rather than simply reaching across the table.

Pokemon has been around for what seems like forever, well actually 20 years now. For some of you readers, Pokemon may have been around since before you were born, which makes me feel even older considering I played link-battles on the school bus with my friends.

With Nintendo\\'s attempt to unify game releases in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan the games are going to be released in both traditional and simplified Chinese. This may not seem like a big deal, but until now differences in culture and dialect have spawned a variety of translations. This is going to change with Sun and Moon and as reported by Zheping Huang in Quartz, this is what we\\'ll see: Now Nintendo wants to unify them: Pokémon in Greater China will be officially called 精靈寶可夢, or Jingling Baokemeng in Mandarin (Jingling means \"spirit\" or \"elf,\" and Baokemeng is a transliteration of Pokémon).

This probably makes sense if you live in any area with a singular dialect, but when you\\'re trying to make one unified language version of a game to an area that has several unique dialects there are bound to be some twists. Hong Kong is where one of these twists can be found - Hong Kong being where the common language has always been Cantonese, rather than Mandarin.

              "  'context': 'WASHINGTON -- When your opponents\\' legislative style bears frequent comparison to the antics of angry toddlers, perhaps what\\'s needed is a lead negotiator with a schoolteacher mentality and a knack for discipline. Democrats think they may have that in Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who so famously sticks to the script that reporters are tempted to call her boring. She happens to have started her career wrangling obstreperous children -- which turns out to have been excellent preparation for the details-oriented approach that Murray has adopted in politics and that she intends to bring to the high-stakes budget negotiations that began last week with Republicans and continue Wednesday. \"I taught preschool,\" Murray told The Huffington Post in an interview in her Capitol Hill office this week. \"You don\\'t walk into a class with 4-year-olds without a direction of where you\\'re going to go.\" Murray most certainly has a plan for the budget conference with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). It boils down to offering various compromises and seeing if Republicans are willing to bite after their disastrous, poll-punished bid to defund Obamacare by shutting down the government. \"I look at this as the Republican opportunity to stand up and show there can be adults in their party and help our country find compromise and move us forward as a country,\" Murray said. \"If they opt not to do that, and this budget conference ends up in the same place with no resolution, I think it\\'s going to hurt them in the long run. I think there are more of them that see that, and I\\'m hopeful they stand up.\" The conference committee aims to find ways to replace the sequestration budget cuts that Congress\\' last failed negotiations left, and to hash out ways to fund the government after the current stopgap bill expires Jan. 15 and to raise the debt ceiling after Feb. 7. To get there, Murray is offering a menu of items that Democrats don\\'t like, but have been willing to swallow, if Ryan and company will compromise. Among the proposals are some $350 billion in entitlement cuts spelled out in the budget the Senate passed in March. Her iron rule is that Republicans get nothing if they are not willing to give something in the way of raising revenue. And replacing the sequester cannot mean simply boosting defense and cutting domestic programs. \"First of all, it\\'s going to be defense and non-defense. There\\'s going to be revenue that is part of the package, and then if there\\'s revenue, that will kind of outline what we\\'re willing to give in terms of spending cuts,\" Murray said. \"We\\'re not going to cut Medicare and impact benefits for seniors to replace defense cuts,\" she added. \"I don\\'t think the country would back that. We are going to look and are willing to look at a series of things that we can do on the cutting side.\" She said cuts wouldn\\'t include yoking Social Security payments to so-called chained CPI -- changing the way inflation is measured so that benefits grow more slowly than under the current inflation index. Ryan offered no concessions when he sat down next to Murray for the first conference committee meeting, saying Democrats had better forget about trying to raise revenue as part of the solution to America\\'s debt problems. \"I want to say this from the get-go: If this conference becomes an argument about taxes, we’re not going to get anywhere,\" said Ryan. He exuded a certain type of charm and confidence as he opened the talks, appearing unchastened by the government shutdown debacle. \"You’ll notice there are three senators for every congressman -- so as we see it, that\\'s an even match,\" Ryan joked. \"I like to think quality beats quantity.\" Murray stuck to her script and made no jokes when it was her turn to speak. But the diminutive grandmother, somewhat dwarfed by the former vice presidential nominee, likely agreed with his quip -- at least the part about brains trumping bulk. And she thinks the smart thing for Republicans to do is, well, stop being babies. \"I think the Republicans have to sit back and say, \\'Do we want to be part of that governing party system and compromise system, or do we want to be the group in the corner that yells and screams?\\' \" Murray said. \"That\\'s what caused the government shutdown, the -- I\\'m sorry, I used to teach preschool -- the temper tantrum on the floor, to show how somehow they are powerful.\" The question of power is an interesting one for Murray. She cuts such an unassuming figure that it\\'s easy to underestimate her. But she comes off a 2012 election cycle in which she shepherded the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to improbable wins. She\\'s also the fourth-ranking member of the Senate leadership, making her arguably the most powerful elected woman in politics. And in the context of budget talks, she\\'s almost a direct extension of Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Aides, who spoke anonymously because they did not have permission to talk about the personal relationship, said Murray has near-carte blanche from Reid because they are on the same page philosophically about the budget. \"When they talk about this stuff, they finish each other\\'s sentences,\" one aide said. That authority was on display in the late days of the government shutdown, when Democrats showed signs of caving. A plan introduced by Republican Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) was gathering steam among red state Democrats and eventually won the backing of seven Democrats. The plan was built on the premise that for Republicans, it was a concession to reopen the government and raise the borrowing cap. It asked Democrats to accept a two-year delay of Obamacare\\'s medical device tax, and to lock in sequester cuts for six months. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) threw his support behind the plan, but on the Saturday before the shutdown ended -- a critical day of negotiations -- Murray shut it down. A Democratic leadership aide said that during a closed-door meeting, Murray beseeched her colleagues not to force the country into six more months of meat-ax sequester cuts. Such a move would also weaken her hand in upcoming budget negotiations, she argued. Democrats emerging from that meeting said her plea won the day. \"Patty Murray makes a very important point,\" Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said after the meeting. \"If she is bound going into a budget conference by the Paul Ryan number, where is her bargaining power? Some Senate Republicans were insisting on that. But that’s unfair.\" Murray marched over to Collins on the Senate floor to deliver the answer herself. \"It was cordial.

But with Murray as the calm, reasonable-seeming face of the Democratic position, the stakes may actually be higher for the GOP, whatever Ryan\\'s smarmy opening joke may have suggested. \"I think there are a lot of people praying that we do our jobs, which is compromise,\" Murray said. \"If the Republicans choose not to and say no revenue, not a dime, nothing, I think that they will feel the backlash and I think many of them will realize that.\" And while she said she believes Republicans would again pay the price for another showdown, Murray insisted she\\'d prefer a deal. \"I\\'m a Democrat. I want Democrats to be in the majority, I want to us to be the party that sets the priorities -- I\\'m all for that,\" she said. \"But we also need a strong Republican Party of good people, who come here, who passionately care for things but are also willing to sit down and compromise.

This is because Astley didn’t write the song, so he only receives a performer’s share of the sound recording copyright. Astley doesn’t seem to have any hard feelings about rickrolling. \"Listen, I just think it’s bizarre and funny. My main consideration is that my daughter doesn’t get embarrassed about it.\" And despite the prevalence of the meme, he has no plans to remix or re-release the song to cash in on the phenomenon. \"I don’t really know whether I want to be doing that,\" he said. \"I’m not being an ageist, but it’s almost a young person’s thing, that.

              "  'context': 'From the first time they placed my swaddled, newborn baby into my arms, until now, 28 years later, there was always something more I wanted to do for my daughter, something more I wanted to give her. Never did that list include breast cancer. Whitney was only 11 when I was diagnosed, a month before my 39th birthday. Her brother was 5 1⁄2. He was too young to understand what was happening at home then, too young to remember it now. But not my Whit. In fact, the irony didn\\'t escape me that my little girl was in the process of developing her own breasts just as I was losing mine. Soon after my bilateral mastectomy, after my breasts were removed, but before the implants were inserted, Whit and I went shopping. We were in the fitting room and when she removed her clothes to try on a shirt, she turned away from me. She was already wearing a bra, but even still, it was clear she didn\\'t want me looking at her. She hunched up her shoulders and drew her arms inward, protecting her modesty. I took this as an opportunity to joke with her a bit about the fact there was no need to be shy with me or embarrassed about her changing body. \"I\\'ve seen it all, remember? I\\'m the one who changed your diapers.\" And that\\'s when she hit me with the question: Could she see? I didn\\'t get it at first. Maybe I just didn\\'t want to get it. Or maybe I was still a little foggy from my most recent dose of chemotherapy. \"See what?\" I asked. \"Your chest,\" she replied. Oh boy. Oh. Dear. God. My breasts still bore the angry red scars from my bilateral mastectomy. I couldn\\'t stand to look at myself; how could I show her? But I\\'d just mini-lectured her about not being shy about her body and her developing breasts. Could I really be so hypocritical in all of three minutes? Also, I didn\\'t really have breasts. Under my flat chest were tissue expanders -- place holders, if you will. These devices were inserted immediately after my breasts were removed, while I was still in the operating room. The expanders were filled, a little bit at time, every few weeks, with saline solution. The ever-growing expanders were intended to stretch my skin gradually, until the region could accommodate respectable \"B\" sized breast implants (in spite of my husband\\'s not-so-subtle hint that I consider going larger). The swap-out of the tissue expanders for the implants was still many, many months away. Consequently, while I wasn\\'t as flat as a proverbial board, I was oh, so close -- and Whit wanted to see. My hands shook nervously as I slowly unbuttoned my shirt, taking care to keep myself covered. When I got to the bottom button I looked at Whitney, but we didn\\'t make eye contact. Her eyes were fixed on my still-hidden chest. \"Here you go,\" I said and quickly pulled open my shirt. As she took in my mutilated torso, with scars that hadn\\'t yet begun to fade, Whitney\\'s eyes grew large; the look on her face said it all: She was horrified. We made brief eye contact before she shifted her gaze to the floor. As I rebuttoned my shirt, I tried to think of something reassuring to say and I found myself parroting the words of my reconstructive surgeon: \"I know it doesn\\'t look so great now, but it\\'s going to be terrific in the end. I\\'ll look normal again; maybe even better than normal!\" That\\'s when the conversation shifted. \"You didn\\'t have breast cancer when you were pregnant with me, right?\" Whitney asked. I told her she was correct and she seemed relieved. Whitney then told me, well, actually, she didn\\'t tell me as much as she announced that she was not going to get breast cancer. Just as I was about to chime in with something like, \"I certainly hope not!\" she explained her thinking. \"Because you got it after you had me that means that you didn\\'t give it to me and so I can\\'t get it.\" Clearly, my burgeoning biologist had learned enough science to have a basic understanding of genetics, even if it wasn\\'t an accurate one. I knew I should set her straight, but I didn\\'t want to worry her. I also didn\\'t think that the dressing room was where I wanted to be having this conversation. But hadn\\'t I instigated all this with the \"don\\'t be shy about your body\" talk in the first place? So I felt I had no choice but to correct Whitney\\'s mistaken notion, in very broad terms, of course, as I was acutely aware that I was also giving an unasked-for genetics lesson to the moms and daughters in stalls near ours -- who simply thought they were entering the dressing room to try on clothes! After my master-class in Bio 101, I told Whitney that it was my sincere hope -- and belief -- that by the time she was old enough to worry about such things, breast cancer would be a thing of the past. That smart doctors and researchers would come up with a vaccine to prevent it from happening in the first place. \"But what if they don\\'t?\" she wanted to know. Oh God, Whitney. What if they don\\'t? But she was only 11. She had time. So much time before she needed to worry about this. This year, my daughter went for her first mammogram. The medical community recommends that young women like Whitney, \"with a history,\" begin their breast cancer screening about 10 years before their mother was first diagnosed. When Whitney called to tell me that all went well, I could hear the cheerfulness in her voice. I forced myself to mimic her tone and made some excuse about being on the way out the door and rushed her off the phone. And then I burst into uncontrollable sobs. What was wrong with me? My daughter just called to tell me she was fine. I should feel relieved, grateful, ecstatic. But. I couldn\\'t help thinking about all those hopes and dreams I had for Whitney -- all the things I wanted to give her. My heart -- the one that sits underneath those fake breasts that will never look like my originals, no matter what the reconstructive surgeon said -- quite literally ached as I thought about the legacy I\\'ve given my daughter, who is no longer a little girl, but old enough to get mammograms (!) and old enough to have to worry about the elephant in the room: What she may be sharing with her mother some day. Months have passed since Whitney\\'s first mammogram and I\\'ve had time to revise my thinking a bit. Maybe I\\'m just trying to be optimistic, but maybe the breast cancer worry I\\'ve given my daughter is a veiled blessing. Early detection still remains the very best way to save lives. So because I have already walked the walk, Whitney is being carefully screened and watched in the hope that she never has to follow in my footsteps. But if she does, it\\'s likely they\\'ll catch it early and she, like me, will survive. And that\\'s not such a terrible thing at all. Like Mother, Like Daughter?',\n",

              "  'context': 'Oklahoma, which has some of the strictest marijuana laws of any state in the nation, is considering a bill to fully legalize marijuana. The proposed law, which was introduced last week by state Sen. Constance Johnson (D-Oklahoma City), would make it legal for adults over age 21 in Oklahoma to buy, possess and consume up to an ounce of cannabis. State residents would also be allowed to grow up to five marijuana plants in a secure area at home, out of public view. The tax-and-regulate bill, which is known as Senate Bill 2116, tasks the state Department of Health with licensing growers, testing facilities and retail marijuana stores where the buds would be sold along with other marijuana products. The bill would also significantly reduce penalties for Oklahoma residents younger than 21 who are caught with under an ounce of weed. The current law allows persons under age 21 to be imprisoned for a year for possessing even a crumb of cannabis. Johnson\\'s law would instead require them to attend a drug awareness class of up to four hours in length. First offenders\\' criminal records would be kept clean. Oklahoma ranks third in the country for draconian marijuana laws, according to the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington, D.C.-based organization working to reform marijuana laws across the country. In the state, the sale of any amount of cannabis will land someone in jail for two years to life. However, the odds of the bill becoming law this year are slim. The state legislature has a history of voting down efforts to reform the state\\'s harsh pot laws, evidenced last year when it shot down a medical marijuana bill. Even if the bill made it through the state congress, Republican Gov. Mary Fallin has said she is against legalizing the drug because she believes it would lead to substance abuse and car accidents. Still, Johnson believes the tides are turning. On the phone with The Huffington Post on Tuesday, Johnson cited a poll from August and September that showed more than 71 percent of state residents supported legalizing cannabis for medical purposes. She says she just wants to raise awareness. \"I just want people to have the conversation,\" Johnson told HuffPost. \"This is about education, and it\\'s about compassion. Look what the criminalization of marijuana is doing to families. Young people in Oklahoma, 19- and 20-year-olds, go to jail for possessing marijuana. We spend taxpayer dollars to put them in private prisons. [When they get out] their lives are ruined.

The moving pictures inhabit the space between GIF and video but act more like something out of the wizarding world of Harry Potter, giving iPhone users even more of an excuse to take album upon album of pics. While social networks like Facebook, Tumblr and Google Photos supported the animated snapshots shortly after launch, photo-centric Instagram still hasn't added direct functionality well over a year afterward. We've been given plenty of new features in the meantime – some good like Snapchat-cloned Stories, some bad like photo albums – but we still can't share Live Photos.  There is a workaround, though – you'll just have to be okay with converting your pics to Boomerangs to be able to post them. We don't have true Live Photo functionality, which might have something to do with the reliance on Apple's 3D Touch to activate them, but at least your best shots can still be shared somehow.   The direct path to getting your Live Photos up on IG is to post them to your Story. It's easy – but there are a few limits to your sharing. First you have to convert your pics to Boomerangs, and you can only post Live Photos taken in the last 24 hours.   To make it happen, open your Instagram app and swipe right to access your Stories. Once you're there, resist the urge to share an update with your followers directly on the app. You have more pressing business here. Swipe up on the screen, and you'll be able to choose from the pictures in your camera roll from the last 24 hours.  Once you've selected your pic, converting it to a Boomerang is simple. All you need to do 3D Touch the screen in the exact same way you'd typically force a Live Photo into action. From there, you can post the Boomerang on your Story, send it to separate followers or even save it for later to your Camera Roll. After you do that, you can post it directly to your IG, just like any other Boomerang. I've seen other guides that claim you can use secondary apps to convert your Live Photos to videos to post on IG, but there's a major issue with that method: Instagram only allows you to post video content longer than three seconds. Live Photos are made by capturing the 1.5 seconds before and after you take the pic. That means the newly-converted videos wind up right under that three second limit.    I wanted to test a few of the apps to be sure, so I gave Lively and LP Converter a shot. They converted the Live Photos, just as advertised — but none of the videos could be uploaded to Instagram.   For now, it looks like the only way to get some semblance of a Live Photo up on IG is through Boomerang. We can still hold out hope that they'll make it onto your newsfeed someday, though – so Instagram, next time you decide to add a feature that could cause your own untimely demise, maybe give us some Live Photos along with it.

The city\\'s water supply may be contaminated by a toxin harmful to humans. Health officials for Toledo issued the advisory overnight Friday into Saturday after readings at a water treatment plant revealed an excessive amount of microcystin. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) also declared a state of emergency in Lucas County, according to the Toledo Blade. The water advisory affects about 400,000 people. While healthy adults should be able to bathe and shower without issues, residents are warned not to drink or boil the water. Boiling water contaminated with microcystin will only make the toxin more harmful. Ingestion of microcystin may cause abnormal liver function, as well as diarrhea, vomiting, numbness or dizziness. The city is also recommending that restaurants and food facilities that use tap water suspend their operations until health officials give the all clear. Officials believe the toxin stems from a harmful algal bloom in Lake Erie, one source of the city\\'s drinking water supply. Though the bloom is concentrated in the western basin near Toledo, it could affect water supplies for other cities situated near the lake. Residents of southeast Michigan who live near Toledo are also being advised not to drink the water. So far, no illnesses have been reported, according to Toledo Mayor D.

Research suggests that Americans\\' well-being has, if anything, declined since the 1950s, according to the American Psychological Association, while our consumption has only increased. \"Compared with their grandparents, today\\'s young adults have grown up with much more affluence, slightly less happiness and much greater risk of depression and assorted social pathology,\" David G. Myers, author of The American Paradox: Spiritual Hunger in an Age of Plenty, wrote in an American Psychologist article. \"Our becoming much better off over the last four decades has not been accompanied by one iota of increased subjective well-being.\" The materialistic values that consumer cultures support may be to blame. Those who pursue wealth and material possessions tend to be less satisfied and experience fewer positive emotions each day. On the other hand, research has found that life satisfaction -- surprise, surprise -- is correlated with having less materialistic values. Materialist values are linked to Type-A behavior. Are you highly ambitious and competitive? It could mean you\\'re also more materialistic. Australian research from the 1990s found materialist values and a possessions-based definition of success share common characteristics with type-A behaviors, including competitiveness and aggression. A 2008 study published in the Journal of Pacific Rim Psychology reiterated the finding that the desire to accumulate wealth and possessions is related to Type-A qualities. Money really can\\'t buy you happiness. The Beatles wisely noted that money can\\'t buy love, and we\\'d do well to remember that money can\\'t buy happiness, either. Research has shown that there is no direct correlation between income and happiness. Once our basic needs are met, wealth makes very little difference to one\\'s overall well-being and happiness. And in fact, extremely wealthy people actually suffer from higher rates of depression. \"The failure of additional wealth and consumption to help people have satisfying lives may be the most eloquent argument for reevaluating our current approach to consumption,\" the authors of Worldwatch Institute\\'s 2011 State of Consumption report wrote. Some data, however, has suggested that there could be a link between higher income and increased life satisfaction. It seems that it may not be the money itself that leads to dissatisfaction, but rather, the continual striving for greater wealth and more possessions that is linked to unhappiness. Materialism could ruin your relationships. Can money buy you love? Not so much, and according to a study published in the Journal Of Couple & Marriage Therapy, materialism is actually correlated with unhappiness in marriages. Researchers studied more than 1,700 couples to find that those in which both partners had high levels of materialism exhibited lower marital quality than couples with lower materialism scores. Previous studies have found that students with higher extrinsic, materialistic values tend to have lower-quality relationships, and to feel less connected to others. Materialistic people also typically have less pro-social and empathetic qualities, both towards others and towards the environment. Consumer cultures may breed narcissistic personalities. Some psychologists have suggested that consumer cultures may contribute to the development of narcissistic personalities and behaviors, \"by focusing individuals on the glorification of consumption,\" psychologist Tim Kasser wrote in The High Price Of Materialism. Narcissists generally act with arrogance and are deeply concerned with issues of personal adequacy, seeking power and prestige to cover for feelings of inner emptiness and low-self worth, Kasser explains. \"Narcissists\\' desire for external validation fits well with our conception of materialistic values as extrinsic and focused on others\\' praise,\" he writes. \"Thus it was not surprising to find that students with strong materialistic tendencies scored high on a standard measure of narcissism, agreeing with statements such as \\'I am more capable than other people\\' ... \\'I wish somebody would write my biography someday.\\'\" Consumerism is fueled by insecurity -- and remedied by mindfulness. Research suggests that materialistic values are fueled by insecurity. A 2002 study published in the journal Psychology and Marketing found that those who chronically doubt themselves and their own self-worth tend to be more materialistic. Consumerism -- which has been called a \"modern religion\" -- tends to capitalize on this insecurity and use it to sell products. \"In a practical sense, consumerism is a belief system and culture that promotes consuming as the path to self- and social improvement,\" Stephanie Kaza, University of Vermont Environment Professor and Buddhism practitioner, wrote in Tricycle: The Buddhist Review. \"As a dominant cultural force, consumerism offers products to address every dissatisfaction.\" So what\\'s the antidote? Mindfulness -- the focused awareness on the present moment, which can be cultivated through meditation and contemplative practice -- may be an effective remedy to empty or compulsive consumption. As beat writer and American Buddhist thinker Allen Ginsberg put it in a 1966 letter to the Washington Post: \"You own twice as much rug if you\\'re twice as aware of the rug.\" Americans are redefining success beyond money and power. Our collective definition of the American Dream is slowly starting to change from one of materialism to a more purposeful idea of what it means to live the good life. According to the 2013 LifeTwist study, only around one-quarter of Americans still believe that wealth determines success. \"Dozens of the survey’s findings reflect a new American notion of success, but perhaps none more starkly than the sentiment that Americans ranked \\'having a lot of money\\' 20th on a list of 22 possible contributors to having a successful life,\" the LifeTwist Study\\'s authors wrote in a press release. \"This sentiment mirrors the steadily rising trend ... that Americans are increasingly placing greater priority on living a fulfilling life –- in which being wealthy is not the most significant factor.\" The Psychology Of Materialism, And Why It\\'s Making You Unhappy',\n",

At the tech leader and Zen Buddhism practitioner\\'s funeral in October 2011, friends and family received a meaningful parting gift: A wooden box containing a copy of Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramhansa Yogananda\\'s spiritual memoir, a story of awakening and self-realization. \"That was the message: Actualize yourself,\" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who attended the funeral, said recently at the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt SF conference. \"If you look back at the history of Steve and that early trip to India ... He had this incredible realization that his intuition was his greatest gift,\" Benioff said. \"He needed to look at world from inside out ... His message was to look inside yourself and realize yourself.\" More and more business leaders in the tech world and beyond are following Jobs\\' lead, tapping into their intuition through meditation, a practice that\\'s been linked to lower stress levels and boosts in cognitive functioning, creativity, productivity and even empathy. Here are eight business leaders who say practicing meditation has improved their work and their lives -- and sometimes led to game-changing innovation. Marc Benioff While working at international computer technology corporation Oracle, Benioff took up meditation to manage work-related stress. He\\'s stuck with the habit ever since. \"I enjoy meditation, which I\\'ve been doing for over a decade -- probably to help relieve the stress I was going through when I was working at Oracle,\" Benioff told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2005. He gave a nod to his meditation practice again last week at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco during his discussion of Steve Jobs\\' leadership. \"Meditation is a major part of my life,\" Benioff said. \"It\\'s been that way for a couple of decades and that is something that I am in line with Steve Jobs on.\" Mark Bertolini After Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini broke his neck in a skiing accident, he spent a year taking painkillers -- until he found natural pain relief through yoga and meditation. Bertolini now practices mindfulness, which he says comes with the added benefit of better decision-making in the workplace. He introduced a 12-week mindfulness and yoga program for employees at Aetna, which he says resulted in dramatically lower stress levels and increased productivity among participants. Now he says it\\'s his mission to \"bring the mindfulness benefits that [he] brought to 34,000 employees to everyone in America.\" Jeff Weiner LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner spoke at last year\\'s Wisdom 2.0 conference about the importance of managing compassionately, something he calls his \"first principle of management.\" Weiner wrote in a 2012 LinkedIn blog that the Dalai Lama\\'s book The Art of Happiness taught him the principles of compassion and empathy, and has said that meditation can help boost compassion. The tech entrepreneur has also said that the \"single most important productivity tool\" he uses is making time in his schedule each day to clear his mind and do nothing. \"As the company grows larger ... you will require more time than ever before to just think,\" Weiner wrote in a LinkedIn blog in April. Rick Rubin Former Columbia Records president Rick Rubin practices Transcendental Meditation, sometimes with Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons. In 2011, Rubin and Simmons led a group meditation during a book talk at the New York Public Library. \"The more we can get in tune with the harmony of the planet, the more our art can benefit from that relationship,\" the music producer, who says he has practiced meditation since he was very young, told Nowness.com. \"The more you understand silence, that\\'s where the balance comes from.\" John Mackey Every business should have a higher purpose beyond maximizing profits, according to Whole Foods CEO John Mackey, author of Conscious Capitalism: Liberating The Heroic Spirit Of Business. \"My search for meaning and purpose led me into the counterculture movement of the late 1960\\'s and 1970\\'s,\" Mackey wrote in Conscious Capitalism. \"I studied Eastern philosophy and religion at the time and still practice both yoga and meditation. I studied ecology. I became a vegetarian.\" Nancy Slomowitz Nancy Slomowitz, CEO of Executive Management Associates, helped to lower her company\\'s health care costs by offering employees classes in Transcendental Meditation, a popular mindfulness practice favored by the likes of Rupert Murdoch, Russell Brand, Candy Crowley and Oprah. She\\'s been practicing it herself since she was a teenager. \"TM produced tangible, practical benefits in both their professional and personal lives,\" Slomowitz wrote in her book Work Zone Madness! Surviving and Rising Above Work Place Dysfunction. \"The workplace environment soon grew from toxic to harmonious among other positive changes. And surprisingly, the company’s cost of healthcare insurance actually went down due to a reduction in sick claims.\" Evan Williams The co-founder of Twitter\\'s first introduction to mindfulness was listening to meditation tapes by Dr. Wayne Dyer in his early 20s. It was a passing interest, he said at last year\\'s Wisdom 2.0 conference, and during his early days in tech Williams spent his time with his head down in a \"constantly computer brain mindset.\" But Williams says he came back to mindfulness after launching Twitter as a way to sustain high performance -- both his own and that of his employees. Soledad O\\'Brien CNN anchor and Starfish Media CEO Soledad O\\'Brien began practicing Transcendental Meditation at the urging of her friend, Def Jam co-founder and TM practitioner Russell Simmons. \"I appreciate very much the opportunity to take the time to focus and meditate and it allows me to experience a state of deep rest and relaxation that can be game-changing; and sometimes a life saver in a crazy world,\" O\\'Brien said during a 2012 David Lynch Foundation forum. \"It helps alleviate stress and pressure when you’re trying to balance life and being a mother.\" This Is The New Favorite Pastime Of The Business Elite (Hint: It\\'s Not Golf)',\n",

              "  'context': 'Madonna unloaded her thoughts about the presidential election, Donald Trump, ageism and her personal life in an interview with actress Elizabeth Banks for Billboard magazine published Monday. The 58-year-old pop icon said it felt like \"someone died\" after Trump defeated her preferred presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, in November. \"It felt like a \\xadcombination of the heartbreak and betrayal you feel when someone you love more than anything leaves you, and also a death,\" the singer told Billboard. \"I feel that way every morning; I wake up and say, ‘Oh, wait, Donald Trump is still the president,’ and it wasn’t a bad dream that I had.\" \"It feels like women betrayed us. The percentage of women who voted for Trump was insanely high,\" she added, joining others who have criticized other women for voting for Trump, including actress Lena Dunham. Madonna’s interview with Banks occurred just before her raunchy charity fundraiser in Miami, Florida but nearly a month after the presidential election. \"Women hate women. Women’s nature is not to support other women. It’s really sad,\" the \"Material Girl\" said. Madonna’s support for Clinton was no secret. The singer had promised to perform oral sex on anyone who had voted for the Democratic presidential candidate. Just days before Election Day, Madonna implored her 8.3 million Instagram followers to \"vote Clinton or we are all F*CKED.\" She believes women failed to vote for Hillary out of \"jealousy\" and \"some sort of tribal inability to accept that one of their kind could lead a nation.\" \"Other people just didn’t bother to vote because they didn’t like either candidate, or they didn’t think Trump had a chance in the world,\" Madonna said. \"They took their hands off the wheel and then the car crashed.\" The election results left Madonna \"devastated, surprised, in shock,\" she said, adding: \"I haven’t really had a good night’s sleep since he has been elected. We’re f*cked.\" The singer said she met Trump 20 years ago during a photo shoot at the President-elect’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. \"He’s a very friendly guy, \\xadcharismatic in that \\xadboastful, macho, alpha-male way,\" Madonna said of meeting Trump. \"I found his political incorrectness amusing.

We can no longer criticize other governments, other leaders.

              "  'context': 'Restaurateur Amy Morton is no stranger to the culinary world. The business, she said, chose her, not the other way around. The daughter of Morton\\'s The Steakhouse founder Arnie Morton, she was practically raised in the restaurant industry. She wasn\\'t even 30 years old when, in 1989, she opened a popular restaurant called Mirador in Chicago\\'s Old Town neighborhood. Mirador was celebrated by food critics and diners alike -- so much so that the restaurant and its connected lounge, The Blue Room, were frequently packed. But it wasn\\'t long before Morton realized that something was missing. \"We\\'d have the busiest days [at Mirador], and I\\'d look out at the dining room and sit there and just feel empty,\" Morton told The Huffington Post. \"I was not a terribly pleasant person. I was really rough on people and had the shortest fuse and lost my temper. I didn\\'t like who that was. I was not happy.\" One day, somebody knocked on Mirador\\'s door and asked to buy the space. Morton knew she\\'d found her way out. The restaurant closed in 1993, and she decided to start over. Though she continued to work in the restaurant industry as a way to pay the bills -- she founded her own consulting firm and later worked as director of operations for a restaurant group -- her path to self-discovery became a central focus. She said it all started \"accidentally\" with a trip to visit friends in Thailand. That trip, she said, was \"just like aha after aha after aha\" and sparked an interest in Buddhism. From there, Morton took up regular meditation and participated in a four-year program with the Florida-based Barbara Brennan School of Healing. She also tried Landmark Education after her friend Chicago restaurateur Gordon Sinclair \"sort of opened the window\" on that self-help training program, which claims to improve the lives of its participants and counts Lululemon founder Chip Wilson among its most ardent supporters. Slowly, she said, everything \"clicked into place.\" \"Along this path, another side of myself that had always existed became much more prevalent,\" she said. In the years that followed, Morton met her husband, Neal, and had three daughters. Her father passed away in 2005. And in November 2012, she opened her new restaurant -- Found Kitchen and Social House, just north of Chicago in Evanston, Ill. -- to more acclaim and high demand. Earlier this year, she begrudgingly began allowing reservations because waiting times were growing so long. \"I always wanted Found to be a place people could walk into, but our clientele really wanted this,\" she said, noting that the restaurant still holds some \"neighborhood tables\" for walk-in diners. \"I feel like listening is important.\" Morton, now 50, came to the realization that she wanted to open another restaurant five years prior to establishing Found, but she knew she shouldn\\'t rush the process. She attributes the delay to the ongoing process of coming to better terms with her inner self, working past self-doubt and second-guessing. \"It was a process of me finding myself,\" she said of the restaurant\\'s concept developing into a reality. \"Eventually, I figured out that even if it failed, I had to try it. I would be more regretful not having tried it even if it failed because I\\'d always be wondering.\" Morton\\'s new business is a direct reflection of the lessons she learned along her personal journey. The restaurant focuses on rustic New American dishes, served in a \"relaxed, creative\" atmosphere that is \"inspired by 1920s Bohemian Paris and icons of the Beat Generation\" and furnished with almost entirely \"salvaged\" furniture and decor, according to its website. Found chef Nicole Pederson relies on locally sourced, in-season ingredients whenever possible. Inside the dining room at Found. But Found has a mission beyond serving great food. The restaurant runs a pop-up \"Moveable Feast\" dinner series that benefits a different local charity each month and offers its space at cost for nonprofit groups to use every first Monday of the month. Morton, who serves on the board of the Evanston-based nonprofit Connections for the Homeless, also makes it a point to hire and train individuals coming out of homelessness. While the initiative has had \"a couple unbelievable success stories just in this short time that have been worth everything,\" she acknowledged there have been some struggles, too. \"Most of the time our hires haven\\'t worked out for various reasons, and that\\'s really frustrating, too,\" Morton said. \"It\\'s heartbreaking when I can\\'t hire people, people who I know really need a job but I know it\\'s not going to be a right fit. It\\'s still a business and not a social service agency.\" In an effort that might help address that problem, Morton is involved in early conversations around establishing a culinary arts training school in Evanston that would be focused on \"serving a more marginalized population.\" Though Found is already a commercial success -- which she is \"incredibly proud of\" -- Morton said she still yearns for success in a different sense. \"I feel so much more needs to be done,\" she said. \"It\\'s wonderful feeding people, but there is a difference between feeding people of wealth and working with people who need that steppingstone to living a more independent life. Every day, I try to bridge that gap. To me, making a difference is the defining thing.\" Why This Restaurateur Gave It All Up To Find Happiness',\n",

              "  'context': 'Albany Police Department officers salute during a ceremony as names are added to the New York State Police Officers’ Memorial. (Mike Groll/AP) In many states, extra punishment is meted out to those who commit crimes against others because of their race or religion. Such hate-crime laws elevate the heinousness of crimes in which people are targeted because of their identity, their belonging to a group. While hate-crime laws often refer to ethnicity or disability or gender, Louisiana is about to do something different. The state is poised to become the first in the nation where public-safety personnel will be a protected class under hate-crime law — a move that comes amid a simmering national debate about police shootings and whether that debate has given rise to an anti-law-enforcement climate. The Louisiana legislation has been referred to as \"Blue Lives Matter\" — a phrase popularized in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, which exploded following the fatal 2014 police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo. [Police officers experience fewer deaths these days — but increased tension] Black Lives Matter activists have protested what they deem as excessive force by police, and they have called attention to specific instances in which police shot unarmed civilians. But those who respond with \"Blue Lives Matter\" argue it’s officers who are under assault — that criticism of police fosters animosity toward law enforcement. In Louisiana, there were eight line-of-duty deaths among law-enforcement officers in 2015, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. Louisiana House Bill 953 faced little opposition from lawmakers; the House passed it 91 to 0, and the state Senate approved it 33 to 3. The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), the son of a sheriff who has indicated that he plans to sign HB 953 into law. Some states have floated proposals similar to the Louisiana legislation, and a bill proposed in Congress would amend federal hate-crime law to include officers as a protected class. \"Talking heads on television and inflammatory rhetoric on social media are inciting acts of hatred and violence toward our nation’s peace officers,\" Chuck Canterbury, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said in a statement. \"Our members are increasingly under fire by individuals motivated by nothing more than a desire to kill or injure a cop.\" In 2015, 124 officers died in the line of duty, according to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund. The number of officers fatally shot declined, falling to 42 from 49 a year earlier, while the overall number of deaths increased because of more traffic accidents and job-related illnesses.Fatal shootings of officers has decreased over the previous few decades — from an average of 127 in the 1970s to 57 yearly between 2000 and 2009. But many officers and their relatives have said they feel greater tension with the increased attention to fatal shootings by police. Louisiana state Rep. Lance Harris (R), who authored the hate-crime bill, has pointed to high-profile cases in arguing for his bill. According to the Advocate, Louisiana’s largest daily newspaper, Harris cited the brazen and deadly ambush of two New York police officers in December of 2014 and a drive-by shooting that wounded a firefighter that same month in Florida. \"We have a pretty extensive hate-crime law right now, but I believe we should add firefighters and policemen,\" Harris said, according to the Advocate. [Washington Post database of police shootings] No other state includes police officers as a protected class under hate-crime laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But at least 37 states — including Louisiana — have enhanced penalties for assaulting police officers. In some states, hurting a police officer can be an \"aggravating factor\" to an assault or battery charge. And in many states, killing a police officer can be an aggravating factor or circumstance, making it a crime eligible for the death penalty. Edwards, the Louisiana governor, is expected to sign the \"Blue Lives Matter\" bill this week. According to the Advertiser, the Edwards family \"has produced four generations of Tangipahoa Parish sheriffs,\" including current Sheriff Daniel Edward, the governor’s brother. [Ferguson activist accused of prostituting a 17-year-old girl] \"As the son and brother of a sheriff, I have the greatest respect for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect our communities, state and nation,\" Edwards said in a statement. \"Police officers and firefighters often perform life-saving acts of heroism, oftentimes under very dangerous circumstances, and are integral in maintaining order and civility in our society. \"The members of the law enforcement community deserve these protections, and I look forward to signing this bill into law.\" There has been criticism of the measure outside of the state Capitol. The New Orleans chapter of activist group Black Youth Project 100 has called on Edwards to veto HB 953, arguing that citizens, not police, are under assault. [Black Lives Matter and America’s long history of resisting civil rights protesters] \"By treating the police as specialized citizens held above criticism and the laws they are charged to enforce, we lose our ability to exercise our First Amendment right,\" the organization said in a statement. \"Including ‘police’ as a protected class in hate crime legislation would serve to provide more protection to an institution that is statistically proven to be racist in action, policy, and impact.\" The organization highlighted high-profile deaths of civilians in Louisiana, including that of a handcuffed Victor White III. Officials in 2014 said the 22-year-old shot himself with a gun while in the back seat of an Iberia Parish sheriff’s deputy’s car. The regional director of the Anti-Defamation League said it’s not wise to add occupations to hate-crime protected classes. \"It’s really focused on immutable characteristics,\" Allison Goodman told the Advocate. \"Proving the bias intent for a hate crime for law enforcement or first responders is very different than proving it for someone who is Jewish or gay or black.\" The change to Louisiana law would mean those convicted of committing felony hate crimes against police officers could face a maximum fine of $5,000 or a five-year prison sentence. A hate-crime charge added to a misdemeanor carries a $500 fine or six months imprisonment. This post, originally published on May 21, has been updated.

(AP) — Faced with a copper shortage at the beginning of World War II, the U.S. Mint authorized experiments to make pennies from other metals, plastic and rubber. A Tennessee company made some from glass and failed so spectacularly that only one known unbroken penny remains — and it is scheduled to be auctioned Thursday. Another broken piece is also known to exist. The Fort Lauderdale-based Heritage Auctions will conduct in-person and online bidding for the coin that it hopes will exceed $30,000. The coin is owned by Roger Burdette, who wrote a book about World War II experimental coins and purchased the piece during a small online auction last summer \"for several thousand dollars.\" He declined to be more specific. \"I knew pretty well what it was from the illustrations, but I couldn\\'t be sure without examining it and that wasn\\'t a possibility without buying it,\" Burdette said Tuesday. \"These things have been so poorly documented.\" After the U.S. entered the war in late 1941, the military needed most of the nation\\'s copper to make ammunition and equipment. The U.S. Mint handed out dies to companies willing to make experimental, uncirculated pennies as it tried to find a suitable replacement. The Blue Ridge Glass Co., a Kingsport, Tennessee, manufacturer that no longer exists, made an unknown number of pennies from a hardened, yellow-amber glass — Burdette\\'s survivor looks something like a round cough drop. Burdette, a retired Potomac Falls, Virginia, technical researcher, says that according to a report the company filed with the Mint, the glass coins didn\\'t have the precise images needed and couldn\\'t be made a uniform size and weight. The coins also developed sharp edges that could cut fingers. He believes the company destroyed or threw away most of its stock. He said he tried to contact the previous owner to find out where he got the survivor, but without luck. In 1943, the Mint made pennies from low-grade steel covered with zinc. Those shiny coins came with their own problems, including looking too much like a dime. By 1944, the Mint began making copper-based pennies again, using shell casings collected from military training sites. This pretty penny could cost you a pretty penny',\n",

              "  'context': 'Fundamentalist Christian bastion Bob Jones University has sparked controversy after summarily dismissing a consultant group investigating the way the school handled sexual assault accusations. In 2012, the Greenville, S.C., school hired Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment (GRACE) to investigate how the university responded to reports of sexual assault, the New York Times reports. The group\\'s findings were set to be released in March. For years there have been allegations that Bob Jones University had been stifling the reporting of sexual assaults, and the school\\'s decision to dismiss GRACE late last month -- mere weeks before its report would be made public -- has therefore been criticized by former students and others affiliated with the school. \"As always, they’re worried about protecting the church and the university, not the victims,\" Camille Lewis, a former Bob Jones student and faculty member, told the New York Times. Others associated with the school said they had always suspected the investigation \"was too good to be true.\" Speaking with local station WYYF News 4, former Bob Jones student Erin Burchwell said she had hoped the GRACE report would validate her allegations. Burchwell said a male student molested her several times in the 1990s, but when she reported the abuse, school officials requested she not go to the police. She told the outlet that administrators also seemed to imply the assaults were partly her fault. \"What was I wearing when all these incidents occurred? What did I have on? Was it tight? Was it low? Obviously, the point being it was somehow my fault,\" she told WYYF News 4. On Feb. 6, GRACE posted a notice about the university\\'s decision to terminate the agreement \"days before [it] was to conduct the last interviews.\" A representative declined to comment further when contacted by The Huffington Post on Wednesday. In a video posted on the school\\'s website, President Stephen Jones stressed it was the university\\'s decision to look back at cases of alleged abuse. He vowed to finish the investigation with or without GRACE. \"GRACE had begun going beyond the originally outlined intentions,\" he said. \"Since the termination, we have intended to immediately negotiate a new contract with GRACE that would enable them to complete the review to achieve our objectives ... It\\'s disappointing that we were not able to have that conversation and reach agreement and continue the process before GRACE went public with it.\" This is not the first time questions surrounding Bob Jones\\' sexual assault policies have surfaced. In November, Al Jazeera America spoke to several Bob Jones students who said the school\\'s strict moral guidelines made talking about abuse difficult. \"The typical response to sexual abuse is first they need to forgive their abuser, and second is that they shouldn’t talk about it or it will hurt the cause of Christ,\" Jeffrey Hoffman, an alumni of the Bob Jones elementary, junior high and high school academies, told the news outlet. Hoffman told Al Jazeera he was molested on church premises by a Sunday school teacher when he was a boy. The school\\'s handbook forbids \"physical contact between unmarried men and women\" and counts \"hard-core pornography, sensual behavior or use of alcohol or drugs\" as a major moral failure. Bob Jones University spokesman Randy Page previously told Al Jazeera that hiring GRACE was a \"proactive\" measure and not prompted by any incident. \"When cases of abuse are reported, BJU will place the interests of the victim first,\" Page told the outlet. \"BJU believes that a victim of abuse or neglect is not to blame for the abuse foisted on him or her. BJU will take reasonable steps to protect the safety of a victim when a report is made.\" Bob Jones University Halts Sexual Assault Investigation Weeks Before Results Released',\n",

USGS scientists met with state and local officials on Wednesday to discuss what might happen if a 9.1 earthquake -- similar to the one that struck Japan in 2011 -- occurred offshore of the Alaskan Peninsula. Researchers called the scenario \"hypothetical, yet plausible,\" warning officials to prepare for the worst. In the hypothetical scenario, researchers said waves of up to 24 feet high could batter the California coast. \"And this is not one wave. It won’t even look like a wave, it’s going to be surges,\" explained Dr. Lucy Jones, Chief Scientist of the USGS Multi-Hazards Demonstration Project, to NBC San Diego. \"We’re only going to have like three-and-a-half hours between the time we determine it really is a big tsunami coming and the time that the waves get here.\" Areas worst affected would likely include the San Francisco Bay Area, Santa Cruz and Monterey, Paso Robles, Santa Maria and parts of Los Angeles and Orange County. The Oakland Airport and low-lying islands like Alameda in the Bay Area and Balboa in Newport Beach could be entirely underwater. Researchers said the waves could decimate the ports of Oakland, Los Angeles and Long Beach, and force the evacuation of more than 750,000 people. In the destruction, crude oil, fuel, sewage and other contaminants could be emptied into the open sea. Fortunately, according to the survey, California’s two nuclear plants would likely not be at risk. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the survey utilized input from more than 150 specialists from universities, state and local governments and coastal industries. The survey was part of a 12-chapter study, examining the potential effects of a large Alaskan earthquake in an effort to help officials better prepare for a large-scale disaster. \"The 2011 Tohoku earthquake was not anticipated, despite Japan having the best seismic and geodetic networks in the world and the best historical record in the world over the past 1,500 years,\" researchers said. \"What was lacking was adequate paleogeologic data on prehistoric earthquakes and tsunamis, a data gap that also presently applies to the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands.\" Researchers said that proper evaluation and preparedness could greatly lessen the extent of such a disaster. \"A number of steps can be taken by governments, businesses, and residents to help reduce the environmental impacts of tsunamis and to recover more quickly from these environmental impacts.\" Alaskan Earthquake Could Destroy California Coast: U.S. Geological Survey',\n",

But, as the younger Mr. Trump wrote in \"The Art of the Deal,\" nobody was doing that by the 1980s because \"it’s not profitable and government subsidies have been eliminated.\" So the younger Mr. Trump shifted toward higher-profile projects in Manhattan, which also depended on government assistance in the form of tax abatements. His earliest major construction deal in Manhattan was the redevelopment of the Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Terminal, now the glass-covered Grand Hyatt. Mr. Trump sought and won a 40-year property tax abatement (one so long it is still in place today) over the objections of other hotel operators. Before that, he helped persuade the city to build the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on a former Penn Central rail yard on the Far West Side; Trump earned an $833,000 fee when the city bought the land, on which he held a purchase option. A lot of conservatives have criticized public spending on convention centers as a subsidy to the hotel industry, but Mr. Trump called the publicly funded convention center project \"critical to reviving the city’s image and, ultimately, to putting its economy back on track.\" When seeking tax abatements and zoning variances for his private projects, Mr. Trump emphasized how great his developments would be for the city. The tax breaks for the Grand Hyatt, he said, were the only way to stop the existing building from becoming a closed, blighted eyesore. His planned Television City development (a now scrapped proposal to bring NBC to a site on the Hudson River in the West 60s) would bring \"business worth at least $500 million a year from new residents.\" Sometimes public officials bought these arguments and sometimes they didn’t. But nowhere in the book is there a contention that he shouldn’t have to make them. Never does he say that it’s none of the government’s business how he does business. This is more evidence for what some conservatives have been shouting with increasing alarm: Donald Trump is not one of us, does not share a gut-level suspicion of government, is not a true believer in free enterprise. Mr. Trump is an enthusiast of business, but as conservative critics of \"crony capitalism\" emphasize, being pro-business is not the same as being pro-market. That said, while \"The Art of the Deal\" is not antigovernment in general, it does contain a lot of complaints about specific actions of government. For example, he disliked Ronald Reagan’s 1986 tax reform, which abolished various tax deductions related to real estate. This move, he wrote, \"will be a disaster for the country, since it eliminates the incentives to invest and build — particularly in secondary locations, where no building will occur unless there are incentives.\" That is, while Mr. Trump is running on a platform of tax simplification today, he was against it 30 years ago. Parts of the book presage Mr. Trump’s recent rants about \"stupid\" politicians. Mayor Ed Koch, he wrote, \"has achieved something quite miraculous. He’s presided over an administration that is both pervasively corrupt and totally incompetent.\" One chapter is devoted to an almost gleeful description of how the construction of an ice rink in Central Park was botched — they tried to build it on a slope, can you believe that? — and then Mr. Trump took over and got done in six months what the city had failed to do inside six years. But these are not so much arguments against government as against stupidity. Cost overruns on the Javits Center could have been avoided, Mr. Trump wrote, if the city had awarded the construction contract to him as he had suggested. Not surprisingly, this year, he has talked about the need for infrastructure spending with the zeal of many Democrats — while insisting he can deliver needed upgrades much more cheaply than the government would. Twenty-nine years is a long time, and \"The Art of the Deal,\" which he wrote with Tony Schwartz, who is now a contributor to The New York Times, will not necessarily be Mr. Trump’s blueprint for governing. But in his campaign speeches, Mr. Trump has often echoed the meddlesome approach to business he learned from New York City officials. As president, Mr. Trump likes to say, he’d call up the chief of Ford with a threat: Move your factories back from Mexico or I’ll slap a huge tax on your imports. This is antithetical to the conservative approach that says markets, not the government, should determine the allocation of business capital. But it is fully in line with the ideas in \"The Art of the Deal.\" Donald Trump and the Art of the Public Sector Deal',\n",

Melbourne - Life has been less than kind to Isaac Walker, pictured above on the streets of Melbourne. A former radio announcer, he had tragically lost his wife at the young age of 35, he spiraled into depression and lost his job. The bills kept piling, and he just couldn\\'t get ahead. Before long he was evicted from his home. But now thanks to this simple options trading platform, Isaac\\'s life is turning around... It all turned around when Isaac clicked on an advertisement he saw while browsing the internet at the unemployment office. \"I came across this new online stock trading platform that promised $6,000 worth of profits in three weeks. Yeah, right. I was extremely skeptical, but, I was in a really dark place and had nothing to lose at that point. I had around $320 left in my bank account and decided to deposit the $250 to join. I had to try it, I still had hope of a brighter future.\" Isaac had found Magnum Options and it would change his life for the better. \"I was just hanging out in the shelter looking for something to do when I came across this blueprint. At first I watched the video and I still felt skeptical after seeing so many people earn thousands and even hundreds of thousands trading online, but once I made my deposits, I went through the written material and the experience was incredible! I didn\\'t expect much but from the very start it turned out to be great fun! The courses were easy to get through and I made about $600 in my first week. As promised, there weren\\'t any commission fees and I\\'ve been getting paid at the end of each week!\" It was only two weeks ago when Isaac had just $320 in his bank account, literally. After his first week on the platform, he decided to put his earnings back into the platform and keep earning. He didn\\'t want to stop! \"The courses made it really easy to make trades. The system literally tells you what to do! In the first two weeks I ended up depositing around $800 and made over $3,000. This was a no-brainer. My chance at a new life was appearing right before my eyes.\" Isaac then proceeded to tell us about his fourth week trading Magnum Options. He told us about the process. We could tell he was a changed man. After disclosing that he had earned over $30,000 in the last four weeks, he showed us a picture of his bank statement. We couldn\\'t believe it either, but after noticing Isaac\\'s appearance, Isaac really looked like a new man. He had a clean haircut, new clothes, a simple car, and even a new phone. \"It\\'s important for me to have a good smartphone. I check my trades daily and make sure that I\\'m earning money every day. Most of the time I\\'m barely working! I\\'m grateful for Magnum Options, it\\'s really changed my life!\". Isaac\\'s story is an incredible one. We checked back in with him in his sixth week trading Magnum Options and we couldn\\'t really believe his claims. Isaac said that he had hit the jackpot, literally, after Magnum Options told him to make a series of trades. In his sixth week trading, Isaac earned a cool $892,329. \"I jumped up and started cheering! It must\\'ve been quite a sight. Here I was, screaming and cheering and dancing around the shelter, haha.. they thought I\\'d lost everything! But it was the exact opposite!\" But his joy quickly turned into skepticism. \"How is this possible, this can\\'t be right?! That\\'s what I thought. So I calmed down, and requested a payout. And then I waited.\" Then, two days later, having almost forgotten about it, he checked his bank account, \"and then I read it was real. Nearly a million Australian dollars in my bank account, I nearly had a heart attack! Haha! Since I was a little kid I always had dreams of owning my own Ferrari, it was all I ever wanted, my room was plastered with photos of red Ferraris. So after I saw almost 900K in my bank account and my Magnum Options account growing ever still I said \"Screw it! I\\'m buying one! When I pulled up to my local hotel in my brand new Ferrari 488 convertible my buddies jaws hit the floor!\" And while he may be one of the bigger winners of this new trading platforms grand opening promotion, Isaac certainly isn\\'t the only one to cash out on Magnum Options\\'s new trading platform. Since the promotion began this February, over 738 new traders all over the world have won money from just an easy $250 deposit. However, it appears that the \"New Trader Promotion\" will be soon ending as the company has already paid out over $2,680,000 in total earnings this last month. At least, that’s the opinion of noted industry expert Alan Silver, \"This is something you often see with online trading platforms, Silver says. \"They start off with ridiculous promotions and once they have enough traders, they tone it down and it becomes harder to make a profit. The same is happening at Magnum Options. They might continue this for a few more weeks, maybe a few months tops, but then it’s over.\" CNN\\'s reporter Jane Fayerman also tried her hand at the platform but sadly only walked away with $485 profit on her series of trades - \"you can\\'t always win as big as Isaac sadly!\" *As promised, here is the link to access the special offer (also works on mobile devices).

              "  'context': 'Business schools like to say they’re at the leading edge of corporate innovation, boasting on-campus incubators and electives on design thinking. But almost all rely on a teaching tool that’s barely changed in more than a century. To learn how to lead companies, MBA students read hundreds of case studies—stripped-down narratives about a strategy problem at a real company—and discuss how they would tackle the challenge. For Harvard Business School, which created and popularized the method— the school taught its first case in 1912—case studies are a cottage industry as well as a bedrock of the curriculum. Harvard Business Publishing says it sells to about 4,000 schools globally; its cases account for 80 percent of the case studies used. HBP, which also publishes other business materials and the Harvard Business Review, had revenue of $194 million in 2014, according to the business school’s annual report, a 44 percent increase from 2010. The publisher says it sold 12 million cases last year, to schools, companies, and others, and that and sales totaled about $30 million. Retail prices run from $9 to $15 for a basic case study; schools get discounts. \"The case method takes the learner through a reflective and analytic process that is very powerful,\" says Robert Bruner, dean of the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. Some of Harvard’s case studies seem hardly more sophisticated than Wikipedia entries, and that’s deliberate, says Willis Emmons, director of Harvard’s C. Roland Christensen Center for Teaching and Learning. \"Our cases are intentionally very limited in the amount of analysis they include,\" he says. \"The challenge for the student is to take both qualitative and quantitative information and make sense of that.\" HBP also sells teaching notes for business professors to facilitate class discussion of the cases. These include suggestions for specific words instructors should write on blackboards. At Harvard Business School, professors are given detailed profiles of their students, called class cards, that dictate the order and timing of whom they call on in a typical 80-minute class. \"The stronger and more experienced a faculty member is, the less visible it is how much work has gone into a session,\" says Emmons. The sheer scale of Harvard’s publishing machine helps it maintain dominance in the case market. Darden Business Publishing calls itself the second-biggest publisher of cases in the U.S., but it sold fewer than 700,000 cases in 2014, according to Steve Momper, DBP’s executive director. HBP produces and distributes co-branded case studies for about 40 business schools. These include the University of California at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, which launched a case series last year. Haas has no designs on challenging Harvard’s market share; the school publishes cases to strengthen its brand and showcase the technology industry expertise of its Bay Area-based staff, says Richard Lyons, the dean. Case publishers often try to add variety to material that, well into the 1970s, featured subjects that were \"virtually always male and in settings that were quite prominently in the U.S.,\" says Darden’s Bruner, who received an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1974. HBS is trying to reflect a more modern business landscape. In 2014, Nitin Nohria, dean of the business school, pledged to raise the share of women protagonists in Harvard cases to 20 percent. Cases increasingly incorporate video and Web-based elements, and a few find business lessons in unconventional sources, such as the case HBP published last year by Harvard professor Anita Elberse devoted to Beyoncé’s surprise 2013 album release. Of the 25 top business schools ranked by Bloomberg Businessweek last year, 19 reported that they use case studies as one of their main teaching tools. At HBS, 80 percent of class time is spent on case studies; at Darden, the figure is 75 percent. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg\\'s daily newsletter. Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business uses case studies for about 30 percent of its instruction, according to Dean Robert Dammon. It considers them a supplement to management science, a teaching method developed at Tepper. \"The school was really founded to find an alternative approach to business education than the one that was being offered by schools like Harvard,\" says Dammon. \"In a case study, the relevant set of facts is laid out for you. Most business problems aren’t presented to you in that way.\" The bottom line: The publishing arm of Harvard Business School sells case studies to about 4,000 business schools worldwide.

At 28 years old, he is a two-time NBA champion and a two-time Olympic gold medalist. He has amassed nine All-Star appearances and four league MVPs. And yet one of the keys to his success may have nothing to do with his athletic ability. In an interview with Chris Broussard of ESPN The Magazine, James explains how he came to the decision to turn off his cell phone and watch TV more selectively during the postseason in order to focus as much as possible on the task at hand. \"I turn my phones off,\" James said. \"No communication.\" Part of shutting off those lines of communications includes not checking Twitter. Back in April, he signed off for the 2013 playoffs with the message: Zero Dark Thirty-6 Activated! I\\'m gone — LeBron James (@KingJames) April 21, 2013 He didn\\'t tweet again until a month later -- with the championship ring on his finger. James said that unplugging helps him resist getting caught up in the pre-game hype. \"Everything\\'s magnified during the playoffs,\" James said, \"and I like to get away from it ... Just to focus. I wanted to try it. It was something unconventional.\" James\\' \"unconventional\" idea came on the heels of Miami\\'s 2011 Finals loss to Dallas, during which he averaged fewer than 18 points per game, a career playoff worst. \"I froze, I didn\\'t show up, I was late for my own funeral,\" he told Broussard. Facing the same media frenzy the following year, he was looking for a way to improve his performance. \"I said, \\'You know what? The playoffs start on Saturday. I\\'m going to turn my phones off on Friday. I\\'m going to see if I can do it.\\'\" James explained to Sideline\\'s Craig Sager last April what he does with his time instead. \"Just read a little more than I did during the regular season,\" James told him. \"Not much sports talk radio. I watch the playoffs. I watch cartoons with my kids. I watch movies with the family but not much of what sports (broadcasters) are talking about.\" Among the titles James read during the 2012 season were \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy and Jay-Z\\'s Decoded. \"The reading has helped me get away from the game a little bit, and I\\'m able zero in once I\\'m done and get ready for the games,\" James said, according to USA Today. His strategy is also reportedly rubbing off on his head coach, Eric Spoelstra, the outlet reported. James recently took the \"no phone\" policy a step further, reportedly discouraging guests from bringing phones to his San Diego wedding -- although the request was probably unrelated to his need for concentration.

              "  'context': 'I recently talked with some Linux developers about what the best laptop is for serious programmers. As a result I checked out several laptops from a programmer\\'s viewpoint. The winner in my book? The 2016 Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition. I\\'m in good company. Linus Torvalds, Linux\\'s creator, agrees. The Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, for him, is the best laptop around. Torvald\\'s requirements may not be yours though. On Google+, Torvalds explained, \"First off: I don\\'t use my laptop as a desktop replacement, and I only travel for a small handful of events each year. So for me, the laptop is a fairly specialized thing that doesn\\'t get daily (or even weekly) use, so the main criteria are not some kind of \"average daily use\", but very much \"travel use\". Therefore, for Torvalds, \"I end up caring a lot about it being fairly small and light, because I may end up carrying it around all day at a conference. I also want it to have a good screen, because by now I\\'m just used to it at my main desktop, and I want my text to be legible but small.\" The Dell\\'s display is powered by Intel\\'s Iris 540 GPU. In my experience it works really well. The Iris powers a 13.3 inch display with a 3,200×1,800 touchscreen. That\\'s 280 pixels per inch, 40 more than my beloved 2015 Chromebook Pixel and 60 more than a MacBook Pro with Retina. However, getting that hardware to work and play well with the Gnome desktop isn\\'t easy. As Torvalds explained in another post, it \"has the same resolution as my desktop, but apparently because the laptop screen is smaller, Gnome seems to decide on its own that I need an automatic scaling factor of 2, which blows up all the stupid things (window decorations, icons etc) to a ridiculous degree\". The solution? You can forget about looking to the user interface. You need to go to the shell and run: gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor 1. Torvalds may use Gnome, but he\\'s never liked the Gnome 3.x family much. I can\\'t argue with him. That\\'s why I use Cinnamon instead. He also wants \"a reasonably powerful CPU, because when I\\'m traveling I still build the kernel a lot. I don\\'t do my normal full \\'make allmodconfig\\' build between each pull request like I do at home, but I\\'d like to do it more often than I did with my previous laptop, which is actually (along with the screen) the main reason I wanted to upgrade.\" Linus doesn\\'t describe the features of his XPS 13, but my review unit was a high-end model. It came with dual-core, 2.2GHz 6th Generation Intel Core i7-6560U Skylake processor and 16GBs of DDR3 RAM with a half a terabyte, PCIe solid state drive (SSD). I\\'m sure Torvalds\\' system is at least that well-equipped. Some features you may care about aren\\'t on Torvalds\\' list. \"What I don\\'t tend to care about is touch-screens, because my fingers are big and clumsy compared to the text I\\'m looking at (I also can\\'t handle the smudges: maybe I just have particularly oily fingers, but I really don\\'t want to touch that screen). I also don\\'t care deeply about some \\'all day battery life\\', because quite frankly, I can\\'t recall the last time I didn\\'t have access to power. I might not want to bother to plug it in for some quick check, but it\\'s just not a big overwhelming issue. By the time battery life is in \\'more than a couple of hours\\', I just don\\'t care very much any more.\" Dell claims the XPS 13, with its 56wHR, 4-Cell Battery, has about a 12-hour battery life. It has well over 10 in my experience. I haven\\'t tried to run it down to the dregs. Torvalds also didn\\'t have any trouble with the Intel Wi-Fi set. The non Developer Edition uses a Broadcom chip set and that has proven troublesome for both Windows and Linux users. Dell technical support was extremely helpful to me in getting this problem under control. Some people have trouble with the XPS 13 touchpad. Neither I nor Torvalds have any worries. Torvalds wrote, the \"XPS13 touchpad works very well for me. That may be a personal preference thing, but it seems to be both smooth and responsive.\" Still, while Torvalds likes the XPS 13, he\\'s also fond of the latest Lenovo X1 Carbon, HP Spectre 13 x360, and last year\\'s Lenovo Yoga 900. Me? I like the XPS 13 Developer Editor. The price tag, which for the model I reviewed was $1949.99, may keep you from reaching for your credit card. Still, if you want to develop like one of the world\\'s top programmers, the Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition is worth the money. \\u200bLinus Torvalds reveals his favorite programming laptop',\n",

The research, published Monday in the journal Oxford Economic Papers, looked at data from the 1870s to 1980. During that time frame, the average height of European men surged from 167 cm (5 ft, 5in) to 178 cm (5 ft, 10 in) -- that\\'s a rate of around a millimeter each year and a centimeter each decade. \"Increases in human stature are a key indicator of improvements in the average health of populations,\" Dr. Timothy J. Hatton, economics professor at the University of Essex in the U.K. and Australian National University in Canberra, said in a written statement. So what explains the growth? \"The evidence suggests that the improving disease environment, as reflected in the fall in infant mortality, is the single most important factor driving the increase in height,\" Hatton said in the statement. Another possible reason might be the downward trend in fertility and family sizes, which have previously been linked to height increases, Reuters reported. Higher per capita income, better social services and nutrition may have played a role as well. Then does this mean how tall you are reflects how healthy you are? Not so fast. \"We can\\'t conclude that shorter men are somehow unhealthier.

              "  'context': 'After calling out makers of cars and air conditioners, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has set his sights on a new industry to pressure for manufacturing jobs: drug companies. In his first press conference since his election, Trump lumped pharmaceutical firms in with the car companies that so far have borne the brunt of his Twitter feed for moving operations abroad. \"We’ve got to get our drug industry back,\" he said. \"They supply our drugs but they don’t make them here, to a large extent.\" Afterward, pharmaceutical stocks around the world plunged, partly on Trump’s promise to cut drug prices but also on concerns that companies could face the same choice he’s proposed for carmakers: make it in the U.S. or face punitive tariffs. For the most part, no. About 75 percent of U.S. spending on drugs is for products that are manufactured domestically. The expiration dates on medicines mean it pays to be nearer to the end consumer. Being close to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in a tightly regulated industry doesn’t hurt either. Nevertheless, because of the sheer size of the American market -- the biggest in the world by far -- the $86 billion of medicine brought in from the rest of the world in 2015 still makes the U.S. the biggest drug importer on the planet. The value of those imports has almost doubled since 2005. In 2015, the U.S.’s top five sources of pharmaceutical imports by value were Ireland, Germany, the U.K., Switzerland and India. With the exception of India, those countries aren’t exactly places to find cheap labor. Yet Germany, the U.K. and Switzerland are home to some of the world’s biggest research-based pharmaceutical companies, firms that develop new drugs and then manufacture what they design. Germany and Switzerland are also headquarters to the two largest contract manufacturers for biological medicines. Whereas most drugs are chemically synthesized, biologics come from human, animal or micro-organism sources and require a great deal of know-how and high-tech equipment to make. Ireland is the biggest source of U.S. imports, accounting for $25 billion of drugs in 2015. It has emerged as a center of pharmaceutical manufacturing largely in the past decade as its low corporate tax rate and other incentives attracted $8 billion in investment. Nine of the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world now have operations in Ireland. The country’s tax policies have proved so attractive to drug and medical-device companies that some, including Allergan, Medtronic and Shire, have made Dublin their legal address. The U.S. may have put a stop to these so-called tax inversions with rule changes last year. After the Treasury issued the revisions, U.S.-based Pfizer and AbbVie abandoned their planned mergers with Irish-based companies. India represents a different case from the European countries on the list. Rather than producing small volumes of high-priced, innovative medicines, Indian companies specialize in large volumes of cheap generics. These are copies of drugs whose U.S. patent protection has expired. Generics are essentially a commodity where the producer with the lowest production cost wins the market. They now make up eight of 10 prescriptions filled in the U.S., though because they are so much less expensive than branded drugs they account for only about 22 percent of total spending on pharmaceuticals. With manufacturing costs in India as much as 50 percent lower than in Western industrialized countries, India has become the biggest exporter of generics in the world. Sales of generic medicines in the U.S. reached $70 billion in 2015, and that’s expected to grow as more medicines go off patent. The Indians and Chinese say Americans would pay higher prices if they made more of their own generics and drug components. That would put Trump in a bind given that he’s also said he wants to bring down prices. In the U.S., the cost of a generic drug, the kind that India specializes in producing, is estimated to be 80 percent to 85 percent lower than that of the brand-name equivalent. In 2010 alone, the FDA estimates, the use of generic drugs in the U.S. saved $158 billion, or $3 billion every week. Where the U.S. Actually Gets Its Drug Supply: QuickTake Q&A',\n",

Now coffee spread is here to confuse and delight your palate in the morning. Upmarket department store Selfridges claims it has invented the world’s first coffee spread, which contains a shot of espresso per 9g.  The world-famous store, on London’s Oxford Street, rolled out Coffee Spread on 4 April, to coincide with UK Coffee Week which runs from 10 to 16 of April.  The spread, developed by the brand Flat Brew, contains a mix of Arabica coffee beans, cocoa butter, sugar and cream which gives it a thick, black apperance. It\\'s not surprising, then, that a 20g serving contains 91 calories, according to The Evening Standard.  \"The texture of the spread smooth and similar to peanut butter, and although the alarmingly dark colour takes some getting used to, the taste is deliciously sweet - more like a coffee-infused Nutella than a bitter espresso shot,\" according to an Evening Standard writer who tried the paste.  According to Flat Brew, their coffee spread took one year to develop. Those who want to give it a try must fork out £5.99 for a 285g jar. Like Nutella, Selfridge\\'s say that the spread can be slathered on toast as well as croissants or spooned directly out of the jar.

Killed by Police is mainly open-sourced and also relies on corporate news reports for its data on people killed by police. For its database, The Guardian relies on traditional reporting on police reports and witness statements, while also culling data from verified crowdsourced information using regional news outlets, research groups, and reporting projects that include Killed by Police. There has always been a high volume of police killings, although damning videos, photos, and news reports highlight officer violence — especially against people of color — now more than ever. But what’s become an even more alarming trend is the number of officers involved in these killings who receive minor to no punishment. According to the According to the Wall Street Journal , 2015 saw the highest number of police officers being charged for deadly, on-duty shootings in a decade: 12 as of September 2015. Still, in a year when approximately 1,200 people were killed by police, zero officers were convicted of murder or manslaughter, painting the picture that officers involved in killing another person will not be held accountable for their actions. In 2016, several officers have gone to trial but none of them received jail time. Here are some of the most egregious examples of cops who haven’t been penalized for killing: William Porter, Edward Nero, and Caesar Goodwin — Baltimore, Maryland Freddie Gray was apprehended by police during a bike patrol on April 12, 2015, when a violent arrest left him unable to walk on his own. On the way to booking, no officer put a seat belt on Gray, causing him to be thrown around the van with no help received from any of the officers. In total, there were six officers involved in his death, and three have been tried so far. But during those three trials, which spanned from December 2015 to June, none of the officers were convicted. The trial of The trial of Officer William Porter ended in a hung jury in December, amounting to no action being taken against Porter unless a second trial scheduled for later this year finds him guilty. In May, Officer Edward Nero was declared not guilty of all criminal charges against him — second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, and misconduct in office. Nero was one of the first officers to encounter Gray during his arrest and helped load Gray into the police van, where he was not secured with a seat belt. On June 23, the latest trial in Gray’s case found On June 23, the latest trial in Gray’s case found Officer Caesar Goodwin not guilty of second-degree depraved heart murder, reckless endangerment, second-degree assault, and manslaughter. Goodwin drove the police van where Gray suffered the spine injury that ultimately led to his death, didn’t secure the 25-year-old’s seat belt, and waited to call a medic when Gray was in distress. Goodson faced the most serious charges of the six officers. Peter Liang — New York City In April, two months after a jury convicted him of manslaughter and official misconduct, former In April, two months after a jury convicted him of manslaughter and official misconduct, former NYPD Oficer Officer Peter Liang was sentenced to five years probation and 800 hours of community service. Liang is responsible for fatally shooting 28-year-old Brooklyn resident Akai Gurley last November, in the dark stairwell of a public housing building. While Liang was in the building, the rookie cop claimed he accidentally fired his gun and the bullet ricocheted off the wall before striking Gurley in the heart. Gurley was innocent of any wrongdoing and unarmed when he was killed. During the trial, Liang claimed the shooting was accidental, but was convicted of manslaughter in February. The former officer was also convicted of official misconduct for failing to provide any sort of medical assistance to Gurley as he lay bleeding on the staircase. Following his conviction, Liang was fired from the NYPD. Just before his sentence was handed down, the manslaughter charge was reduced to criminally negligent homicide. And despite being convicted of manslaughter, Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson announced in March that jail time for Liang should be taken off the table. He recommended six months of house arrest, five years of probation, and 500 hours of community service, instead. Liang was the first NYPD officer convicted of an on-duty shooting in the past decade. Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze — Minneapolis, Minnesota In March, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced that the two officers involved in the fatal shooting of 24-year-old In March, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced that the two officers involved in the fatal shooting of 24-year-old Jamar Clark will not be facing any criminal charges for their actions. Clark, who was unarmed, died from a gunshot to the head when Schwarz fired his gun 61 seconds after arriving on the scene. According to the county attorney, Clark was resisting arrest and attempted to grab Ringgenberg’s gun. Despite this claim, several witness say that Clark was already handcuffed. Although placed on administrative leave following the shooting, both officers returned to desk duty in January. Two weeks prior to the decision, Freeman Two weeks prior to the decision, Freeman announced that Hennepin County, including Minneapolis, will no longer use grand juries to determine whether cops involved in fatal shootings should be indicted. \"I concluded that the accountability and transparency limitations of a grand jury are too high a hurdle to overcome,\" he said. Beginning with Clark’s case, Freeman’s office would decide to indict in the future. The policy shift was made in response to pressure from Black Lives Matter activists who protested against grand jury proceedings in the Clark case. Celisa Calacal is an intern with ThinkProgress.

Nothing is more important to Floyd Mayweather Jr. than his image, so we really shouldn’t be surprised to hear how much he spends on haircuts. Still, we can’t help but shake our head at it. TMZ recently spoke with Jackie Starr, who is Mayweather’s stylist and has been cutting his hair since 2009. It sounds like a pretty good gig for her, as Floyd pays $1,000 per haircut and hits her up multiple times a week. \"I cut his hair two times a week, three times is pushing it, but then it also depends on the occasion,\" Starr said. \"If he’s in training I will cut him Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\" That means there are weeks when Starr makes $3,000 just for cutting Mayweather’s hair. She could do nothing else and pull in six figures annually by giving Floyd haircuts. Not bad, right? As we know, Mayweather has lots and lots of money.

And as much as its users believe in it, investors do too, which is why they haven't been shy about helping with funding. Unlike messages on the platform, the money won't be disappearing any time soon. Snapchat is now looking to raise about $200 million in new funding, which means that the company can be worth a pretty penny if investors help it out. This new round of funding is an extension of the Series F round from March, where Snapchat raised $175 million from Fidelity. This fundraising gave the company a valuation of $16 billion. According to VC Experts, if Snapchat is able to raise its desired $200 million the company will then be valued at $22.7 billion. Of course this is just an estimate since this valuation is based on the fact that Snapchat would remain $30.72 per share. It would also mean that Snapchat has raised a total of more than $1.5 billon in funding. While this large valuation reveals Snapchat's success, it could also make it harder for another company to acquire it in the future the more expensive it becomes. Facebook attempted to do exactly this when it tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion back in 2013. Snapchat continues to be privately owned Popular among teens, Snapchat has exploded as of late. The company continues to roll out new features like giant stickers, one-handed zooming for iOS, new filters almost on the daily, voice calls and audio and video messaging. Snapchat is also reportedly revamping its Discover section next month, which will include a new layout that won't feature those circular icons that it currently has. The app's CEO Evan Spiegel revealed earlier this year that it has more than 100 million daily users. With its large user base and investors constantly taking a bite out of the fundraising pie, it's safe to say Snapchat as we know it will be sticking around for some time.

The only condition is that you have to keep on spinning a chain of unique Pokéstops. This will also help you to get an egg if you have any slots available for one. What you need to do is visit Pokéstops, but while doing so ensuring that you don’t visit the same one twice within your chain of 10 stops. The idea is to visit 10 unique Pokéstops in a row to get the added bonus and more items. We have been out to test this trick to ensure that it works and below is what we have found. On our route we visited 25 different Pokéstops around Southampton, Hampshire. Testing 10 in a row with each being unique Pokéstop 1 – 2 Items Pokéstop 2 – 3 Items Pokéstop 3 – 2 Items Pokéstop 4 – 4 Items Pokéstop 5 – 5 Items Pokéstop 6 – 3 Items Pokéstop 7 – 2 Items Pokéstop 8 – 2 Items Pokéstop 9 – 2 Items Pokéstop 10 – 8 Items + 100 Experience points Pokéstop 11 – 4 Items Pokéstop 12 – 5 Items For the above test we went to 12 Pokéstops, ensuring that we didn’t visit the same one twice in the chain. You can see that for the first 9 stops we got less than 6 items and then on the 10th Pokéstop we got 8 items (which was a nice haul!). After the 10th we went back down to less than 6 items again. We then did the same test again, however we went back on ourselves and visited the same Pokéstop twice in order to see if we got more loot on the 10th Pokéstop. In total we visited 13 Pokéstops. Pokéstop 1 – 3 Items Pokéstop 2 – 5 Items Pokéstop 3 – 4 Items Pokéstop 4 – 2 Items Pokéstop 5 – 3 Items Pokéstop 6 – 3 Items Pokéstop 7 – 4 Items Pokéstop 8 – 2 Items Pokéstop 9 – 4 Items Pokéstop 10 – 4 Items Pokéstop 11 – 5 Items Pokéstop 12 – 2 Items Pokéstop 13 – 3 Items As you can see, by visiting the same stops twice on our route we were not awarded with more than 6 items when visiting the 10th Pokéstop and also didnt get an experience bonus.

              "  'context': 'But envisioning this process with rock music is harder. Almost anything can be labeled \"rock\": Metallica, ABBA, Mannheim Steamroller, a haircut, a muffler. If you’re a successful tax lawyer who owns a hot tub, clients will refer to you as a \"rock-star C.P.A.\" when describing your business to less-hip neighbors. The defining music of the first half of the 20th century was jazz; the defining music of the second half of the 20th century was rock, but with an ideology and saturation far more pervasive. Only television surpasses its influence. This article is adapted from the book \"But What If We\\'re Wrong?\" to be published in June by Blue Rider Press. And pretty much from the moment it came into being, people who liked rock insisted it was dying. The critic Richard Meltzer supposedly claimed that rock was already dead in 1968. And he was wrong to the same degree that he was right. Meltzer’s wrongness is obvious and does not require explanation, unless you honestly think \"Purple Rain\" is awful. But his rightness is more complicated: Rock is dead, in the sense that its \"aliveness\" is a subjective assertion based on whatever criteria the listener happens to care about. This is why the essential significance of rock remains a plausible thing to debate, as does the relative value of major figures within that system (the Doors, R.E.M., Radiohead). It still projects the illusion of a universe containing multitudes. But it won’t seem that way in 300 years. The symbolic value of rock is conflict-based: It emerged as a byproduct of the post-World War II invention of the teenager, soundtracking a 25-year period when the gap between generations was utterly real and uncommonly vast. That dissonance gave rock music a distinctive, nonmusical importance for a long time. But that period is over. Rock — or at least the anthemic, metaphoric, Hard Rock Cafe version of big rock — has become more socially accessible but less socially essential, synchronously shackled by its own formal limitations. Its cultural recession is intertwined with its cultural absorption. As a result, what we’re left with is a youth-oriented music genre that a) isn’t symbolically important; b) lacks creative potential; and c) has no specific tie to young people. It has completed its historical trajectory. Which means, eventually, it will exist primarily as an academic pursuit. It will exist as something people have to be taught to feel and understand. I imagine a college classroom in 300 years, in which a hip instructor is leading a tutorial filled with students. These students relate to rock music with no more fluency than they do the music of Mesopotamia: It’s a style they’ve learned to recognize, but just barely (and only because they’ve taken this specific class). Nobody in the room can name more than two rock songs, except the professor. He explains the sonic structure of rock, its origins, the way it served as cultural currency and how it shaped and defined three generations of a global superpower. He shows the class a photo, or perhaps a hologram, of an artist who has been intentionally selected to epitomize the entire concept. For these future students, that singular image defines what rock was. So what’s the image? Certainly, there’s one response to this hypothetical that feels immediate and sensible: the Beatles. All logic points to their dominance. They were the most popular band in the world during the period they were active and are only slightly less popular now, five decades later. The Beatles defined the concept of what a \"rock group\" was supposed to be, and all subsequent rock groups are (consciously or unconsciously) modeled upon the template they naturally embodied. Their 1964 appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" is so regularly cited as the genesis for other bands that they arguably invented the culture of the 1970s, a decade when they were no longer together. The Beatles arguably invented everything, including the very notion of a band’s breaking up. There are still things about the Beatles that can’t be explained, almost to the point of the supernatural: the way their music resonates with toddlers, for example, or the way it resonated with Charles Manson. It’s impossible to imagine another rock group where half its members faced unrelated assassination attempts. In any reasonable world, the Beatles are the answer to the question \"Who will be the Sousa of rock?\" But our world is not reasonable. And the way this question will be asked tomorrow is (probably) not the same way we would ask it today. In Western culture, virtually everything is understood through the process of storytelling, often to the detriment of reality. When we recount history, we tend to use the life experience of one person — the \"journey\" of a particular \"hero,\" in the lingo of the mythologist Joseph Campbell — as a prism for understanding everything else. That inclination works to the Beatles’ communal detriment. But it buoys two other figures: Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. The Beatles are the most meaningful group, but Elvis and Dylan are the towering individuals, so eminent that I wouldn’t necessarily need to use Elvis’s last name or Dylan’s first. Still, neither is an ideal manifestation of rock as a concept. It has been said that Presley invented rock and roll, but he actually staged a form of primordial \"prerock\" that barely resembles the post-\"Rubber Soul\" aesthetics that came to define what this music is. He also exited rock culture relatively early; he was pretty much out of the game by 1973. Conversely, Dylan’s career spans the entirety of rock. Yet he never made an album that \"rocked\" in any conventional way (the live album \"Hard Rain\" probably comes closest). Still, these people are rock people. Both are integral to the core of the enterprise and influenced everything we have come to understand about the form (including the Beatles themselves, a group that would not have existed without Elvis and would not have pursued introspection without Dylan). In 300 years, the idea of \"rock music\" being represented by a two‐pronged combination of Elvis and Dylan would be equitable and oddly accurate. But the passage of time makes this progressively more difficult. It’s always easier for a culture to retain one story instead of two, and the stories of Presley and Dylan barely intersect (they supposedly met only once, in a Las Vegas hotel room). As I write this sentence, the social stature of Elvis and Dylan feels similar, perhaps even identical. But it’s entirely possible one of them will be dropped as time plods forward. And if that happens, the consequence will be huge. If we concede that the \"hero’s journey\" is the de facto story through which we understand history, the differences between these two heroes would profoundly alter the description of what rock music supposedly was. If Elvis (minus Dylan) is the definition of rock, then rock is remembered as showbiz. Like Frank Sinatra, Elvis did not write songs; he interpreted songs that were written by other people (and like Sinatra, he did this brilliantly). But removing the centrality of songwriting from the rock equation radically alters it. Rock becomes a performative art form, where the meaning of a song matters less than the person singing it. It becomes personality music, and the dominant qualities of Presley’s persona — his sexuality, his masculinity, his larger‐than‐life charisma — become the dominant signifiers of what rock was. His physical decline and reclusive death become an allegory for the entire culture. The reminiscence of the rock genre adopts a tragic hue, punctuated by gluttony, drugs and the conscious theft of black culture by white opportunists. But if Dylan (minus Elvis) becomes the definition of rock, everything reverses. In this contingency, lyrical authenticity becomes everything; rock is somehow calcified as an intellectual craft, interlocked with the folk tradition. It would be remembered as far more political than it actually was, and significantly more political than Dylan himself. The fact that Dylan does not have a conventionally \"good\" singing voice becomes retrospective proof that rock audiences prioritized substance over style, and the portrait of his seven‐decade voyage would align with the most romantic version of how an eclectic collection of autonomous states eventually became a place called \"America.\" These are the two best versions of this potential process. And both are flawed. There is, of course, another way to consider how these things might unspool, and it might be closer to the way histories are actually built. I’m creating a binary reality where Elvis and Dylan start the race to posterity as equals, only to have one runner fall and disappear. The one who remains \"wins\" by default (and maybe that happens). But it might work in reverse. A more plausible situation is that future people will haphazardly decide how they want to remember rock, and whatever they decide will dictate who is declared its architect. If the constructed memory is a caricature of big‐hair arena rock, the answer is probably Elvis; if it’s a buoyant, unrealistic apparition of punk hagiography, the answer is probably Dylan. But both conclusions direct us back to the same recalcitrant question: What makes us remember the things we remember? In 2014, the jazz historian Ted Gioia published a short essay about music criticism that outraged a class of perpetually outraged music critics. Gioia’s assertion was that 21st‐century music writing has devolved into a form of lifestyle journalism that willfully ignores the technical details of the music itself. Many critics took this attack personally and accused Gioia of devaluing their vocation. Which is odd, considering the colossal degree of power Gioia ascribes to record reviewers: He believes specialists are the people who galvanize history. Critics have almost no impact on what music is popular at any given time, but they’re extraordinarily well positioned to dictate what music is reintroduced after its popularity has waned. \"Over time, critics and historians will play a larger role in deciding whose fame endures,\" Gioia wrote me in an email. \"Commercial factors will have less impact. I don’t see why rock and pop will follow any different trajectory from jazz and blues.\" He rattled off several illustrative examples: Ben Selvin outsold Louis Armstrong in the 1920s. In 1956, Nelson Riddle and Les Baxter outsold \"almost every rock ’n’ roll star not named Elvis,\" but they’ve been virtually erased from the public record. A year after that, the closeted gay crooner Tab Hunter was bigger than Jerry Lee Lewis and Fats Domino, \"but critics and music historians hate sentimental love songs. They’ve constructed a perspective that emphasizes the rise of rock and pushes everything else into the background. Transgressive rockers, in contrast, enjoy lasting fame.\" He points to a contemporary version of that phenomenon: \"Right now, electronic dance music probably outsells hip‐hop. This is identical to the punk‐versus‐disco trade‐off of the 1970s. My prediction: edgy hip‐hop music will win the fame game in the long run, while E.D.M. will be seen as another mindless dance craze.\" Gioia is touching on a variety of volatile ideas here, particularly the outsize memory of transgressive art. His example is the adversarial divide between punk and disco: In 1977, the disco soundtrack to \"Saturday Night Fever\" and the Sex Pistols’ \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols\" were both released. The soundtrack to \"Saturday Night Fever\" has sold more than 15 million copies; it took \"Never Mind the Bollocks\" 15 years to go platinum. Yet virtually all pop historiographers elevate the importance of the Pistols above that of the Bee Gees. The same year the Sex Pistols finally sold the millionth copy of their debut, SPIN magazine placed them on a list of the seven greatest bands of all time. \"Never Mind the Bollocks\" is part of the White House record library, supposedly inserted by Amy Carter just before her dad lost to Ronald Reagan. The album’s reputation improves by simply existing: In 1985, the British publication NME classified it as the 13th‐greatest album of all time; in 1993, NME made a new list and decided it now deserved to be ranked third. This has as much to do with its transgressive identity as its musical integrity. The album is overtly transgressive (and therefore memorable), while \"Saturday Night Fever\" has been framed as a prefab totem of a facile culture (and thus forgettable). For more than three decades, that has been the overwhelming consensus. But I’ve noticed — just in the last four or five years — that this consensus is shifting. Why? Because the definition of \"transgressive\" is shifting. It’s no longer appropriate to dismiss disco as superficial. More and more, we recognize how disco latently pushed gay, urban culture into white suburbia, which is a more meaningful transgression than going on a British TV talk show and swearing at the host. So is it possible that the punk‐disco polarity will eventually flip? Yes. It’s possible everyone could decide to reverse how we remember 1977. But there’s still another stage here, beyond that hypothetical inversion: the stage in which everybody who was around for punk and disco is dead and buried, and no one is left to contradict how that moment felt. When that happens, the debate over transgressions freezes and all that is left is the music. Which means the Sex Pistols could win again or maybe they lose bigger, depending on the judge. \"There is a justice-driven part of my brain that believes — or needs to believe — that the cream rises to the top, and the best work endures by virtue of its goodness,\" argues the music writer Amanda Petrusich, author of \"Do Not Sell at Any Price,\" a dive into the obsessive world of 78 r.p.m. record collectors. \"That music becomes emblematic because it’s the most effective. When I think of rock and who might survive, I immediately think of the Rolling Stones. They’re a band that sounds like what we’ve all decided rock ’n’ roll should sound like: loose and wild. Their story reflects that ethos and sound: loose and wild. And also, they’re good.\" This is true. The Rolling Stones are good, even when they release records like \"Bridges to Babylon.\" They’ve outlived every band that ever competed against them, with career album sales exceeding the present population of Brazil. From a credibility standpoint, the Rolling Stones are beyond reproach, regardless of how they choose to promote themselves: They’ve performed at the Super Bowl, in a Kellogg’s commercial and on an episode of \"Beverly Hills, 90210.\" The name of the biggest magazine covering rock music was partly inspired by their sheer existence. The group members have faced arrest on multiple continents, headlined the most disastrous concert in California history and classified themselves (with surprisingly little argument) as \"the greatest rock and roll band in the world\" since 1969. Working from the premise that the collective memory of rock should dovetail with the artist who most accurately represents what rock music actually was, the Rolling Stones are a strong answer. But not the final answer. NASA sent the unmanned craft Voyager I into deep space in 1977. It’s still out there, forever fleeing Earth’s pull. No man‐made object has ever traveled farther; it crossed the orbit of Pluto in 1989 and currently tumbles through the interstellar wasteland. The hope was that this vessel would eventually be discovered by intelligent extraterrestrials, so NASA included a compilation album made of gold, along with a rudimentary sketch of how to play it with a stylus. A team led by Carl Sagan curated the album’s contents. The record, if played by the aliens, is supposed to reflect the diversity and brilliance of earthling life. This, obviously, presupposes a lot of insane hopes: that the craft will somehow be found, that the craft will somehow be intact, that the aliens who find it will be vaguely human, that these vaguely human aliens will absorb stimuli both visually and sonically and that these aliens will not still be listening to eight‐tracks. But it did guarantee that one rock song will exist even if the earth is spontaneously swallowed by the sun: \"Johnny B. Goode,\" by Chuck Berry. The song was championed by Ann Druyan (who later become Sagan’s wife) and Timothy Ferris, a science writer and friend of Sagan’s who contributed to Rolling Stone magazine. According to Ferris, who was the album’s de facto producer, the folklorist Alan Lomax was against the selection of Berry, based on the argument that rock music was too childish to represent the highest achievements of the planet. (I’m assuming Lomax wasn’t too heavily engaged with the debate over the Sex Pistols and \"Saturday Night Fever\" either.) \"Johnny B. Goode\" is the only rock song on the Voyager disc, although a few other tunes were considered. \"Here Comes the Sun\" was a candidate, and all four Beatles wanted it to be included, but none of them owned the song’s copyright, so it was killed for legal reasons. The fact that this happened in 1977 was also relevant to the song’s selection. \"Johnny B. Goode\" was 19 years old that year, which made it seem distinguished, almost prehistoric, at the time. I suspect the main reason \"Johnny B. Goode\" was chosen is that it just seemed like a reasonable track to select. But it was more than reasonable. It was, either deliberately or accidentally, the best possible artist for NASA to select. Chuck Berry may very well become the artist society selects when rock music is retroactively reconsidered by the grandchildren of your grandchildren. Let’s assume all the individual components of rock shatter and dissolve, leaving behind a hazy residue that categorizes rock ’n’ roll as a collection of memorable tropes. If this transpires, historians will reconstitute the genre like a puzzle. They will look at those tropes as a suit and try to decide who fits that suit best. And that theoretical suit was tailored for Chuck Berry’s body. Rock music is simple, direct, rhythm‐based music. Berry made simple, direct, rhythm‐based music. Rock music is black music mainstreamed by white musicians, particularly white musicians from England. Berry is a black man who directly influenced Keith Richards and Jimmy Page. Rock music is preoccupied with sex. Berry was a sex addict whose only American No. 1 single was about playing with his penis. Rock music is lawless. Berry went to prison twice before he turned 40. Rock music is tied to myth and legend (so much so that the decline of rock’s prominence coincides with the rise of the Internet and the destruction of anecdotal storytelling). Berry is the subject of multiple urban legends, several of which might actually be true and which often seem to involve cheapness, violence and sexual defecation. \"If you tried to give rock and roll another name,\" John Lennon famously said, \"you might call it Chuck Berry.\" That quote is as close as we come to a full‐on Sousa scenario, where the person and the thing are ideologically interchangeable. Chuck Berry’s persona is the purest distillation of what we understand rock music to be. The songs he made are essential, but secondary to who he was and why he made them. He is the idea itself.

Just ask the Pentagon, which has 10 big Nimitz-class supercarriers that it uses around the world to protect air and sea lanes and to mount airstrikes. There’s generally at least one of them stationed near the Middle East at all times. So, as other countries join in military action against extremists in the world’s hot spots, can’t they send their own carriers into action? Well, they could if they had any. But, aside from the 10 American giants, there’s currently only one big carrier in the whole world that can handle such a job — and it doesn’t belong to Britain, Russia or even China. It’s the Charles de Gaulle, the flagship and pride of the French Navy, and it’s been sent several times to join the fight against the Islamic State in Syria and in Libya. The carrier’s strike group performed so well in pounding the militants in the region that the United States Navy awarded it a Meritorious Unit Commendation in June. And President François Hollande of France announced on July 13 that the Charles de Gaulle would be redeployed to the Middle East this fall. Though it is nuclear-powered, the Charles de Gaulle isn’t quite a supercarrier — it’s shorter and much lighter, and doesn’t pack the same punch. But neither does it rate down among the small escort carriers and helicopter carriers that a number of navies employ. It is considered a medium-size fleet carrier, and these days, it has that category practically to itself. Russia has the Admiral Kuznetsov, but that ship has been plagued with mechanical problems and doesn’t leave port often, though there are reports that it will operate in the eastern Mediterranean in the autumn. A partially completed sister carrier was sold to China, but it has yet to complete trials. India has an older Russian castoff that rarely sails, and Brazil’s 50-year-old French-built fleet carrier, the São Paulo, is being refitted. Britain, which got out of the fleet carrier game years ago for cost reasons, is getting back in: A newly built carrier, which is larger than the Charles de Gaulle, is expected to be commissioned next year.

              "  'context': 'But the picture filled in six days later, when two 19-year-old men, arrested after running from the site of another fatal attack, identified the madrasa teacher as a fellow conspirator. That touched off a cascade of revelations that, for the first time, has allowed the Bangladeshi authorities to penetrate the murky world of the attackers and answer questions about the planning, execution and purpose of the attacks that have baffled the country — and, indeed, the world — since the violence began. Key Facts At least 39 people have been killed in attacks with machetes, guns and bombs since February 2013. The killings, mostly with machete blows to the back of the victim’s neck, have been accelerating lately, with five people murdered in April, four in May and at least three so far in June. On Sunday, a Christian grocer and the wife of a police superintendent who had been cracking down on militant attacks were killed in separate strikes. On Tuesday, a Hindu priest was killed in southwestern Bangladesh. In a lengthy interview, the chief of the police counterterrorism unit, Monirul Islam, who assumed his post in February, laid out the findings of his investigation in minute detail. The killings were organized by two militant Islamic groups that have gathered volunteers and recruits, trained them and eventually seeded them into cells run by a commander, Mr. Islam said. They have tried to pick their targets with care, with the aim of gaining support from the public, he said, and trained teams of killers. Their goal was to convert Bangladesh’s mixed secular and religious culture to an Islamist one, the chief investigator said. The Bangladeshi authorities say that they now believe they have identified the top leadership of the two groups they say are responsible, and that they are preparing to round them up. Only when the leaders are caught, they caution, will the attacks be stopped, and at that, only for a while if the appeal of Islamic fundamentalism is not blunted. Secular Versus Islamists Bangladesh, a nation with a Muslim majority adjoining eastern India, gained independence from Pakistan in a vicious war in 1971 and established a secular, democratic government. A military coup in 1975 led to more than three decades of mostly military-backed governments sympathetic to Islamic fundamentalists, until a secular government returned to power in 2009 with an overwhelming majority. But secularism is far from universally accepted in Bangladesh, and has always had to contend with a conservative Islamic culture. To a surprising extent, the militants have succeeded in their aim of discrediting secularism, the chief investigator said. \"In general, people think they have done the right thing, that it’s not unjustifiable to kill\" the bloggers, gay people and other secularists, he added. They have also put the secular government on the defensive. As a result, even as the government has condemned the killings, it has urged writers not to criticize Islam and warned that advocating \"unnatural sex\" is a criminal offense. Some experts say that only a more widespread crackdown will stop the killings, but that the government has held back, fearful of creating a backlash. \"The politics has been turned into the secular versus the Islamists,\" said Abdur Rashid, a retired army major general and executive director of the Institute of Conflict, Law and Development Studies in Dhaka. \"Therefore the government is cautious.\" While the killers’ strikes often appear random, Mr. Islam says the terrorism campaign was conceived by the militant groups quite deliberately as a response to mass protests in early 2013, known collectively as the Shahbag movement. Inspired by a group of bloggers who led the protests, the demonstrators advocated an end to religion-based politics and the prosecution of war crimes dating to the 1971 war for independence. War crimes prosecutions have been a particular source of anger for Islamists. They were shelved during the period of military-backed rule but revived under the new democratic government in 2009. Four of the five convicted and executed in the latest round of trials were leaders in the country’s largest Islamist political party, Jamaat-e-Islami, outraging Muslim fundamentalists and others. Two groups in particular took up the fight against secularism, Mr. Islam said. One, Ansar al-Islam, is led by a fiery cleric and a charismatic, well-trained operational commander, both of whom Mr. Islam declined to identify because they are being watched. Its leaders command about 25 trained killers, some of whom have been involved in three or four attacks, Mr. Islam said. The second, the Jama’atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, is the reorganized offshoot of a group banned in 2005 for setting off nearly 500 bombs simultaneously around the country. While both are radical Islamist groups, Mr. Islam said, neither seems to have direct links to larger terrorist networks like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, though those groups have occasionally claimed credit for the attacks. ‘It Is Your Duty to Kill’ The Islamist groups appear to have reacted quickly to the Shahbag movement, mounting their first fatal attack on Feb. 15, 2013, against a blogger who wrote critically of Islam under the pseudonym Thaba Baba. It was carried out by a group of students from North South University in Dhaka, who were incited by the sermons of the spiritual leader of Ansar al-Islam at the time, a 45-year-old cleric named Jasim Uddin Rahmani. The students used to attend his Friday speeches at a local mosque where Mr. Rahmani, who has since been arrested, declared a fatwa on bloggers critical of Islam, calling for them to be killed, Mr. Islam said. As it happened, one of the students, a 32-year-old senior named Redwanul Azad Rana, was also a leader in Ansar al-Islam, Mr. Islam said. He invited the younger students to Mr. Rahmani’s sermons and introduced them to the writings of Thaba Baba. \"Being a believer, it is your duty to kill\" Thaba Baba, Mr. Rana told the students, one of them said in his confession in court. Prodded by Mr. Rana, \"we made a plan to kill Islam’s and Prophet Muhammad’s insulter Thaba Baba by identifying him,\" the student, Faisal Bin Nayeem, 24, said in the statement. He said they found Thaba Baba’s picture on Facebook, then searched for someone matching it at the Shahbag protest, still underway at the time. Eventually, they identified a 32-year-old architect, Ahmed Rajib Haider, as Thaba Baba. After studying Mr. Haider’s routines, three of them surprised him outside his house around 9 p.m. Mr. Nayeem said he drove his machete into the back of Mr. Haider’s neck and hit him twice more as he fell forward. Ansar al-Islam, with the help of mainstream Islamist groups, then began to publicize Mr. Haider’s writings, casting the killers as defenders of Islam against \"atheist bloggers.\" The writings, published in at least two national dailies, enraged large segments of the population, who had previously been sympathetic to the Shahbag movement, Mr. Islam said. During the next two months, two more bloggers were killed. The police began arresting the North South University students who were involved in killing Mr. Haider, and also caught Mr. Rahmani, the cleric who inspired them. But Mr. Rana, the student leader, remains at large and is thought to have left the country. Mr. Islam said he believes these arrests stopped Ansar al-Islam — also known as the Ansarullah Bangla Team — from killing more people in 2013 and 2014. But the group reorganized the terrorist cells, he said, and the killing resumed. In February of last year, Mr. Islam said, Ansar attackers killed Avijit Roy, 42, an American citizen of Bangladeshi origin. Mr. Roy worked by day in the biotechnology industry in the United States and by night as a writer of books on science, homosexuality and religion, in addition to founding a website called Mukto-Mona, Bengali for freethinker. From the growing number of attackers in detention, the police learned that the newly reconstituted Ansar al-Islam had changed its tactics, now recruiting madrasa students and teachers instead of university students to carry out killings. Mr. Islam said a violent protest by the madrasa students in May 2013 convinced Ansar al-Islam leaders that they were a more promising source of fanatical recruits than their university counterparts. The training and indoctrination of the recruits became more rigorous and systematic at that time, Mr. Islam said. The cell that assassinated another blogger, Oyasiqur Rahman Babu, 27, just a month after Mr. Roy’s killing rented an apartment where two senior operatives worked with the group of would-be killers. One, an operations expert, taught them how to kill with a machete and use a pistol to scatter anyone interrupting the attack. Armed with Mr. Babu’s picture and his address, the assassins were sent to his home to assess the situation and returned to a barrage of questions from the trainer. \"What happens if you are stopped? What will you do?\" he asked them, Mr. Islam said. Close to the planned date of the attack, the other operative, an ideologist, introduced the killers to Mr. Babu’s writings. The students were given samples calculated to stir them up. \"What is the punishment for someone who writes these insults?\" the trainer asked them. The group answered in unison, day after day, \"Only death,\" the arrested students told investigators. Mr. Islam said the hardest part for the police was identifying the leaders, who were so concerned about security that they would not give their real names to the madrasa students they were training. Still, the police have now identified a trainer involved in planning the attack on Mr. Babu. Last month they printed the suspect’s picture, along with those of five others accused of participating in the killings, in local dailies, offering rewards of up to 500,000 takas, about $6,400, for information leading to their arrests. Costly Slip-Ups The other militant group, the reorganized Jama’atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, works independently of Ansar al-Islam and almost exclusively in northern Bangladesh, the chief investigator said. But the group is less professional than Ansar al-Islam, he said, making mistakes that are costing it public support. The group has trained 50 to 100 madrasa students as killers, he said, organizing them into cells of four or five. But through shoddy research, many of the victims have turned out to be popular local figures. Among them: a homeopathic doctor who used to give free treatment to villagers, and an English professor at Rajshahi University who was not known to have written critically of Islam. When detained militants learned that a 66-year-old Japanese man they had slaughtered had converted to Islam in 2015, they told investigators they were upset over their mistake. With all the slip-ups, the communities turned against them. With the public’s support, Mr. Islam said, the police quickly rounded up the suspected hit men and several of their handlers in most of the Jama’atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh killings, and were in pursuit of the senior leadership. Many in Bangladesh continue to live in terror. Twenty-five associates of one victim, a gay rights activist, have taken refuge in safe houses provided by diplomatic missions. Several dozen bloggers have fled the country. Those who remain have grown fatalistic. \"On this journey, we’ll lose our lives,\" Arif Jebtik, 39, one of the leaders of the Shahbag movement, said in an interview in his Dhaka apartment, which he rarely leaves. He has quit his job, closed his blog and stopped dropping his children off at school. \"This is the price we have to pay to history,\" he said.

              "  'context': 'The commoners of the ancient city of Pompeii may have eaten a varied diet, with the wealthier even dining on giraffe, new research suggests. Remains of food scraps found in the drains of Pompeii, Italy, a Roman city wiped out by a volcano, revealed that the middle- and lower-class residents dined on cheap but healthy foods, while slightly wealthier citizens dined on delicacies. The new findings belie the common belief that the Roman elite dined on exotic delicacies while poor Romans starved on birdseed. \"The traditional vision of some mass of hapless lemmings — scrounging for whatever they can pinch from the side of a street, or huddled around a bowl of gruel — needs to be replaced by a higher fare and standard of living, at least for the urbanites in Pompeii,\" study co-author Steven Ellis, a classics professor at the University of Cincinnati, said in a statement. Pompeii was a bustling Roman city that was buried in ash after the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Ellis and his colleagues excavated about 20 shop fronts near one of the once-bustling gates of Pompeii known as the Portia Stabia. The latrines and cesspits behind the food sellers revealed charred food waste from the kitchens, as well as human waste, that dated as far back as the fourth century B.C., when Pompeii was still in an early stage of development. [Preserved Pompeii: Photos Reveal City in Ash] Along with grains, the waste revealed that the commoners of Pompeii ate a simple, but fairly varied, Mediterranean diet that included lentils, olives, nuts and fish, as well as the odd scrap of salted meat. More upscale restaurants could be distinguished by the wider array of delicacies they served. \"The material from the drains revealed a range and quantity of materials to suggest a rather clear socioeconomic distinction between the activities and consumption habits of each property, which were otherwise indistinguishable hospitality businesses,\" Ellis said. For instance, the drains at a more central property contained traces of imported foods such as shellfish, sea urchin and even a giraffe\\'s leg. \"This is thought to be the only giraffe bone ever recorded from an archaeological excavation in Roman Italy,\" Ellis said. \"How part of the animal, butchered, came to be a kitchen scrap in a seemingly standard Pompeian restaurant not only speaks to long-distance trade in exotic and wild animals, but also something of the richness, variety and range of a nonelite diet.\" The team also found traces of exotic and imported spices that came from far-flung regions such as Indonesia.

Perhaps that’s what 22-year-old Melina Roberge and 28-year-old Isabelle Lagacé were shooting for when they posted photos from their world, documenting stops in Bermuda, Chile, Ecuador, and New York. However, things took a weird turn when the girls took a luxury cruise from England to Australia. When the sea princesses took their final stop in Sydney, somebody was waiting for these fair maidens, but it was not Prince Charming... First Selfie The two girls originally hail from Canada, and on their world travels, they took every possible opportunity to pose in bikinis, show beautiful sunsets, and take selfies like this one pictured here. What the beach babes didn’t know? There was somebody sinister keeping an eye on their well-documented travels. Exploring New Places \"Gone to a place very peaceful • leave a message after the tone,\" the sultry sunbather writes on Instagram where she posted this photo in late July. She might have been in a peaceful place back then, but rest assured she’s nowhere peaceful now. A View To Die For With water that blue, it’s easy to be hypnotized by the breathless sea below. But what happens when the vacation comes to a jarring close? Looking out across the endless expanse of blue skies meeting the crisp horizon of water can make one think they’re infallible. What happens when they find out they’re not? World Traveler \"Made some new Colombian friends,\" Melina writes on an Instagram post of tropical birds. Little did she know, some less friendly friends were watching these travels from a land far far away and much less exotic. Sea Princesses Now, if you’re going to go on a luxury vacation, traversing the globe and venturing across land and sea, you have to do it with as much style as possible. In this case, that swag came in the form of a luxury cruise ship. The MS Sea Princess was how these beautiful maidens chose to travel. Only the best for princesses of the sea... It’s All Smiles Until Something Goes Wrong It’s easy to sit back and admire life from under a coconut tree while all your friends back home admire your coconuts too, but pretty soon the party must come to an end. And Life Just Took An Ugly Turn Yes, as those beautiful young women pulled into port, the Australian Border Force had an ugly surprise waiting for them. Turns out these girls were doing more than just traveling the globe. They were carrying much more than memories with them. Travel Therapy While the beautiful women were traversing the globe and setting their sights high, they were also involved in a huge drug ring. The ladies were carrying 35 kilos of cocaine in their bags. And that’s not the worst of it... Collect Moments Not Things While the ladies were busy collecting moments and memories, 63-year-old André Tamine was planning on collecting the stash. It’s unclear how Tamine is connected with the girls, but he himself was holding 60 kilos of cocaine. Tattoo Time Police collected in total a 95-kilo bust, making this whopping bust the biggest Australian drug seizure ever coming through a passenger boat or airport. Perhaps the strangest past of this story is the documentation on social media. While these girls were getting tattoos in French Polynesia, the police were getting data on their whereabouts. Freedom And while they were enjoying the feelings of being young and free, those feelings weren’t going to last long. Police were onto these travelers from day one. Mounting Evidence Had the girls succeeded in their efforts, they would have made more money than they knew what to do with. Due to its geographical location, Australia has the highest drug prices anywhere in the world. It’s hard getting drugs to the lonely continent, so smugglers can charge a hefty price. But unfortunately for this crew, the evidence was mounting... More Evidence Two suitcases were seized by authorities. Each contained a significant amount of narcotics. Obviously, carrying such an amount of illegal drugs, and smuggling said drugs across international borders, was a major crime. Third Wheel 63-year-old Andre Tamine was the other smuggler involved in the scam. Like the girls, he too was from Quebec and likely orchestrated the exchange. One wonders if he was enjoying a vacation of his own while he was arranging to meetup with the young ladies... Stash Found The girls didn’t make many efforts to cleverly disguise their stash. Perhaps that’s why they were found out so easily. As soon as authorities opened the bag, the stash was uncovered and their lives were changes forever. Innocence? The funny thing is that the girls were instructed to keep their Instagram public and updated, which gave the media an unusual view into their drug-addled lives. Sure they look innocent as they vacation across the globe but who knew what hid just below the surface? Punishment According to a CBS News report, \"Roberge was sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months in prison before she is likely to be deported to Canada.\" And Isabelle was sentenced to \"to 7 ½ years in prison backdated to their arrest. Lagace will also likely be deported after serving a non-parole period of 4 ½ years.\" Lesson Learned The third accomplice of this story, Andre Tamin, was sentenced to eight years in prison for his crimes, according to a report from The Star.

The Beverly Hills auction house Julien’s Auctions announced the sale of the 1962 J-160E Gibson Acoustic guitar on Saturday and called it \"the most important Beatle guitar ever to hit the auction block.\" The guitar had been missing for 50 years, since it mysteriously disappeared after a concert 1963, according to a release from the auction house. Lennon originally purchased the guitar in 1962 for £161, and Beatles bandmate George Harrison bought an identical one at the same time. Lennon replaced his guitar with a 1964 model after the first one went missing. The guitar resurfaced after a man noticed similarities between a guitar in his collection to that of one in a magazine story about Harrison’s guitar collection, says the release.

              "  'context': \"Is a Harley-Davidson brew pub a smart marketing decision by the motorcycle maker? While brand extensions can be an effective way to incrementally increase revenues because they expand the business into new markets they were not already targeting, it only really works when they link naturally with the existing core brand. Harley's partnership with Ford for a limited-edition F-150 pickup truck was a smart blending of two American-made brands that complemented each other's strengths, even though it only ever made up 1% to 2% of Ford's F-150 sales. Harley's cake decorating kits, on the other hand, not so much. And it's not clear that a corporate blending of drinking and motorcycle riding leans more toward the pickup truck marketing venture than to being a Martha Stewart wannabe. Certainly, Harley-Davidson needs to do something to boost revenues. Its full year earning released a couple of weeks ago showed the big bike maker's sales were still in decline in the U.S., its biggest market, and profits were getting slashed. Revenues were down 2% in the fourth quarter and more than 4.5% across all of 2015, though part of that was due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. Yet it can't be denied lower sales here at home are hurting. U.S. motorcycle sales were down 4% for the quarter and almost 6% for the year. Finding other sources of revenue to supplement slumping bike sales will at least soften the blow. One smart way Harley is doing it is through clothing sales, specifically a new line of Harley-Davidson branded denim jeans through its Harley-Davidson MotorClothes Collection. That's the sort of brand extension that can work. The bike maker already sells almost $300 million worth of merchandise and apparel each year, and it was the one segment of its business last year that saw an increase in revenues (up more than 2%), currency exchange rates or not. Bikers already closely associate with the Harley brand, and wear everything from jackets and bandanas to shirts and gloves emblazoned with the H-D logo. And the reputed willingness of Harley enthusiasts to have the company's logo tattooed on their bodies is legendary. A brand of good quality jean, which is almost de rigeuer when riding anyway, is a natural way to branch out. A brew pub may not be. Cashing in on one of the hottest trends in alcohol makes sense. Craft beer is the one segment of the beer industry that is still generating broad appeal. According to the Brewers Association, the trade group representing the craft beer industry, there are over 4,100 breweries operating in the U.S. today, more than at any time in the country's history. Independent brewers also account for about 11% of all the beer brewed annually, and 19% of the industry's total market retail value. A business desiring to tap into that demand makes sense. Harley-Davidson doing so doesn't. The big motorcycle maker is reportedly taking over an abandoned 106,000 square foot Sam's Club store in Farmington Hills, Mich., with an idea to open a dealership that will serve as a destination location for the brand. In addition to selling motorcycles, which will occupy some two thirds of the space, Harley is also hoping to attract the previously mentioned brew pub as well as a gourmet market and maybe even a drive-in/ride-out movie theater. While Harley itself doesn't appear to be the one that will be running the bar, the association with drinking and riding shouldn't be one the bike maker wants associated with its brand. Recently rival Polaris Industries announced it would be making a limited edition Indian Motorcycle in honor of the 150th anniversary of Jack Daniel's whiskey. While that had some analysts scratching their heads over the decision, again because of linking drinking with motorcycle riding, it's being produced in very limited quantities and the proceeds from the auction of the very first bike produced in the run will be donated to a wounded veterans charity. It's still a relatively minor pairing of brands. Harley-Davidson's brand extensions here is once again an example of the bike maker running off the road in trying to juice sales. It may have looked at the demographics of the up-and-coming bike buyers, the urban, first time riders that include many women, and thought they'd be a natural fit for brew pubs and gourmet markets, but that's not likely the destination to where people are going to want to ride their Harleys. Its decision to get into jeans is a good fit, but having a dealership become a destination location to hangout is not likely. Though it's just one dealership at the moment, it represents the type of thinking that has gotten Harley-Davidson into the hole it currently finds itself in.

While it\\'s interesting to imagine pressing a big red button and -- poof! -- the internet goes out around the world, it\\'s actually much more complicated than that. It is possible, however, for people, companies and governments to turn off certain parts of the internet. There are countrywide blocks in places like Egypt and Gabon during political unrest, and temporary outages in India when the government turns off the internet while students take exams. Facebook (FB, Tech30) tracks these kinds of outages. Both internal monitoring and people on the ground contribute to this effort. Matt Perault, global head of policy at Facebook, started there in January 2011 -- around the time Egypt conducted widespread internet outages to quell protests. Over the next few years, he noticed that internet blocks were still happening with some frequency, just on a smaller scale. \"We felt they weren\\'t getting the attention they deserved,\" Perault said during a panel at the SXSW Interactive festival on Friday. \"So we work with a bunch of organizations to try and bring attention to this issue.\" It\\'s not just about losing access to Facebook.

There\\'s the protocol, which includes things like web hosts and providers, and then there are applications, like Facebook. Each of these layers have different responsibilities, as Perault and his fellow panelists explained, and countries or governments can target them differently. An internet service provider could stop serving a country, or a government could block specific services like Facebook or WhatsApp. In China, the \"great firewall\" blocks all kinds of content, including Facebook, Twitter, and the New York Times. In Gabon last year, nightly outages prevented people from connecting to any website. \"The problem is not the technology from a \\'turn off the entire internet perspective,\\'\" Perault said. \"But the technology has gotten more advanced in creating methods to impose a less costly block.\" Facebook\\'s internal group works with organizations like the Global Network Initiative to track these outages, and communicate them to a wider audience. Four out of five Facebook users are outside of the U.S., so many of them could be impacted by these blocks. For Facebook, figuring out where blocks happen is just good for business. Facebook said it is \"aware of at least 48 times in 2016 when access to Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram was disrupted. This includes both targeted disruptions, as well those impacting the entire Internet.\" The company said one of the most significant outages that it\\'s tracking right now is in certain regions of Cameroon, where it said internet connectivity has been down for 50 days. \"My main concern right now is moving to a world where there\\'s increasingly sophisticated small-scale blocks,\" Perault said.

              "  'context': 'LONDON — The president\\'s address to a distraught nation in the midst of a surprise military coup was being interrupted, not by gunshots or protestors, but an incoming call. On Saturday at half-past-midnight, Nuh Yilmaz, press officer for Turkey\\'s national intelligence agency, called CNN Türk anchor Hande Firat on her mobile phone. He didn\\'t realize that he was interrupting a FaceTime call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Moreover, he didn\\'t know that the phone was being held up to a CNN studio camera in Ankara and broadcast around the world. Firat\\'s index finger could be seen awkwardly and repeatedly pressing her iPhone\\'s menu button in the hope that Yilmaz\\'s name would disappear from the screen. SEE ALSO: Periscope and Facebook Live help document attempted coup in Turkey In the background, the president’s voice carried on, speaking from an undisclosed location somewhere in the Turkish resort town of Marmaris. Finally, flustered and confused, Firat jabbed her middle finger at the ‘end call’ button, sending the intelligence agency to voicemail. The president’s address to his distraught nation in the midst of a surprise military coup could now continue without interruption. Erdogan’s FaceTime call was bizarre, but revealing. It laid bare the calculus of a president whose support is heavily built on the ubiquity of his own face. The giant presidential portraits that have sprouted up on the country’s major boulevards in the last two years are a testament to this. And now, sequestered in a dull, white room with no camera crews on hand, he desperately needed a way to show his face. So his staff pulled out an iPhone and opened FaceTime. About three hours earlier, shortly after the first tanks rolled into Istanbul and Ankara, there was a moment when it seemed that everyone knew what was coming. This is your first coup...Don\\'t be worried Military coups were a common feature in the Turkish experience of the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Late Friday night into early Saturday morning, suburban parents called their children who were working or studying in the city to walk them through the process. Dogan, a 28-year-old engineer in Istanbul, told Mashable in an interview that his mother told him and his girlfriend not to panic. \"This is your first coup,\" Dogan\\'s mother told them. \"We have been through many. So I just wanted to say, don’t be worried, ok?\" Dogan requested that his last name be withheld due to the volatile political situation. Melis, a 26-year-old Turk living in New England, was terrified when she phoned home. Her parents reassured her by saying they already know the drill, she told Mashable. She also requested her last name be withheld for fear of repercussions for her family in Turkey. Activating VPNs As families were coping with the unrest, reporters and activists were switching their conversations over to WhatsApp and activating VPNs. People chant slogans as they gather at a pro-government rally in central Istanbul\\'s Taksim square, Saturday, July 16, 2016. Image: Emrah Gurel/AP This, too, was a strategy based on experience. Erdogan once described social media as a \"knife in the hand of a murderer,\" and common communications apps like Facebook Messenger and Twitter are routinely blocked by court order in Turkey at the slightest disturbance to national security. With such disturbances becoming more frequent and extreme, authorities have more recently done away with court orders altogether, choosing to \"throttle\" social media services by slowing them down unilaterally. This was particularly handy in last night’s attempted coup, when court orders were in danger of becoming irrelevant. At 10:50 p.m., Dyn, an internet performance tracking service, reported that the throttling had begun. And then all assumptions were overturned. The throttling subsided, albeit inconsistently. Binali Yildirim, Turkey’s prime minister and Erdogan’s loyal ally, was tweeting furiously. The president was retweeting from his account, and he was also composing Facebook posts. When the president appeared on FaceTime, it became necessary for other politicians to also appear on FaceTime. Abdullah Gül, a former president, was interviewed by CNN Türk on a 5-inch screen via FaceTime. Lawmakers scurrying around the parliament building in Ankara were calling into CNN Türk via FaceTime, with explosions being heard in the background. It was a phenomenon that echoed the American CNN’s peculiar obsession with ‘holograms’ for one month during the 2008 presidential election, but this time fueled by Turkey\\'s presidential personality cult and the abundance of unlimited 3G internet plans. Erdogan borrowed his enemy\\'s tactics Erdogan’s own aides, like the journalists and activists they so revile, were switching their conversations over to WhatsApp and reaching out to as much of the President’s conservative base as they could. At around two o’clock in the morning, Istanbul’s thousands of minarets came to life. Imams issued calls on the loudspeaker for citizens to get out of their homes and show the military that they support their president. The calls were streamed and tweeted and the tides suddenly shifted. Outside, where soldiers were previously disarming police officers, police officers were now arresting soldiers. Pro-coup protesters were overwhelmed by pro-government protesters under the sonic boom of fighter jets zooming out of the urban airspace. The soldiers that instigated the coup had followed an old playbook, seizing media offices, shutting down bridges and airports, and trying to occupy physical territory. The President drew instead from the methods of the young, educated, urban elites who so frequently oppose him by focusing on a more virtual Turkey. With his back to the wall in Marmaris, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who condemned social media activists as knife-wielding murderers, decided to pick up the knife.

There is even evidence of him predicting Trump’s presidential win, whom he referred to as \"the great shameless, audacious bawler\". His prophecies, which he wrote in four-line verse, are of course open to interpretation – but here are some verses that could possibly shed a little light on what we can expect in 2017:  For forty years the rainbow will not be seen. For forty years it will be seen every day. The dry earth will grow more parched, and there will be great floods when it is seen. The great man will be struck down in the day by a thunderbolt. An evil deed, foretold by the bearer of a petition. According to the prediction another falls at night time. Conflict at Reims, London, and pestilence in Tuscany.

After weeks of divisive campus-wide debate, the board voted late Monday to end university-paid coverage in 2014, while providing an option for employees to seek out abortion coverage at their own expense. The controversial decision at LMU, a Catholic university in Los Angeles, has dissatisfied individuals on both sides of the issue. Anna Muraco, an associate professor of sociology at LMU, said that the debate was \"missing some of the larger issues that are at stake here -- issues like equity\" and diversity, the Daily Breeze reports. Abortion \"is legal and safe,\" she said. \"There’s something disingenuous by the way this (issue) has been framed. ... They claim to be an institution that respects diversity and religious plurality, and we did not have to sign any kind of faith statement like other (Catholic) schools have.\" However, equally dissatisfied on the other side of the debate was Christopher Kaczor, philosophy professor at LMU, who said the university cannot have it both ways. \"The decision basically is something like this: we think abortion is intrinsically evil and wrong so we’re not going to drive you there, but let me arrange for my brother to take you there if you give him a couple bucks he’ll take care of you,\" he said to CBS. LMU\\'s trustees said that employees will be able to select a Third Party Administrator (TPA)-managed plan that will cover elective abortions. Employees who select this plan will pay a slightly higher premium, which will ensure that no LMU dollars will go towards elective abortions. In a letter, the trustees wrote that their decision is in line with the church\\'s \"core teaching on the dignity of every human being at all stages of life.\" The letter continued, \"however, we also want to reaffirm clearly that we are a university in which diversity, academic freedom, free discourse, unencumbered pursuit of truth and engaged debate on important contemporary issues are part of our very nature and key to our success.\" Last month, Pope Francis said the church had grown \"obsessed\" with abortion to the detriment of its larger mission to be \"home for all.\" \"We have to find a new balance,\" he said.

In fact, transportation is the second-highest cost many households face. Car costs, however, varies greatly from state to state. According to Bankrate, Iowa is the best state for drivers. The site came to its conclusion after analyzing factors like commute time, annual insurance premiums, gas, cost of repairs, car thefts and the number of fatal crashes. Bankrate Ohio, Maine, Wisconsin, Vermont and Minnesota round out the top five best states for drivers. Iowa took the top spot, scoring a perfect 10 in the category of insurance affordability, with the average Iowan spending about $647 a year for coverage. In comparison, the most expensive state for insurance is New Jersey, where drivers can expect to pay around $1,300 a year. If your car is on the fritz, it’s also cheaper to fix it in Iowa. Bankrate reports that the average cost of a repair is just $358. This figure is about $77 cheaper than a repair in California, which is the most expensive state to get your car fixed at $435 per repair. Speaking of California, the Golden State was identified as the worst state for drivers. In addition to the high cost of repairs, the average cost of insurance is about $895 a year, and filling up the gas tank costs the average Californian $1,260 annually. While the cost of driving a car in California is more expensive, another reason it landed at the bottom of the list is crime.

She wrote the book on it -- literally. And while she navigates the new terrain of publishing, we're taking notes from her work titled, like her blog, Elements Of Style. The biggest takeaway: We pretty much want her life, and after a brief chat with her, we're certain of it. In the book you talk about your first blog post on April 3, 2007. Tell us what you were doing before that. What did your life and career path look like? Oh, a lot of things! I knew I wanted to do something creative and visual, but wasn't quite sure just what. I had worked in an art gallery, interned for a fashion designer, assisted another Boston interior designer and did event planning for a private school. I started my blog while at the private school job as a way to keep my creative fires stoked. And then finally one day, my husband gave me the courage to quit my job and focus on starting my own design company and growing the blog. My dad took a similar path -- he taught himself architectural design while working in the family business and then one day the design work trumped everything else, and he never looked back. So I grew up with a great role model to follow. The book title promises to show us how to design a home and a life. How are they similar? Homes are the palette on which we can illustrate our life stories. Every home should reflect your own journey, and not just look like everyone else's home. The process of moving around, growing up, figuring out what you want and then expressing that is true both in life and interior design. For me right now, I have this empty third bedroom just waiting to be a nursery, but I've been struggling to get pregnant. That room reflects my current life story, while the other rooms look pretty perfect. If you could pinpoint one moment that set you on this path, what would it be? Probably the day I realized that complete strangers were reading my blog, not just my mom and girlfriends. People were asking me for advice and I was thrilled to give it. That joyous feeling pointed me right to what I should be doing, which is both designing and writing! What's the biggest challenge staying the course? With design, it's stress. People think interior design is all rainbows and wallpaper and dollar bills. It's not. It's 75 percent paperwork and business planning, and 25 percent creativity. And the pressure to perform is intense -- you're spending other people's hard-earned money! You lose sleep hoping they are happy. What's one thing you do everyday without fail? Light delightful smelling candles and make my bed. I just completed an amazing master bedroom addition and I show it the utmost respect right now. But check in with me in a few months and I probably will have reverted to being sloppier. The 'Elements Of Style' Can Be Found In This One Instagram Account\",\n",

If you’d asked me 15 years ago if the sexiest profession would have included the words \"data\" and \"scientist\" in the title, I probably would have laughed If I want to know the projected residential price increase of Hoxton Park, the types of housing preferred by first-home buyers, or the configuration of a residential apartment that will get the most interest, our team can pull the data, develop statistical models and tell me the answers. As someone who holds a fascination for \\xadfuture trends, it’s hard not to be impressed. Recently, our data scientists have been looking at the probability of someone selling their home. Supply of housing, whether it is new dwellings or new listings, is often seen as simply a result of demand. Enough demand will push up prices and either prompt people to sell or allow developers to get a large enough margin to put up more housing. When listing a home, we know strong demand is not the only driver to sell, and a more complex analysis is required. The owner ultimately wants the best price possible, but other factors also \\xadfeature, including a mix of market drivers and personal drivers. These can include the demographic of the household, sales activity in the street the house is in, and the rental yield the house achieves or could achieve. By looking at these drivers in isolation, it is hard to determine a market trend, but give a data scientist a computer, loads of data and a modelling package and chances are they can work it out. Right now we’re seeing high clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne, but this is not necessarily translating into new listings. Melbourne, in particular, had fewer auctions last week than it has had for a while, as owners of property appear to be holding off for a variety of reasons. While they have many great \\xadattributes, what makes them most irresistible is their ability to tell the future This could be because they \\xadbelieve they will get a better price in spring, or perhaps they are deciding to hold on to properties longer because they think there is still price growth in the market. In reality, the reasons are complex and show high variability across and within each capital city. If you’d asked me 15 years ago if the sexiest profession would have included the words \"data\" and \"scientist\" in the title, I probably would have laughed. But luckily we now have lots of irresistible data scientists to help us work it out and interpret the numbers, enabling us to continually supply better and more relevant information to both buyers and sellers.

The move was made possible in large part by CommonBond’s acquisition of Gradible, a company that allows borrowers to compare student loan repayment options. With the new technology, CommonBond will become part of a growing cottage industry of startups billing themselves as middle men for companies who want to offer student loan help as a perk to employees. \"That’s a large part of the future of where this industry is going,\" said David Klein, the chief executive at CommonBond, which also offers the perk to its employees. Getting in the employee student loan repayment business allows CommonBond to reach borrowers who may not qualify or be interested in refinancing their loans, he said. Employers pay a fee to CommonBond to use their platform, which allows companies to pay a worker’s student loan servicer directly. CommonBond’s announcement is the latest sign companies are wagering that employer student loan help could be big business. More than half of current students and recent college graduates said they would prefer a company offer student loan help than a health plan, according to a September survey from IonTuition, a company that helps borrowers manage their student loans. Nearly half said CommonBond’s announcement is the latest sign companies are wagering that employer student loan help could be big business. More than half of current students and recent college graduates said they would prefer a company offer student loan help than a health plan, according to a September survey from IonTuition, a company that helps borrowers manage their student loans. Nearly half said they would prefer student loan help to a 401(k) . And the more than 40 million Americans coping with $1.3 trillion in student debt offers a huge potential pool of workers who could benefit from the perk. \"It is in its infancy,\" Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Cappex.com, a college and scholarship search site, said of the industry surrounding employee student loan benefits. \"But it is attracting a lot of interest because the prospective employees, the millennials, are really interested in it.\" In 2015, just 3% of employers offered student loan repayment assistance, according to the Society of Human Resource Managers, but that number appears poised to grow. Already some major employers, including mutual fund firm Fidelity and consulting firmPwC are offering the perk and the benefit has the potential to turn into the next 401(k) with some help from Congress, Kantrowitz said. Employers who offer a student loan repayment benefit through CommonBond will also be able to provide their employees with a tool powered by the lender that they can use to sort through their student loan repayment options. Borrowers can sync their loan information with the tool and then use it to see how much their monthly payments would be under various repayment programs. The repayment options featured on the tool include refinancing, a service that CommonBond offers. Borrowers will also be able to use the tool to get more information about repayment programs offered by the federal government, Klein said. Though CommonBond doesn’t stand to benefit directly from a borrower choosing a government program, the tool will expose borrowers to CommonBond who may not qualify for refinancing or for whom it doesn’t make sense. Of course as is the case with any personal finance tool provided by a company with a vested interest in one of its offerings, borrowers should keep that knowledge in the forefront of their mind when evaluating the options presented, Kantrowitz said. \"If a lender gives you a tool that says refinance with us, you need to take that with a grain of salt because it may be no more than marketing,\" he said.

In the comics, Robbie is a high school student working at an auto body shop, who tries to make a better life for him and his brother Gabe, who is in a wheelchair, by entering a street race, only to be gunned down. \"With Doctor Strange coming out this year, the Marvel Universe is moving into new waters,\" Whedon told EW after the show’s panel at Comic-Con on Friday. \"We felt that this was obviously a great character that we’d love to have on our show that we feel fits with that shift.\" For the uninitiated, in the titular film and its sequel, Nicolas Cage portrayed the first Ghost Rider, stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze. Reyes, on the other hand, drives a muscle car. \"We decided to go with the Robbie Reyes version of the character because he’s a newer comic, and also it would be interesting to bring in someone with that background into our dynamic of the show,\" Tancharoen said. The All-New Ghost Rider comics reveal that Robbie is a different kind of Ghost Rider. Instead of being possessed by a Spirit of Vengeance, he’s taken over by a Satanic serial killer. The S.H.I.E.L.D. bosses, however, were shy to say whether they’ll go down that same path. \"We’re staying true to his circumstance,\" Tancharoen said. \"But as always with any property that we use, we’re taking our liberties with it.\" \"We’re pulling a little bit from different versions of the Ghost Rider,\" Whedon added. \"There’s an iconic image that we saw at Comic-Con of that skull on fire.

We’re being true to the character, where he comes from, his little brother.\" As to whether Robbie will cross paths with the Inhuman James (Axle Whitehead), a.k.a. Hellfire, who, like Ghost Rider, also uses a Hellfire-enchanted chain, the producers stayed mum. \"That’s a very interesting point,\" Whedon would only offer.

For instance, \"people are driving and it\\'s frustrating. They get to work and the emotions they felt in their car influences what they do in their offices. Or they invest money based on emotions that stem from things unrelated to their investments,\" study researcher Stéphane Côté, a professor in the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, said in a statement. \"But our investigation reveals that if they have emotional intelligence, they are protected from these biases.\" Emotional intelligence is a term used in psychology to signal the ability to identify and control both your and others\\' emotions, and to apply that ability to certain tasks, according to Psychology Today. For the study, published in the journal Psychological Science, researchers conducted several experiments to evaluate how different levels of emotional intelligence influence decision-making. In one experiment, researchers found that anxiety\\'s effect on a decision involving risk -- when that anxiety was unrelated to the decision at hand -- seemed to be blocked in people with high emotional intelligence. For people with low emotional intelligence, on the other hand, anxiety seemed to influence the decision-making. The researchers said that emotional intelligence can likely help you stop any emotions -- not just negative ones, like stress and anxiety, but also good ones, like excitement -- from influencing unrelated decisions. \"People who are emotionally intelligent don\\'t remove all emotions from their decision-making,\" Côté said in the statement. \"They remove emotions that have nothing to do with the decision.\" Indeed, a 2008 study published in the Journal of Consumer Research also showed that emotional intelligence could play a role in decision-making by helping people realize their emotions can sway the choices they make.

It's a beautiful manufacturing process to watch, but because of the way the Eames Molded Shell Chair is finished, you never actually see the design of the skeleton underneath.

Woven together with threads of threads of ultra-strong, reinforced polymer, the Sofa shows off the Eames skeleton by stripping away the skin. Although the Eameses never designed a sofa in the style of their fiberglass shell armchairs, they did design prototypes sometime in the 1950s, which are still on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. Because of the amount of fiberglass needed to make the Eames Sofa sturdy enough to hold multiple sitters, Herman Miller ultimately decided not to manufacture the product.

              "  'context': 'A photo identifying effort by Canada\\'s national archives that started in the country\\'s remote north is helping name indigenous Canadians in archival images - and bringing the country a step closer to reconciliation by correcting historical wrongs. Janet Brewster did not expect to see a baby photo of her mother in a press release. But there she was, Ms Brewster was sure of it, her mother Betty\\'s chubby arms resting on her older sister\\'s back, eyes looking directly at the camera. \"It was the eyes, eyebrows and hair that really struck me and I thought \\'Oh my gosh, that has to be my mom,\\' because it looked so much like my youngest son,\" she says. Ms Brewster emailed the image to her mother, now 69, who confirmed it was indeed her as a child, along with Ms Brewster\\'s aunt Bella, their two brothers and a third, still unnamed, boy. The image of the siblings, a snapshot taken when the family was living in a remote Hudson\\'s Bay Company trading post and spent many of their days together, was being used by Library and Archives Canada to promote Project Naming, an initiative to help communities identify indigenous Canadians captured in photos in the archive\\'s extensive collection. That coincidence eventually led Betty Brewster to identifying a handful of other previously anonymous Inuit people in digitised images at the national archives, and other images of her and Bella, now 78. \"It started with that first photograph,\" Ms Brewster says. Project Naming was first launched as a small one-off project with the goal of identifying Inuit people from the territory of Nunavut who had been photographed by Canadian government bureaucrats and employees working in the far north from the late 1800s to the mid-20th century. The images rarely made their way back to the remote communities, but eventually ended up in the national archives, a repository responsible for collecting all significant government records in need of preservation. As was convention at the time, many of the white people in the images were named for the record. The indigenous subjects were not. \"Most photos were described as being native, native-type, half-breed, Eskimo, or simply ignored in the photographs,\" says Beth Greenhorn, who has been heading the project for the archives since 2003. \"Terminology has changed and, because we are dealing with historical records that were created decades ago, I find it a bit painful to go through.\" Updating the official record and terminology is one part of the project. The other is helping youth connect with their community elders to better understand their past. Ms Brewster says most of her family now knows the names of the children in the old images. Like family photos do, the images spurred a conversation about what their lives were like and where they were living. Among the stories they shared with their family were Betty Brewster\\'s time as an interpreter-translator for the Nunavut land claims agreement that led to the creation of Canada\\'s newest territory. \"When you talk about reconciliation and about moving forward as a country and as indigenous people, Inuit people living in this country, naming people in those historic photographs is so important,\" Ms Brewster says. \"When you acknowledge people have names, it lends more credence to their life experience.\" The project was inspired by Murray Angus, who oversaw a college programme for Inuit youth that brought them to the Canadian capital of Ottawa to study Inuit history, land claims, culture and language. In the early days of the project, the pictures were transferred onto CDs and brought north by the students to be shared at community gatherings and to visits to elders for identification. The project now uses social media outreach on Twitter and Facebook, where people can share the photos and offer clues. Ms Greenhorn says it gives her \"goosebumps\" when she sees someone recognise a family member or even a photograph of their much younger selves in the images. \"It is this very elemental human reaction that it just drives the project forward,\" she says. Images, now posted weekly, showcase the austere beauty of Canada\\'s Arctic regions and its people, and glimpses into the past lives of ndigenous Canadians across what was a largely rural nation. They also portray some of the darker parts of Canada\\'s relationship with its indigenous people, including photos of children in the residential school system, which removed them from their homes and aimed to eliminate their culture. The project is now entering its 15th year and has been expanded to include anonymous photographs from First Nations, Metis and Inuit people across Canada and all its northern territories. Since the project\\'s launch in 2002, about 10,000 images have been digitised. More than 2,500 people, places, and activities they are participating in have been identified. Ms Greenhorn admits the number does not seem high but believes that each person named counts. \"Some of these portraits are so beautiful and they represent a life that was lived, someone that\\'s contributed to their community that had a family and to not have a name for them is sad,\" she says. \"So when you do make a connection, when you get a name and add it to the record it\\'s exciting and you think OK - there\\'s one more done.\" Canada\\'s Project Naming: Identifying the unidentified',\n",

Now, he’s not \"fat\" by any means. In fact, his broad shoulders suggests that he balances his pizza intake with bench presses and curls. So how does this body occur and how do you undo a \"dadbod?\" The dadbod first came into light because some women actually found dadbod it hotter than the ultra-ripped ken doll look. Many people agreed, some disagreed, and the entire fitness world went into a tizzy. Basically, it was the black-dress-blue-dress of physique preference. But let’s say you, the once-fit-and-now-aging fella, have found yourself with this particular body type and don’t like it, and want to get a bit more in shape. What do you do? Rest easy: You actually have it easier than most. How Fitbods Turn Into Dadbods Many who gain weight over the years blame their metabolism. With dadbods, however, metabolism usually isn’t the issue. We’ve explained before that your resting metabolism (the amount of calories that you burn just living) accounts for 70% of total calories. On top of that, 85% of this number can be explained by fat free mass, or more simply how much muscle you have. Sure, metabolisms do decrease as people age, but only if there is an accompanied loss of muscle a condition known as sarcopenia, in which you lose muscle mass each year after the age of 50. The signature of a dadbod is that there is undoubtedly a good amount of muscle underneath the \"flab.\" So how do once-athletic bodies turn into dadbods? There are three possible explanations: You’re burning fewer calories. Sure, we’ve talked about the fact that exercise is probably not a great means for weight loss. However, if you were a former athlete for example (which many dadbod-wielding folks are) and keep your original caloric intake while no longer playing sports, weight will start to creep on. Sure, we’ve talked about the fact that exercise is probably not a great means for weight loss. However, if you were a former athlete for example (which many dadbod-wielding folks are) and keep your original caloric intake while no longer playing sports, weight will start to creep on. You’re taking in more calories (due to your environment). Let’s face it. When many people get older and have more disposable income, that income gets spent on food. Social events too revolve around food, and there’s a lot more imbibing that occurs. Let’s face it. When many people get older and have more disposable income, that income gets spent on food. Social events too revolve around food, and there’s a lot more imbibing that occurs. You started lifting and there’s muscle under that flub. It’s possible that someone at a higher BMI started a lifting regimen, made no change to diet, then developed more muscle. While it looks like they deteriorated into a \"dadbod,\" it might have actually been an upgrade over what some would call \"skinny fat.\" Basically, the dadbod has nothing to do with changes in metabolism, and everything to do with changes in life as you age. How to Reverse a Dadbod This part is easy. Dadbods have the ultimate advantage. They are men with a good amount of muscle tone, which means that they have a higher metabolism. Out of any single persona, the dadbod is physiologically the easiest when it comes to weight loss. If you have a dadbod and feel like weight loss is difficult, try being a 5’3 180-lb woman then get back to me. Sponsored Really, all dadbods have to do is use determine the number of calories they need every day to lose weight—which will still be a lot—whilst simultaneously keeping their protein high. Of course individuals may encounter particular difficulties. Perhaps mindfulness is an issue, for example, but I am being terse here for a reason. You have it easier than anyone else when it comes to losing weight. Obese individuals, those who can’t even develop a dadbod, and pretty much all women have it dozens of times harder. Of course, perhaps you enjoy your dadbod and don’t want to change it. That’s okay too. But if you do, you are at an elite echelon of weight loss candidates, so don’t take that for granted.

China's Tiangong-1 space station has been orbiting the planet for about 5 years now, but recently it was decommissioned and the Chinese astronauts returned to the surface. In a press conference last week, China announced that the space station would be falling back to earth at some point in late 2017. Normally, a decommissioned satellite or space station would be retired by forcing it to burn up in the atmosphere. This type of burn is controlled, and most satellite re-entries are scheduled to burn up over the ocean to avoid endangering people. However, it seems that China's space agency is not sure exactly when Tiangong-1 will re-enter the atmosphere, which implies that the station has been damaged somehow and China is no longer able to control it. This is important because it means Tiangong-1 won't be able to burn up in a controlled manner. All we know is it will burn up at some point in late 2017, but it is impossible to predict exactly when or where. This means that there is a chance debris from the falling spacecraft could strike a populated area. Fortunately, it's unlikely anyone will be injured.

Things we hated about MoMA\\'s Rain Room: the six-hour long lines that formed outside the exhibit, how its \"viral\" status tended to overshadow the rest of EXPO: 1 New York, and the way it slowly transformed from an art show to the perfect Instagram backdrop. So, do we want Yayoi Kusama\\'s current NYC artworks, two versions of her very popular \"Infinity Rooms,\" to turn into Rain Room, part deaux? Queues have already been forming inside of David Zwirner gallery, where admirers are attempting to get into \"Infinity Mirrored Room -- The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away\" and \"Love Is Calling.\" The first is an isolated space occupied by reflective surfaces and twinkling lights, reminiscent of The Whitney\\'s previous Kusama-centric installation, \"Fireflies on the Water.\" The other is a room covered in spotted, tentacled sculptures and filled with Kusama\\'s voice echoing through the whimsical ecosystem. Visitors are only allowed around 40 seconds in each of the chambers, which is a brief foray compared to the limitless time onlookers were given to gaze at MoMA\\'s rain storm. According to The Wall Street Journal, docents are urging those in line for the \"Infinity Rooms\" to wait patiently inside the gallery, but away from the other 27 paintings on display in \"I Who Have Arrived in Heaven.\" \"We\\'re not going to ask people to stand outside in the rain,\" said Hanna Schouwink, a gallery partner who worked on the exhibition. \"I hope it\\'s not going to get too cold, because we\\'ll be in trouble here.\" On the one hand, we strive to be champions of democratized art. In our opinion, the more accessible and available an art project, the better, so we\\'re happy to see bustling crowds flock to Kusama\\'s artworks. During a press preview for the exhibition, Kusama herself beseeched journalists and art admirers to bring as many eyes to her work as possible. \"I would like to work with you together to make that happen, to deliver the joy of the art and love and peace to people who are suffering and don’t have the opportunity to enjoy the joy of the art,\" she stated. But on the other hand, it\\'s difficult to consider the throngs of people waiting to ponder infinity, merely loitering around the dotted universe Kusama creates with her painted masterpieces. Her canvases show off a multitude of eyeballs, polka dots and lines exploding before your eyes in a flurry of neon colors; frenetic visions that Kusama rather ambitiously intends as purveyors of world peace, universal happiness and solidarity. If you\\'re a longtime fan of Kusama\\'s polka-dotted point of view, you\\'ll want to head to Chelsea before Rain Room-esque madness descends upon us all. Paintings like \"Praying for Peace in the World\" and \"A Woman With Pink Hair\" are populated by new and ever-fantastical characters that evoke heightened levels of joy.

              "  'context': 'Photos of men with one painted finger nail have been all over social media in the last year leaving people to question their intentions until they learned the heartwarming meaning behind this hype. Nail it to end it Men all over the world have united in a single cause – to help raise awareness about child abuse. By weekly painting one finger nail of their choice in any color they prefer, they are standing up for one in five children becoming victims to sexual abuse. The campaign quickly spread outside Australia where it initially started showing men everywhere displaying their willingness to make a change, and some great fashion sense too. The inspiration Aside from presenting one in five children falling victim to abuse, there is another meaningful symbolism behind painting a finger nail. It started when Elliot Costello went to Cambodia as a part of Hagar International project for helping poverty-stricken regions. There he met a girl named Thea whom he soon became friends with. During one of their conversations, as she was painting his nails, he learned that she was victim of sexual abuse on daily basis while living in an orphanage. That was the moment that he decided to try to make a stop to this global issue. Inspired by her story and her favorite activity, he designed the campaign aimed to raise awareness and funds, provide recovery and care for victims, and ultimately, prevent child abuse. Polished up men The Polished Man Project is focused toward aspiring men to polish up as great role models, great fathers, brothers and friends in order to build a better world where not a single child suffers abuse. As a slogan on The Polished Man website reads, it \"challenges men to nail it to end it.\" By taking action, men are re-writing the abuser role they most often have in cases of sexual assaults, and instead of perpetuating the horror by ignoring it, they are standing up for and giving voice to the quieted. Even though the campaign depicts only men, women are encouraged by the Polished Man Project to join men by supporting and praising them as \"positive masculinity\" role-models with a hashtag #ipreferapolishedman. According to the Polished Man Report for 2015, the movement helped raise $261,933.00 in USA only, making it a 60% fundraising growth on 2014. By reaching more people each painted fingernail at a time, the movement could soon reach its goal of becoming global and providing each child with safe and violent-free childhood.

It might seem like a silly thing, but it’s much more difficult to boil water or even allow food to simmer without a lid to contain some of that heat. And an essential part of any pot or pan lid is the handle; this is the crucial piece that keeps you from getting burned by the steaming hot surface. So if your pots and pan lids are missing their handles, you’ve just entered some potentially dangerous cooking territory. If your lids are broken like this, you’d have to throw them away, right? Wrong! With this simple DIY, you can not only fix your lids, but you can also give them a stylish upgrade! It’s a completely free project and it will make your pot and pan lids usable once more. You only need three simple materials to get a functional pot or pan lid! Most likely, you have all of them hanging around the house right now. If not, they’re easy to get a hold of and relatively inexpensive (one item comes at a slightly higher cost, but it’s one we think you’ll be willing to pay.) Here’s what you’ll need to get started: Materials Wine cork Screwdriver Screw Washer Instructions Place your cork on one of the empty holes on the top of your lid. Try to center it as best you can. Flip the lid over so it’s balancing on the cork; feel free to grab the lid by the cork to keep pressure on it instead of balancing it. Put your washer around the hole and prep your screw. Take your screw and screwdriver and work the screw into the cork, continuing to apply pressure to the cork. By simply replacing your handle with a regular wine cork, you’ve created a soft, heat-resistant new handle that looks stylish, too! Not only that, but it was most likely free to revive your lid – if you had to buy anything, it was probably a bottle of wine so you could scavenge the cork. We’re willing to bet that you’re not too upset with that investment. This DIY does depend a lot on HOW your lid handle broke. In some circumstances, you may have to remove lingering screws or even pieces of the broken handle from the lid. Naturally, those are steps that would take place before the outlined instructions above. But once all is said and done, you’ll have a new handle that you can easily grab (even when your hands are wet) and won’t burn you! Best of all, the DIY cork handle is also dishwasher-safe, so you don’t have to clean your upgraded lids in some new, bizarre way. Your new cork handle is going to look so great, you might want to replace all your other boring lid handles with this hack! This is also a great way to use up some wine corks if you like to stockpile them like I do. What do you think of this creative DIY? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

Inevitably the axe is bound to fall a few times over the years. But new research has uncovered a more common reason for getting unfriended than both baby pics and pseudo intellectual life-coaching. According to the study, conducted by researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, politics is the ultimate no-go zone when it comes to Facebook, and it is the single most common reason to get you kicked off people’s friends list. The Israeli researchers picked the extremely controversial issue of the Israel-Gaza conflict and found that during a recent surge of violence in 2014, 16 per cent of the participants in their study had unfriended someone based on their political views. quotesgram.com Nicholas John of the university said: People unfriend people who have different political views to theirs. We already know that Facebook and search engines provide us with a feed and search results that are tailored to us. These findings suggest that the people most likely to unfriend are younger, more politically active, more active on Facebook, have lots of Facebook friends, and have more extreme political views — these are important people in online discussions.

Of course, he never thought the sale would actually go through, but to his huge surprise it did. That’s right, in a couple of clicks, and for the princely sum of $12, Sanmay had become the proud owner of the most famous website address in the world. However, it didn’t take Google long (one minute, to be precise) to realize something had gone terribly wrong with its system, prompting it to fire off an email to Sanmay telling him it’d canceled his order and refunded his purchase. After reviewing the error, Google decided to give Sanmay a financial reward for bringing the bug to its attention. Despite people’s curiosity about how much Google paid the guy who momentarily owned its domain name, neither the Web giant nor Sanmay disclosed the sum. Until now, that is. Sanmay, who’s currently an MBA student at Babson College in Boston, said last year the company had offered him \"a $x reward in a very Googley way,\" and now we see what he means. Sort of. In a post on its security blog this week reviewing events from 2015, the Mountain View company revealed it paid Sanmay $6,006.13, the figure supposedly spelling out Google. \"Squint a little and you’ll see it,\" the company says. Of course, for a company that reported profits of $4 billion for its most recent quarter, some will wonder why Google didn’t dig a little deeper into its pockets for an error of this magnitude. However, the money was paid as part of Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program, which offers cash to those spotting bugs lurking within its multitude of systems and tools. The company said in the post that last year it paid out more than $2 million to over 300 bug hunters around the world – equal to about $6,000 per payout, the same as Sanmay received (if you squint a little). Anyway, the MBA student said from the start that holding the Google domain \"was never about money,\" and was perfectly happy with Google’s reward.

              "  'context': 'It’s been less than 4 days since The Voice singer, Christina Grimmie, was shot and killed while signing autographs after her concert in Orlando, Florida. The tragedy has left her loved ones, fans, and fellow musicians not only heartbroken, but also confused. However, when I saw this lost footage of Christina Grimmie singing one of the most beautiful hymns of all time, my hope for humanity was restored. Christina Grimmie was one of the few outspoken Christians in the entertainment industry, and she even wrote in the caption of this video \"JESUS CHRIST IS MY LORD AND SAVIOR and [I’m] not at all ashamed of it.\" The video we found features Grimmie performing \"In Christ Alone,\" a powerful, modern Christian song with lyrics that gave me chills — and left me in tears. She posted the video in celebration of Easter in 2012, which she referred to as her \"favorite holiday.\" \"No guilt in life, no fear in death, This is the power of Christ in me; From life’s first cry to final breath, Jesus commands my destiny. No power of hell, no scheme of man, Can ever pluck me from His hand; Till He returns or calls me home, Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand.\" – \"In Christ Alone\" When I learned the details of Christina Grimmie’s faith in Jesus Christ, I knew she was in a much better place now. Grimmie was close friends with pop-star and Texas native, Selena Gomez, who made headlines after she broke down onstage the day after Grimmie’s life was taken. Gomez’s and Grimmie’s relationship dates back to when both were teenagers, and Gomez’s stepfather, Brian Teefey, became Grimmie’s manager after discovering her on YouTube. Grimmie was also the opening act for Gomez on the North American portion of her 2011 tour. My heart is absolutely broken. I miss you Christina pic.twitter.com/KWGwZZlj4t — Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) June 11, 2016 The pain from the tragic loss of Grimmie became unbearable for Gomez while she performed \"Nobody,\" her song that illustrates common Christian themes like salvation and keeping the faith. \"No oxygen, can barely breathe My darkest sin, you’ve raised release And it’s all because of You, all because of You I don’t know what it is, but you’ve pulled me in No one compares, could ever begin To love me like You do And I wouldn’t want them to\" – \"Nobody\" \"When she was 14, we met her and my parents and I signed her. One thing about Christina and her family is that she holds her faith so closely to her,\" Gomez said. \"She had faith, and I don’t really understand how this really happened, but I would like to dedicate this next song to her.\" That’s when Gomez started to perform \"Transfiguration\" by Hillsong Worship, a powerful Christian song with emotional lyrics. \"The only song my soul can find to sing Is Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah my King Lead my longing heart To the high ground, to the clear view And in awe I’ll be there Beholding You\" – Transfiguration Selena Gomez and Christina Grimmie weren’t just friends, they were sisters in Christ. Although Gomez may not understand God’s plan, she’s finding peace by trusting in it. When I learned the legacy Christina Grimmie left behind, I realized God was using her in extraordinary ways. Although she’s no longer a part of this lifetime, her legacy will continue teaching valuable life lessons for generations to come — and her performance of \"In Christ Alone\" is proof. Here’s 3 Things We Learned From Christina Grimmie: #1: Time is money, spend it wisely... \"Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.\" – Ephesians 5:15-17 Christina Grimmie may have only been 22-years-old when her life was taken, but she accomplished more in that short time than most adults ever will. The New Jersey native was considered a \"digital phenomena,\" with a YouTube following of more than 3 million subscribers worldwide — who she actively shared her faith in Jesus Christ with. In addition to Grimmie’s charming personality, her advanced musicianship is what captivated the entertainment industry. Unlike most YouTube stars, Christina Grimmie re-composed every cover she performed. When she auditioned with a rendition of \"Wrecking Ball\" on Season 6 of The Voice, all four judges turned their chairs around and fought for the chance to work with her. She finished in 3rd place on ‘Team Adam’ and in 2011, she independently released her first EP titled \"Find Me,\" which debuted at number 2 on iTunes, behind Adele’s \"19.\" Christina Grimmie made every second of her life count, and her untimely death illustrates the fragility of life. All we have is time and in an instant — you could be gone too. #2: Share your gift from God with the world... \"As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace.\" – 1 Peter 4:10 Christina Grimmie’s flawless voice was one of the most beautiful gifts we’ve ever seen God bless anyone with – and I’m so thankful she was brave enough to share it with the world at such a young age. Although we all have different gifts, we can all be inspired by Grimmie’s courage to share her gift of music at such a young age. The judges from NBC’s The Voice were vividly touched by Christina Grimmie, and it was her incredible singing that led them to her. Blake Shelton revealed he was \"stunned and disgusted and heartbroken that we lost that sweet little girl.\" Adam Levine made headlines when he offered to pay for her funeral. Levine revealed that he was \"absolutely devastated and heartbroken by Christina Grimmie’s death\" and that \"Christina was a natural, a gifted talent that comes along so rarely. She was taken from us too soon.\" Whether you like it or not, we all have gifts God gave us to serve one another. Christina Grimmie’s passion to share her faith in Jesus Christ through her impressive talent is a perfect example of sharing our gifts as devout stewards of God’s diverse grace. #3: Death is nothing to fear... \"A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth.\" – Ecclesiastes 7:1 Christina Grimmie’s performance of \"In Christ Alone\" and the powerful lyrics to this hymn reveal the beauty of trusting in God’s plan. It’s impossible to pick a favorite part from this video, but it’s possible to use an entire box of tissues while watching it. \"What heights of love, what depths of peace, when fears are stilled, when strivings cease! My Comforter, my All in All, here in the love of Christ I stand.\" – \"In Christ Alone\" After The Loss Of Christina Grimmie, We Learn There’s More To Her Life Than Meets The Eye',\n",

You remember the initial hubbub: North Carolina and the federal government suing each other, the boycotts and the hashtags and the Bruce Springsteen concerts cancelled. In spite of that, North Carolina’s government hasn’t repealed the law, and this week, the state lost high-profile sporting events, too, as the ACC and the NCAA pulled their championship games out of the state in protest. (If the NCAA is looking at you sideways, you know you’re doing something shady.) But we’re not here to talk about how the bill is bad and discriminatory. The DOJ made that call months ago.

North Carolina’s Republican leadership racked up at least $176,000 in legal fees so far, $47,000 of which is just lawyers for the beleaguered Governor Pat McCrory. Why do those numbers matter? They are paid with tax dollars, and they’re rising. In June, the North Carolina legislature approved diverting $500,000 from the disaster relief fund to Governor McCrory’s offices for HB2 litigation. Sure, this HB2 situation’s a disaster. But in a state that sees two, three hurricanes per year ... they might have done other things with that money—especially as hurricane season gets underway. So it costs taxpayers money to fight lawsuits. How much does it cost them that businesses now see North Carolina as a bad investment? According to the think tank Center for American Progress, business boycotts and pullouts have cost North Carolina another $87.7 million. Charlotte has recently been a popular filming location, so when Lionsgate puts the kibosh on filming in North Carolina after HB2, just that led to three million dollars down the drain. North Carolinians lost $58.3 million when PayPal and an \"unnamed tech company\" canceled their planned expansions to the state. North Carolina has been vying the past few years for attention as the Silicon Valley of the South, but the loss of those jobs—and the anti-HB2 amicus brief signed by 68 companies, including notable tech giants like Apple, Dropbox, Salesforce, Slack, SV Angel, Yelp, and Zynga— have put a damper on that campaign. \"There’s a clear drumbeat here, and a bit of a snowball effect,\" says Laura Durso, senior director of the LGBT Research and Communications Project at the Center for American Progress. \"More and more companies are taking a look at their own values, and living those out.\" But by far the sector of North Carolina’s economy most strapped by HB2 backlash is tourism. Leaving aside sports for a second, by the figuring of Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority, the Greater Raleigh Convention and Visitors Bureau, and the Greensboro Convention and Visitors Bureau, the state’s three largest cities lost $109.4 million to canceled conferences and other events since HB2. That’s things like the Bruce Springsteen concert, which probably contributed about $700,000 to that loss alone. But now we get to where it really hurts North Carolina most: sports. And here we’re talking the total economic impact as opposed to direct spending. That includes the ticket sales and hotel rooms, but also the cost to the florist down the street who would have done arrangements for a post-game reception. When the NBA pulled their All-Star Game, North Carolina missed out on $106 million. When the NCAA and ACC followed suit with their championship games, it means a loss of at least another $91.4, $51 million from the NCAA events and $40.4 million from the ACC’s. While it might sound frivolous in comparison to losing, say, 400 highly skilled PayPal jobs with an estimated total salary of $20 million, college basketball abandoning North Carolina is hitting the state in its heart. \"It obviously a loss for our grand basketball tradition,\" says Chris Sgro, executive director of LGBTQ rights organization Equality North Carolina and a member of the state’s General Assembly. \"In many of our cities, we’ll have a sporting event drought for years to come if we don’t repeal HB2.\" As one North Carolinian put it: \"college sports is religion in North Carolina.\" And for now it’s gone. The Grand Total Adding all that up, the total cost to North Carolinians so far from HB2 protests is slightly more than $395 million. That’s more than the GDP of Micronesia. And the bulk of it is from sporting organizations, who even five years ago would likely not have waded into political territory like this. But experts aren’t that surprised that the NBA, NCAA, and ACC have taken this step now. \"They’re not out on a limb here,\" Durso says. \"They’re in line with their base.\" The near unanimous outcry against HB2 and in support of the NCAA and ACC confirms that. Legislating discrimination has become an expensive bad habit. Guess How Much That Anti-LGBTQ Law Is Costing North Carolina',\n",

Syracuse, New York, climbed to third place on this year’s list after ranking 20th in 2015. Providence, Rhode Island, and Buffalo, New York, also make appearances in this year’s top 10. \"We were surprised by Syracuse and Buffalo jumping into the top 10,\" Burgess said. \"Spring pollen levels in both cities were much higher than those recorded in other major U.S. metropolitan areas, but Buffalo experienced a significant reduction in the number of certified allergists compared to last year, which may have influenced lower than expected medication utilization. (MORE: The Surprising Way You Can Prevent Allergies Before They Start) Although there has been a trend over the last few decades of the spring allergy season inching up on the calendar, Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York and an ambassador for AAFA, told weather.com that the presence of El Niño this winter and the wet, mild winter weather much of the country saw can result in a stronger allergy season. \"In any year with an El Niño phenomenon, we expect certain areas of the country, particularly in the South, to be plagued by lots of rainfall and precipitation,\" Dr. Clifford Bassett said. \"Each year it’s different. If you look at the aerobiology, you have a lot of different pollen areas. There’s a lot of cities [in the South] that are hit hard each year during the spring allergy season.\" And Burgess agrees. \"Certain parts of the country appear to be experiencing higher than average pollen counts while others have shown lower counts,\" which could be thanks to the presence of El Niño, he said. \"Generally speaking, the United States has experienced a warmer than typical winter coupled with late winter precipitation that has created an earlier pollen season than typically seen. Pollen counts are on the rise around the country and individuals who experience seasonal allergies need to be proactive and meet with their allergists to prepare a plan to address their symptoms.\" The AFAA compiles the annual city rankings using data on metro-area pollen counts, the availability of board-certified allergists in the region and rates of allergy medication use.

              "  'context': 'If the twists and turns of the 2016 election have you longing for a time when you could turn on your TV to see high-minded political debate, you might be thrilled to learn that the cast of \"The West Wing\" recently reunited! The political drama ran on NBC from 1999 to 2006, and took audiences into the offices of White House staffers working for the fictitious Josiah Bartlet administration. Over the course of its run, the show won legions of die-hard fans, not to mention four consecutive Emmy awards for outstanding drama series. The show\\'s stars — Bradley Whitford (\"Josh Lyman\"), Richard Schiff (\"Toby Ziegler\"), Dulé Hill (\"Charlie Young\"), Joshua Malina (\"Will Bailey\"), Janel Maloney (\"Donna Moss\"), Melissa Fitzgerald (\"Carol Fitzpatrick\"), along with creator and executive producer Aaron Sorkin — recently sat down with TODAY at the ATX Television Festival in Austin, Texas. Cast members Martin Sheen, Allison Janney and Rob Lowe were unable to attend. Here are 7 things we learned from these White House \"staffers\": 1. Shows about politics can work While a drama set in the halls of the White House might seem commonplace these days (\"Scandal,\" \"House of Cards\" and \"Veep\"), \"The West Wing\" was a trendsetter. When the show debuted in 1999, Whitford acknowledges that \"it was very in the air that political shows don\\'t work.\" \"The West Wing\" would go on to prove otherwise, for seven seasons. NBC The cast of \"The West Wing,\" pictured left to right: Richard Schiff as Toby Ziegler, Dule Hill as Charlie Young, Allison Janney as Claudia Jean \\'C.J.\\' Cregg, John Spencer as Leo McGarry, Martin Sheen as President Josiah \\'Jed\\' Bartlet, Rob Lowe as Sam Seaborn, Janel Moloney as Donna Moss, Bradley Whitford as Josh Lyman. 2. Who would President Bartlet endorse this year? Donald Trump? Hillary Clinton? Bernie Sanders? Who would President Bartlet endorse in the wild and crazy world of the 2016 presidential election? While Bartlet portrayer Martin Sheen was unable to make it to the reunion, the cast shared their opinions on the 2016 political race. Assessing the match-up, Sorkin alluded to his own concerns about Donald Trump and declared that, if he were a real person, President Bartlet \"would endorse Hillary Clinton.\" Who would President Bartlet endorse in 2016 race? Aaron Sorkin weighs in:https://t.co/0rZsutlgEv — TODAY (@TODAYshow) June 22, 2016 3. The best way to get cast on \\'The West Wing\\'? Save the executive producer\\'s life Actor Joshua Malina joined the program in season four as speechwriter Will Bailey. But his connection to Aaron Sorkin goes back a few decades, when Malina appeared in the Broadway production of Sorkin\\'s \"A Few Good Men.\" One fateful night, Malina and Sorkin were bowling with the cast when Sorkin choked on a hamburger. Malina sprung to action, giving him the Heimlich. Sorkin acknowledges that Malina \"really did save my life,\" and perhaps not coincidentally, Malina went to appear in almost everything Sorkin has ever written (\"A Few Good Men,\" \"The American President\" and \"Sports Night\"). 4. Josh and Donna should have gotten together a lot sooner The relationship between Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Whitford) and his assistant Donna Moss (Moloney) may have been one of the slowest-burning romances in TV history. The two flirted for years, before finally locking lips in season seven. What took so long? Moloney reveals she never wanted the two to get together for fears that once the sexual tension was broken, her character would be phased out. Sorkin takes the blame in this instance, citing his own concerns that nothing interesting would happen if the two got together. The executive producer told TODAY that if he had to do it over again, he would\\'ve \"let them have a relationship.\" 5. The Broadway phenomenon \\'Hamilton\\' owes a debt to \\'The West Wing\\' Who is the biggest \"West Wing\" fan of all? According to the cast, it\\'s none other than \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. The cast revealed that when they went backstage at the Tony Award-winning show, Miranda mentioned how the program inspired \"Hamilton.\" Miranda and his fellow \"Hamilton\" castmates even showed their love for the TV drama with a \"West Wing\"-inspired walk and talk when they paid a visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue earlier this year. 6. Aaron Sorkin has never seen the later seasons of \\'The West Wing\\' Aaron Sorkin created the program but left after season four to pursue other opportunities. The show soldiered on in Sorkin\\'s absence for 3 more years, with new characters, dramatic plot lines, and a presidential election. But what did Sorkin think of the show\\'s later seasons? The truth is, he never even watched. \"Seinfeld\" co-creator Larry David (who left his own show midway through its run) advised him: \"You can\\'t ever watch the show again — because you\\'re gonna watch it and either it\\'s going to be great and you\\'re gonna be miserable, or it\\'s gonna be less than great and you\\'re gonna be miserable. But either way, you\\'re gonna be miserable.\" Sorkin took David\\'s advice and admits that watching those later seasons would have felt like \"watching somebody make out with my wife.\" 7. \\'West Wing\\' reboot? Maybe... With so many reunions and reboots these days (Thanks, Netflix!), it seems like no television show ever really has to say goodbye. So is the cast ready to bring those iconic \"walk and talks\" back to TV? The group we spoke with say they\\'d be up for it, and Sorkin confesses \"if there was a way to bring it back without harming its legacy, I would.\" The response from \"West Wing\" fans?

Their geotargeting is poorly calibrated. Worse, the messages are limited to 90 plain-text characters only; no photos, no hyperlinks. But the inadequacies of the WEA system aren’t necessarily a bad thing: The government should probably not have a direct vector through which it can blast citizens with rich text and mugshots. And, frankly, if the people in charge of sending out alerts can’t see that drafting an entire city into a national-security operation on the basis of a single name is a terrible idea, there’s no reason to think that giving them more tools will fix the problem.

Best of all, we've included expert curated playlist for every activity, giving you the boost to handle the chores and your guests the backdrop for a great day. Let's get started. Two Days Before Start eating everything in your fridge so you have room for food and alcohol to chill before your party. Decide on seating. For most parties, it’s fine to leave a few guests standing, but your guests will each need a place to park while their eyes are glued to the game. Make sure your TV gets the Super Bowl. Don’t laugh! Many Super Bowl parties have been ruined because the cable was out or the bunny ears weren’t working. This year the Super Bowl airs on Fox in the US and CTV in Canada. You can also livestream the game from Fox Sports or CTV. Get inspired for your party with our Stadium Rock Anthems playlist. The Day Before Purchase all food, disposable plates, and silverware. Pick up some beer and alcohol, and clean your house! Our ‘90s Chore-list Rump Shakers playlist is a great soundtrack for tidying up. Five Hours Before Make sure the beer (or wine) is cold. Hopefully you’ve got some fridge space, but if not, a bit of snow by the front porch or on the fire escape will work nicely. Finish cooking the food. And listen to our Indie in the Kitchen playlist while you do it. As Guests Arrive Hopefully by now you've set up any stations like a baked potato/hot dog/nacho bar, or a real bar, so your guests can start serving themselves as they arrive. Put on the perfect gridiron pump-up playlist and make your guests feel like they’re at the game... only with warmer seats and better nachos. Our Gridiron Glory playlist is the perfect choice, obviously. After The Game Maybe you’ll be celebrating your team’s win. Or maybe you’ll be rehashing your team’s whole losing strategy.

This expert tip comes from Chef Pati Jinich, host of This expert tip comes from Chef Pati Jinich, host of Pati’s Mexican Table on PBS and spokesperson for Avocados From Mexico , who says the most common mistake people make when preparing guacamole is failing to plan ahead. \"The most important thing to getting your guacamole right is getting the right avocado,\" she says. \"Don’t leave that for the last minute.

Jinich suggests Once you have a perfectly ripe avocado, the rest of the recipe is much more forgiving. Jinich suggests starting with the classic ingredients , then offering guests the option of adding their own toppings. Her go-to recipe starts with two to three ripe avocados, a generous amount of sea salt or Kosher salt, and one to two tablespoons of freshly-squeezed lime juice. To that, she adds chopped cilantro , a little bit of white onion or scallion , and a fresh chopped jalapeno or Serrano chili. Stir to combine. \"You can serve that classic, and you can top it with pomegranate seeds,\" she says. \"You can grab another bowl, and top it with queso fresco or Feta cheese. Or you can grab another bowl and add some fresh tomatoes.\" Other crowd-pleasing options? Seared chilies marinated with soy sauce and lime juice, fried chunks of Mexican chorizo, crunchy Japanese-style peanuts, and freshly diced pineapple. For a classy spin, she suggests adding crab meat and seasoning with olive oil. Give some TLC to the chips, too.

The after-credits scene has gone from an occasional surprise for dedicated moviegoers to something of an expectation within certain genres. This scene — sometimes called a stinger — is one that comes after all the credits have ended and most viewers have left the theater to throw away their empty popcorn bags and head to the car. The post-credits scene is a staple of the superhero genre, with the Marvel movies containing not one but two scenes that play before the credits have ended. Comedies, like Sausage Party, are more of a mixed bag and aren’t as reliable for including a post-credits scene. So, does Sausage Party have a post-credits scene? According to the site AfterCredits.com, the answer is no. There is no extra scene either during or after the credits. At first, even critics weren’t sure if the movie would have an extra scene. A rough cut of the movie that showed for critics at the South by Southwest festival earlier this year didn’t have any credits at all, Variety noted. But for a historical reference, Seth Rogen also didn’t include an after-credits scene in his previous movies, including This Is the End or Superbad. Sausage Party review – Seth Rogen\\'s surprisingly tasty supermarket sweep https://t.co/VRbOB0nf2o — The Guardian (@guardian) August 10, 2016 There are some surprises during the credits themselves, Slash Film noted. The movie has a number of surprising stars voicing the talking food, with their credits saved until after the movie has ended. The rest of the cast includes Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Michael Cera, James Franco, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton and Salma Hayek. Most of them are playing food, but a couple of them are playing humans. We won’t tell you which ones are playing humans though, because there are several voices you likely won’t recognize as belonging to some of these stars until you see the end credits. But those who do go to see Sausage Party may be caught by surprise by its contents. The raunchiness is a bit out of place in an animated movie, but not at all unexpected in a movie from Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and Jonah Hill and certainly not a first for a genre that includes movies like South Park: Bigger, Longer, And Uncut. #SausageParty might not be an Oscar wiener... but it\\'s wurst a trip to the theatre! Review: https://t.co/FsthoAhuyi pic.twitter.com/jp6xTswcjA — IGN (@IGN) August 11, 2016 No, the surprise instead comes in its message about the nature of religion. The movie starts with the foods all living together in the grocery store, hoping to be selected by \"the gods,\" which happen to be consumers. As a review in Christianity Today (yes, Christianity Today did review the R-rated Sausage Party), the movie shows quite a bit of depth from there and a deep message about atheism and its role in society. \"If the movie stopped there, it would have been irritatingly dogmatic in the vein of The Invention of Lying, Ricky Gervais’s humorless anti-religious screed. And certainly Sausage Party suggests an anti-theistic worldview is the most enlightened one. But as the story goes on, Frank (the hero and the lead atheist in the bunch) learns that just because you are pretty sure you’ve apprehended the truth doesn’t give you license to cram that down the throats of those who believe (he puts it in much cruder terms). Sausage Party gives a full-throated defense of tolerance and a condemnation of ethnic and religious feuding, underlined by a subplot involving a pita and a bagel.\" There is at least one advantage to there being no after-credits scene in Sausage Party — viewers can feel safe in getting a head start out the door, unless they’re very interested in seeing who served as the third assistant editor. ‘Sausage Party’ Post-Credits Scene: Did Seth Rogen Hide A Scene After The Credits In The R-Rated Animated Comedy?',\n",

Saw and his sister Steela, were two of the main characters of the first arc of Season 5. Over four episodes, we saw these two enlist the help of the Jedi -- specifically Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano -- to free their planet from the Separatists. Many may remember the episodes solely because of the love triangle between Steela, Lux Bonteri, and Ahsoka. However, Saw made an impression on viewers because of his persistence and drive. Saw Gerrera made an impression on Clone Wars viewers because of his persistence and drive. Share on Facebook Share to Twitter My main memory of Saw isn't necessarily a good one. During the third episode of the arc, the reigning king of Saw's home planet, Onderon, plans to kill his predecessor whom he usurped for control of the planet. Steela proposes a reasonable plan to free the prior king at his execution but Saw doesn't agree. He believes they need to infiltrate the prison and break the ex-king free. The entire team disagrees. Saw doesn't care and heads out to the prison. Unbeknownst to Saw, he's entered the trap he feared would be set during the execution. He becomes a prisoner and is tortured in an attempt to learn where his comrades are hiding. He withholds the information and insults Onderon's general, telling him it's his fault that the Separatists have taken the planet. Saw is then taken to view the execution. At the execution, the rebels intend to free Saw and the ex-king but are thwarted by the Separatists. Ahsoka begins to press forward and seems to be preparing to strike, however, the general beats her to the punch. He frees Saw and the ex-king and they all flee to the mountains. Image Credits: Lucasfilm What This Means for Saw Gerrera in Rogue One Saw was willing to risk everything he and his team had fought for to free the imprisoned king. Though he cares for his friends and family, his rebellious attitude is strong enough to outweigh his sentimentality. This makes him dangerously impulsive. Saw also believed his plan was the correct one despite the view of everyone else. His pride moved him to follow his own path instead of trusting his allies. Because of his inability to give in and show humility, he was imprisoned and nearly executed. He's very clearly rebellious; when Saw wanted his planet freed, he got up and made it happen. He was ready to fight whoever -- and whatever -- got in his way. Saw's rebellious attitude is part of what kept his friends going in the darkest of times. He kept the embers of discontent burning within them. In Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Saw Gerrera inspires loyalty. Share on Facebook Share to Twitter Lastly, he inspires loyalty. Saw helped convince the Jedi to help the rebels. He even convinced the general to take his men and turn against the crown. Saw is able to help people overcome their fear of others. He made the perfect rebel leader because of his ability to draw people into the cause. Because of all of this, Saw is the perfect character to feature in Rogue One. Like Jyn Erso says in the trailer, he too rebels. He will most likely be a Hulk-like character; not in strength but in purpose. The Rebellion's leaders will have to decide if unleashing the hero is worth bringing forth the consequences. Considering how the Onderon arc ends in The Clone Wars, Saw may be entirely reckless and constantly looking for vengeance and fights when we catch up with him 25 years later in Rogue One. On the other hand, the consequences of the rebellion on Onderon may have made him wary of fighting and rebelling altogether. Saw and Steela. Image Credit: Lucasfilm I can't truthfully say what Saw will be like in Rogue One. We do know his past though, and we know what he's been through. Hopefully Rogue One will address what happened to Saw all of those years ago and the toll it took on him. Either way, we're all happy to have Saw back in the Star Wars Universe.

              "  'context': 'Karl Pillemer, a Ph.D. gerontologist at Cornell University, has spent the last several years interviewing hundreds of older Americans to systematically collect their practical wisdom. His first book, 30 Lessons for Living, synthesized advice from over 1,000 elders on topics like happiness, work, and health. In January, Pillemer followed up with 30 Lessons for Loving, which features lessons from over 700 older Americans with 25,000 collective years of marriage experience. One couple he profiles was married for 76 years. Another interviewee describes divorcing her husband, then remarrying him 64 years later. Among other questions, he asked these oldest Americans what people tend to regret at their age, and what they would advise younger people to do to avoid regrets. One message was expressed in different forms but repeated again and again, with great emphasis: In an interview with The Huffington Post, Pillemer expressed surprise at how many elders said that their greatest regret was not traveling enough. Many believed it wasn\\'t worth the costs; others put it off after having children; and still others decided to wait until retirement. An 81-year-old named Jack, whose wife Lynne died of cancer after they retired, shared his heart-breaking experience of realizing he had waited too long. \"We always thought we\\'d do a lot of traveling when we retired, you know? But then Lynne passed away, and it was too late. I went on a couple of trips and I guess they were okay, but it\\'s less fun going alone. I took a bus through the Canadian Rockies, and I actually turned once to talk to her -- I was sitting in a seat by myself and it was beautiful, and I wanted to tell Lynne, \\'Look at that light, the color, that light.\\' But of course she wasn\\'t there. And I just want to share things with her when I travel, but we waited too long.\" Pillemer, summarizing the collective advice of these elders, said, \"Travel is so rewarding that it should take precedence over other things younger people spend money on.\" Travel is especially valuable to people in the early stages of a relationship, Pillemer noted. \"That period when you are meeting people from all over the world and thrown onto your own resources, detached from family and other pressures -- it\\'s a truly life-changing experience,\" he said, referencing his own travel in Germany after college with his spouse-to-be. \"To go through that with someone, where you\\'re dealing with those kinds of challenges together, it\\'s sort of a signature way to start a relationship and really be reliant on one another.\" He continued: \"That\\'s one thing that the elders would recommend: travel\\'s great at any age, but particularly important when you\\'re young, and if it can be part of a relationship that you\\'re building, it\\'s an experience not to be missed.\" Here\\'s How To Avoid One Of The Most Common Life Regrets',\n",

              "  'context': 'A bill that would provide order to California\\'s muddled medical marijuana program cleared a major hurdle Friday, when the state Assembly\\'s Appropriations Committee moved it forward for a full Assembly vote next week. Authored by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano (D-San Francisco), the measure, AB 1894, would create uniform rules to govern the state\\'s multibillion-dollar medical marijuana industry. Although California became the first state to legalize cannabis for medicinal use in 1996, the state has yet to establish a set of standards guiding the cultivation, production and sale of the plant, which has led to what Ammiano described to The Huffington Post as \"chaos.\" \"I am optimistic that we can continue to work with all parties to finally create regulation that will satisfy all needs,\" Ammiano said in a statement Friday, \"from federal law enforcement down to the very sick patients who depend on the health benefits only marijuana can provide.\" California currently leaves it up to local governments to decide how they want to implement the state\\'s medical marijuana law. As a result, some cities, like San Francisco and Oakland, have established clear-cut systems that dictate where dispensaries can operate and impose fees that directly enrich their coffers. Other places, like San Diego and San Jose, remain largely unregulated, with very little control over where pot-related businesses can operate. San Jose lawmakers are currently mulling legislation that would effectively make it impossible for medical marijuana providers to exist. \"Marijuana has never been regulated by the state as any other business,\" Ammiano told HuffPost last year after introducing similar legislation. \"Cities and counties don\\'t know what to do or what they can do. Police are unsure how to respond.\" AB 1894 would create a division within California\\'s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to regulate all medical marijuana-related entities throughout the state, from the farmers that cultivate the plant to the storefronts that sell it. The proposal would allow the agency to impose fees on marijuana businesses in order to raise revenue for the state, and local municipalities would also be allowed to impose additional taxes. \"Without regulation, there\\'s no way to capture any of the income that could go toward our infrastructure or other worthy causes,\" Ammiano told HuffPost last month. California\\'s lack of statewide regulations over its pot program has left it vulnerable to federal interference, as the drug is still classified as a Schedule 1 substance (along with heroin and LSD) in the eyes of the national government. In 2011, a coalition of U.S. attorneys launched an aggressive crackdown on medical marijuana operations throughout the state under the guise that the industry had spiraled out of control. Since then, hundreds of businesses related to the drug have closed, and thousands of people have lost their jobs. Last month, the Drug Enforcement Administration raided several dispensaries in Los Angeles, and a pot shop in Mendocino, closed by federal authorities earlier this year, only recently reopened. By contrast, the Obama administration has been less combative in states with more comprehensive regulations. Colorado, for example, has faced fewer DEA raids and has been allowed to implement its groundbreaking recreational, adult-use law largely in peace. Late last year, Attorney General Eric Holder indicated that the federal government would not intervene in states that had \"strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems.\" \"While statewide regulations won\\'t change federal law, it does seem to be the case that states that have uniform, clear regulations are less likely to be interfered with by the feds,\" Tom Angell, the head of weed advocacy group Marijuana Majority, told HuffPost last mont. \"It\\'s very confusing in California right now: a patchwork of regulations city to city and county to county.\" Ammiano has made many attempts to create statewide medical marijuana regulations over the past few years, but each piece of legislation stalled or was defeated by opponents who argued the measures didn\\'t address key issues like the environmental implications of growing cannabis or the criteria for doctors to make recommendations to patients. He\\'s confident his current bill addresses every concern and more. \"I\\'m cautiously optimistic,\" he told HuffPost last month. \"People have seen that the more regulation you have, the less chaos you have.\" Meanwhile, marijuana reform advocates believe a measure like Ammiano\\'s is the key to paving the way for a law that would allow recreational use by adults in the state. Recent polls have suggested a majority of Californians support legalizing pot for recreational purposes, and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has joined an effort to place a legalization initiative on the 2016 ballot. But first, \"we need to show that California has the ability to regulate marijuana,\" Angell said. \"This would help further demonstrate how tax revenue can be generated and put into needed programs.\" California Moves One Step Closer To Ending Medical Marijuana \\'Chaos\\'',\n",

For starters, the Legendary bird that represents Team Instinct, Zapdos, appears to have the lowest damage per second (DPS) out of the three birds in Pokémon GO. Articuno, Legendary bird for Team Mystic, leads the trio with 14.8 DPS, followed by Moltres and Zapdos fighting at 9.52 and 8.33 DPS, respectively. Secondly, Team Instinct has steadily been at the bottom of nearly every poll and survey regarding which team players have been choosing. The less players a team has in a city, the harder it is to maintain control of gyms. Third, when you gather enough candy to evolve an Eevee, receiving a Jolteon as opposed to a Vaporeon or Flareon can be a little disappointing. Vaporeons are significantly stronger since they receive the most CP per power up out of the three Eeveelutions (+40 for Vaporeon, +39 for Flareon, and +31 for Jolteon). Their attacks provide more DPS than the other two, especially since their attacks are much quicker. Team Instinct may have more of a challenge ahead of them in Pokémon GO, but that shouldn’t necessarily deter anyone from joining the team. They do have some badass electric type Pokémon supporting them, they carry around a sense of determination, and they don’t necessarily consider everything to be a dick measuring contest, which provides a sense of humility.

              "  'context': 'Hundreds of people are packed into a bumping basement club in downtown Berlin, dancing for hours on end in a free-wheeling rave. The substance of choice hails from the exotic tropics. It’s said to impart a brain-boosting rush and tons of energy, enough to transform its users into raging Energizer bunnies. This drug can be ingested, drunk and even snorted. You’re probably familiar with its common name: cacao. Say, um, \"hi\" to the sweetest party drug there is. In recent months, cacao has transcended its already lofty status as a superfood and vaulted into the realm of party drugs. In this latest incarnation, cacao powder is taking the place of alcohol and illicit substances like Molly and ecstasy in parts of Western Europe. Lucid, a monthly cacao-fueled dance party in Berlin, fixes bitter Balinese cacao into partygoers’ drinks. Morning Gloryville, a rise-and-shine rave company that organizes dance parties from London to New York, stocks its bar with cacao drinks and cacao pills. And in perhaps the strangest form, Belgian chocolatier Dominique Persoone invented a special $50 snorting device so you can huff your chocolate in powdered form, much like cocaine. Never mind that this is the same raw powder you can find at the corner Vitamin Shoppe or processed in your favorite candy bar — or that cacao is perfectly legal in all the jurisdictions we found. Proponents say that raw, virgin cacao is far more potent than you ever imagined. First comes a surge of endorphins into your bloodstream, which increases acuity and fuels you with feelings of euphoria. Then there’s the flood of magnesium, which relaxes your muscles and de-tenses your body. Raw cacao is also chock-full of flavanols that increase blood circulation and stimulate brain power, according to a recent study from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. And, of course, cacao can be downright delicious. Lucid’s pixie-like party organizer, Ruby May, isn’t a purist when it comes to the stuff: She spikes the 18 pounds of cacao per party with sweet hints of honey, agave syrup and cinnamon, and the celebrations go on for six hours. \"It’s like a smooth, sensual hug in a cup,\" says the 36-year old. And as far as the sniffing chocolate goes, Persoone mixes the powder with ginger, raspberry and mint for his patrons in Belgium. Chili pepper was tried, he says, but was \"not a good idea.\" Color us surprised. To be clear, cacao is not going to distort your reality. Under the beats of house, hip-hop, funk and electronic music, cacao \"amplifies\" the experience, rather than dims it with alcohol or drugs, says May. In fact, she doesn’t allow booze inside. The mood-boosting effects of cacao are \"subtle,\" she says, and it’s not like tripping on acid. Even pure cacao is not actually a drug. While it does contain certain mood-enhancing compounds such as anandamide and phenylethylamine, the bitter reality is that the amount is much too low to have any direct influence on mood, says Dr. Catherine Kwik-Uribe, the director of research and development for Mars Symbioscience, a scientific division of Mars, Incorporated. Which is to say that all of this alleged chocoholism is probably a placebo effect. If it sounds like G-rated fun, well, it is; these are parties where virtue handily wins over vice. All of these concoctions come courtesy of the \"conscious dance movement,\" which evolved from an underground movement into morning raves and lunchtime dance parties, often attended by millennial office workers. It seeks to create a positive — and healthy — environment, in which participants can unhinge themselves from negative thoughts and social inhibitions. Alcohol is usually a no-no, as are illegal drugs. Self-actualization, communal bonding and calorie-burning are key. If it sounds like G-rated fun, well, it is; these are parties where virtue handily wins over vice. (Indeed, a kindergartner’s birthday party, with ice cream and cake, hits more deadly sins than this.) But such events have found an audience. One of Lucid’s attendees was 51-year-old Réka Komáromi, an ethnobotanist based in Canterbury. She says the raves help her to overcome the sorrow of her daughter’s untimely cancer — to \"get rid of the sadness\" and \"allow me to access my anger.\" Now that she’s fully steeped into this scene, she can’t get enough of cacao or its mellowing effects, especially for such \"psychologically hard\" times in her life. The use of cacao was pioneered in millennia past by Mesoamerican civilizations. As early as 1900 B.C., archaeologists believe, the Mokaya people in what is now Mexico were fermenting cacao beans into liquid chocolate. The Aztecs, it seems, valued cacao so highly they would trade the beans as a form of currency. Today, the very ethically conscious may have a beef with chocolate, protesting that appropriating cacao from its Mexican origins for Eurotrash-like dance parties rings a wee bit colonial. Skepticism aside, cacao can act as a \"catalyst for having more life,\" says May, rather than \"numbing ourselves with beer.\" And \"in all my years in research, I have never seen a person not smile when enjoying a piece of chocolate,\" adds Kwik-Uribe. Admittedly, she has a vested interest — but on the other hand, we can’t imagine a party that can’t be improved by chocolate. The Party Drug That Will Give You a Sweet High',\n",

              "  'context': 'It was eye-opening when we learned that artichokes are actually flowers . And that capers are pickled flower buds . But coming across what figs really are ― and the wasp that makes them possible ― has just made us question every truth we know in this world. Because fig flowers bloom internally, they need a special process for pollination. They cannot rely on the wind or bees to spread their pollen ― that’s where the fig wasp comes in. The fig cannot survive without the fig wasp to spread its genetic material, and the fig wasp cannot live without the fig, because that’s where it lays its larva ― this relationship is known as mutualism. In simple terms, figs are technically not a fruit ― they are inverted flowers. Fig trees don’t flower like apples and peaches. Their flowers bloominsidethe pear-shaped pod, which later matures into the fruit we eat. Each flower then produces a single, one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit calledachene― that’s what gives the fig the crunch we know ― and the fig is made up of multiple achene. So when we eat a fig we are actually eating multiple fruits The female fig wasp enters the male fig ― we don’t eat the male figs, by the way ― to lay its eggs. The male fig is shaped in a way to accommodate the laying of wasp eggs. The female wasp’s wings and antennae break off when entering the small passage in the fig so once it’s in, there is no way out. It’s up to the baby wasps to continue the life cycle. Male baby wasps are born without wings, because their sole purpose is to mate with the female offspring ― technically their sister ― and dig a tunnel out of the fig. It’s the female offspring that make the journey out, bringing pollen with them. If a fig wasp enters a female fig accidentally ― the ones we eat ― instead of a male one, there is no room in the interior for it to reproduce. And it cannot escape, because its wings and antennae have broken off. So the wasp dies inside, which is unfortunate but necessary because that’s how it delivers the pollen giving us the fruit we love. Don’t worry, this doesn’t mean the crunch in the fig is a wasp carcass. The fig uses an enzyme known as ficin to break down the wasp into protein, though it doesn’t always break down the entire exoskeleton. So, yes, technically when you bite into a fig you are in fact eating fig wasps ― or what once was a fig wasp ― but you can at least console yourself with the fact that they’re incredibly small.

According to reports, Khloé’s main reason for wanting the divorce to go through is her intent to start her own family. Our sources say Khloe sat Lamar down recently and explained she wanted a family, and couldn’t even start the process of looking until she was single again. We’re told Khloe made it clear to Lamar from the time he almost died last year ... she was dropping the divorce because she wanted to help him get better. She vowed not to re-file until he was able to run his own life day-to-day, and she believes he’s at that point right now. (TMZ) ADVERTI2EMENT Earlier this week, KK shouted out her sister Kim Kardashian and brother-in-law Kanye West‘s two-year wedding anniversary. In April, Lamar updated fans on his relationship status with Khloé. \"We did talk, you know, everything is [up for] discussion,\" Odom said of his ex. \"We talk about anything. We’ve been through a lot. It won’t ever stop.\" But these days, Odom has more than his personal life on his mind. He told ET that his next step is to \"get back on the court.\" \"I still got it,\" he said.

The Belgian\\'s poor form was one of Chelsea\\'s biggest problems last season as they stumbled to a lacklustre 10th-placed finish. Fast forward a few months and the 25-year-old is helping them challenge for the title again. Something clearly went badly wrong under Jose Mourinho. Hazard picked up a little after Christmas once the Special One had been fired, but he still never looked close to the player that won PFA Player of the Year two years ago. Under Conte, though he\\'s now scored three goals in as many games, compared to the four he managed in the whole of last season. It goes without saying that the new manager\\'s arrival has done him the world of good, but the humble Italian believes there\\'s a bit more to it than that. When asked about the reasons for Hazard\\'s revival, Conte told reporters, via Goal.com: \"I think that Eden is playing now more close to the goal. \"He\\'s participating more in offensive situations.

OK, so Hazard isn\\'t quite in that league yet, but many are already suggesting he could be one day if he continues getting better and better. \"Who knows?

I think he must continue to work and to improve his talent, but in this moment he\\'s putting his talent, putting himself, in the team. \"I know Eden is a player with a great talent. A great player.

Yesterday, a Redditor posted code data from Pokemon Go on the subreddit /r/pokemongodev that revealed some new information about the Legendary Pokemon Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres and Mewtwo. So how do you catch Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Go? Here\\'s what we know. Based on the information, the four will not appear in the wild. All of their data is missing a \"Base Capture Rate\", which indicates that they can\\'t be caught in the wild. That\\'s a pretty good indicator that all four Pokemon (plus Mew) are being reserved for special events or prizes of some kind. So if you can\\'t catch Mewtwo and the other Legendary Pokemon in the wild, how do you get them? Well, the popular theory is that they\\'re being saved for \"raids\", a timed event in which players team up to take down a particularly strong Pokemon. We saw a glimpse of that in the first trailer for Pokemon Go, but Niantic has been tight-lipped on the subject since. Some players are also speculating that the Legendaries could be reserved as some sort of reward for holding a gym or being a top ranked player on your team. Of course, Pokemon Go doesn\\'t currently have a ranking system or way to track how long you\\'ve held a gym, so those theories seem more like fanciful speculation than hard fact.

Facebook says it is going to start weeding out \"click bait,\" which it’s defining as a post with \"a headline that encourages people to see more, without telling them much information about what they will see.\" You’ve seen a million of these — they’re so common on the Web that they have their own parodies. Just in case you’re unclear, Facebook illustrates this concept with a (presumably) fake post about a celebrity tiff: So why has Facebook decided, in 2014, that it doesn’t like this stuff, since Facebook users seem to like it? The company’s explanation is that Facebook users don’t actually like it — they click on it, which makes it more likely to show up in other users’ feeds, but they feel burned afterward: \"When we asked people in an initial survey what type of content they preferred to see in their News Feeds, 80% of the time people preferred headlines that helped them decide if they wanted to read the full article before they had to click through.\" So Facebook says it will figure out if a post is \"click bait\" — instead of \"popular\" — by measuring how much time users spend reading this stuff when they click on it — the more the better — and how much they share it after they’ve read it — again, the more the better. Like other pronouncements Facebook has made about its News Feed changes, this one is sure to set off speculation about who Facebook is really trying to target here. Don’t expect much clarity from the company on this one. But regardless of who wins and loses here, the changes are a good reminder that people who build businesses on Facebook’s giant platform can’t ever breathe easy — what Facebook likes today might change tomorrow.

For the second time in less than a week, Jane McQueeny, a KU administrator in charge of sexual assault investigations at the university, spoke to students Tuesday afternoon about how the school handles reports of rape on campus. Just a few days earlier, McQueeny joined KU Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little and other officials at a Sept. 18 panel to answer questions from students on the same topic. Student activism on campus and online over how the university handles sexual violence has put continued pressure on the administration, and helped to prompt Gray-Little to announce on Sept. 11 that the university would create a task force of students, faculty and staff to review policies around sexual misconduct on campus. \"Every member of the KU community has an obligation to help shape the climate in which we work and study,\" Gray-Little said in an email outlining the task force and panel. \"I look forward to us all working together as we make sure that KU is a safe place for every member of our community. A single instance of sexual assault is one too many.\" Leaders of colleges facing criticism over sexual assault do not frequently field questions from students on the topic in public. But attendance at the Sept. 18 panel was less than half of the turnout for a student-organized forum the week before, on Sept. 9, according to students who attended both events. The administration\\'s actions and student activism follow a Huffington Post report earlier this month that the university considered community service too \"punitive\" as a punishment for \"nonconsensual sex.\" Students reacted by creating a video -- which included one anonymous survivor\\'s account of her sexual assault -- to warn people the campus was not safe. KU\\'s handling of the case has led to a federal investigation by the U.S. Department of Education\\'s Office for Civil Rights. More sexual assault survivors have come forward since the launch of the investigation. One unnamed student told the University Daily Kansan, a student newspaper, that when the university determined a male student who forced himself on her while she was drunk was responsible for \"non-consensual contact,\" \\u200eDirector of Student Conduct & Community Standards Nick Kehrwald determined no punishment would be levied since the perpetrator hadn\\'t actually violated the sexual harassment policy. Acting student body president Emma Halling told The Huffington Post that she has referred other survivors directly to federal investigators. \"My biggest concern right now is while, yes, our policies on face look like they\\'re compliant, in the actual process students are so alienated and disserved that they end up feeling worse about the process than when they went in,\" Halling said.

Ze noted KU\\'s administration has still not responded to a list of specific demands from the September Siblings. \"I do not know what it will take for the administration to accept their students’ demands,\" Entrikin said. \"We want to be proud of our school, but I cannot be proud of a university that pretends to protect victims of sexual violence, when they are really only protecting themselves.\" One of the group\\'s demands calls for the university to ensure the punishment for sexual assault is more severe than sanctions for plagiarism. However, according to information supplied by the university to HuffPost, out of 309 incidents of academic misconduct, including cheating and plagiarism, only two students were expelled and three were suspended by the university during the 2012-13 and 2013-14 school years at KU. By comparison, KU officials noted, 12 sexual assault investigations over a similar period resulted in six suspensions or expulsions. More than 1,200 people have signed a petition calling for, among other changes, a process to allow students to appeal the judgments in sexual assault and harassment complaints since 2012.

The first attack struck while Dickson, then 23 and just back from a vacation in South Africa, was attending a party in New York. She assumed that the piercing abdominal pains might be a legacy of her trip or, more likely, the consequence of bad sushi she had consumed before the party. As the pain worsened, Dickson remembers wondering, \"Is this what childbirth is like?\" The next morning she saw her family doctor in New Jersey, who sent her to the hospital for tests. Soon afterward, the symptoms disappeared, and when testing revealed nothing, Dickson said she \"moved on.\" Six months later, she experienced a second episode, followed by another a year later. The third attack would end far differently than the first two: Doctors at a New Jersey hospital decided that, based on the results of her CT scan, Dickson needed emergency surgery. [Doctors dismissed his pain as migraines. Then they said he had 24 hours to live.] Johanna Dickson thought her excruciating stomach pains were caused by food poisoning at first. It soon became clear the issue was more serious, but Dickson\\'s eventual diagnosis shocked both her and her doctors. (Deirdra O\\'Regan/The Washington Post) \"Something like this is very strange in a 24-year-old,\" said Kenneth A. Goldman, the surgeon who operated on Dickson in August 2008. Goldman said he approached her case with some trepidation, \"hoping for the best and assuming the worst.\" For Dickson, who now works as a book publicist in Manhattan, the first episode was a surprise. She had felt fine on vacation and been generally healthy during the previous year she had spent in South Africa on a college study program. Because she had worked with orphans who had HIV, Dickson underwent testing for infectious diseases after she returned to the United States from her year abroad. \"I assumed if there was anything serious, I’d find out about it,\" she recalled. The second attack, which caused stabbing pain so intense it woke her from sleep, passed fairly quickly; this time, she didn’t go to the doctor. But the pain during the third episode was much worse. Dickson, who was then living with her parents near Princeton, said that it began in the middle of the night and grew so unbearable that she began screaming. Her mother held her and tried to soothe her; in the morning, her parents rushed her to the doctor’s office. He decided that Dickson probably had food poisoning — she had bought fruit from a street vendor the previous day. Although her pain, which was mostly on her left side, seemed somewhat lessened, the doctor told Dickson’s parents that if it didn’t subside by noon, she should go to the hospital for an abdominal CT scan. One possibility was acute appendicitis, although that typically causes pain on the right side. [He couldn’t eat, drink or work. And doctors couldn’t explain his searing pain.] Dickson was little better by noon, and her parents took her to the hospital. Several hours later, an ER doctor entered the room and asked a series of rapid-fire questions. \"He wanted to know if I’d ever given birth, or had surgery or had a family history of colon problems,\" Dickson recalled. 1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The case files: Medical mysteries View Photos From a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating reaction to chemotherapy, here’s a look at perplexing medical mystery cases. Caption From a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating reaction to chemotherapy, here’s a look at perplexing medical mystery cases. Doctors were stumped by this 2-year-old boy’s symptoms. He had swollen thumbs, bleeding gums and anemia. He cried whenever anyone touched his legs. Doctors were running out of time. Read the case Cam Cottrill/For The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The answer to each question was no. \"Why?\" Dickson remembers her father inquiring. The doctor explained that the CT scan showed that Dickson’s pain was the result of a serious bowel obstruction. The most likely cause at her age was scar tissue from previous surgery. Another possibility was an inflammation of her colon. Because Dickson had never had any surgery — she had never been in a hospital — and no history of colon problems, doctors had no idea what was causing the obstruction. A surgeon was on his way to see her and would decide whether she needed an operation or whether the problem might resolve without it. [A simple test proved that a teen with stomach pain wasn’t a hypochondriac after all] A bowel obstruction occurs when the large or small intestine is partially or totally blocked, preventing food, fluids and gas from passing normally. It typically causes severe pain that may wax and wane. Through a morphine haze, Dickson remembers feeling terrified about the prospect of surgery. Goldman told Dickson and her parents that surgery was essential. \"I remember hearing something about my intestine being really badly tangled and that it was something you [usually] see in people over 60.\" The primary concern was that the obstruction was cutting off the blood supply to Dickson’s colon; an operation to untwist the intestine and relieve the obstruction was the only treatment. Causes of a blockage include a hernia; Crohn’s disease, a disorder that causes inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract; previous abdominal surgery, including a Caesarean section, which results in the formation of scar tissue; and a tumor. Goldman remembers wondering what he would find. \"I’ve seen 25-year-olds with metastatic colon cancer,\" he said. Shortly before 7 p.m., Dickson was wheeled into surgery. A surprising discovery In the operating room, Goldman discovered the source of the obstruction: a tumor the size of a plum in Dickson’s small intestine. He sent samples of the tumor — called frozen sections — to the pa\\xadthol\\xadogy lab and waited for the initial report. [She couldn’t stop coughing. Were fragrances to blame?] The pathologist found that the specimen contained abnormally shaped spindle cells — round in the middle with pointed ends. Because such a finding is rare and its implications unclear, Dickson’s pa\\xadthol\\xadogy samples were subsequently sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for a second opinion. In the meantime, Goldman decided that in case Dickson did have an invasive cancer, he needed to remove enough of her intestine — about 10 inches — to ensure that no malignancy remained. Dickson said she suffered no ill effects from the surgery. The next morning, Dickson recalled, Goldman explained that the first two episodes had probably been caused by the bowel partially twisting around the tumor and then untwisting. Once the tumor grew too large, surgery was essential. The Mayo pathologists classified the tumor as an extremely fibrous growth called a desmoid, a slow-growing mass that typically affects women younger than 40. Because the tumor was attached to the mesentery, the fold of tissue that connects the small intestine to the abdominal wall, the condition is also called mesenteric fibromatosis. About 900 desmoid tumors are diagnosed annually in the United States. There is disagreement about whether such tumors should be classified as benign — largely because they do not spread — or as a low-grade form of cancer. Dickson said she was told her tumor was benign. Surgery to remove desmoid tumors is the preferred treatment, but recurrence is common. Many desmoid tumors, which can develop anywhere in the body, have no known cause. Some occur in people with Gardner syndrome, a type of familial adenomatous polyposis, a genetic disorder that results in frequent colon polyps in adolescence and in early-onset colon cancer. [Why I hid my daughter’s medical diagnosis from her for as long as I could] No recurrence But in Dickson’s case, no genetic link could be found. Dickson said she underwent frequent monitoring the year after her surgery as well as a colonoscopy, which found nothing. She sees an oncologist periodically for follow-up, but so far the tumor has not recurred. In 2013, five years after the surgery, Dickson underwent a second abdominal operation, which involved removal of more of her intestine, to relieve pain caused by scar tissue from the 2008 operation. \"I thought, ‘Oh, my God, am I going to be doing this every five years?’ \" she remembered wondering. There is no way to prevent a recurrence — doctors don’t know what caused the tumor — but Dickson said she is careful about her diet, avoiding fried foods and dried fruit, which she has trouble digesting. These days stomachaches always get her attention. \"If Pepto [Bismol] doesn’t work after about 20 minutes,\" she said, \"I do get a little nervous.\" To Goldman, Dickson remains a singular event in his long surgical career. \"I’ve seen one case of this in my 32 years,\" he said. \"That was Johanna.\" Doctors were startled to find the cause of this 24-year-old’s excruciating pain',\n",

Speaking onstage at Carnegie Hall, Lady Gaga said that, like fellow honoree Malala Yousafzai, she was going to use her voice to speak up about her cover. \"I felt my skin looked too perfect. I felt my hair looked too soft,\" said the star. \"I do not look like this when I wake up in the morning... I don\\'t even look like this,\" referring to her wild wig and makeup for the evening. Speaking slowly and measuredly, Gaga made it clear that the way covers like hers are tweaked and smoothed has damaging effects on the readers who see them. She urged the young people listening to \"fight back against the forces that make them feel like they\\'re not beautiful,\" and she also called for the publications themselves to change: \"It is fair to write about the change in your magazines. But what I want to see is the change on your covers... When the covers change, that\\'s when culture changes.\" Gaga\\'s outspoken critique was a bold move, given that she was receiving an award from the very magazine she was critiquing. But the overarching message of her lengthy speech was acceptance, particularly of people\\'s quirks, tastes and appearances.

              "  'context': 'Singing fish actually exist – and these are not the kind that people see in cartoons or children’s movies, too. The plainfin midshipman fish sound like a bunch of kazoos, and people on boats in the San Francisco Bay area have had to get used to a low humming sound at night that stops when daylight approaches. Porichthys notatus, as its scientific name is, has a specific reason for singing. The male fish use them to try to mate, while the females only grunt in response. The unusual sound has been likened to \"an orchestra full of mournful, rasping oboes,\" according to the San Francisco Gate in 2004. Researchers from Cornell University believe they have finally discovered what causes the strange melody: melatonin. Melatonin, a hormone naturally produced by plants and animals, is released at night, the Washington Post reports. In animals – like humans – that sleep a night, melatonin is believed to control the internal body clock, telling the rest of the body that it’s tie to sleep. Some have even found a treatment for insomnia in taking melatonin supplements before going to bed. But how melatonin functions in vertebrates that come alive at night has been unclear. Nocturnal animals do make melatonin when night comes, meaning it doesn’t put them to sleep. The new study suggests that melatonin may be more of a trigger to signal night-specific behaviors, including prompting midshipman fish to sing. \"Our results, together with those of others that also show melatonin’s actions on vastly different timescales, highlight the ability of hormones in general to regulate the output of neural networks in the brain to control distinct components of behavior,\" Andrew Bass, the lead author, says. He explains that with melatonin in particular, \"one hormone can exert similar or different effects in diurnal vs. nocturnal species depending on the timescale of action, from day-night rhythms to the duration of single calls.\" The researchers tested how melatonin works by keeping the fish in total darkness and in constant light. In the dark, the fish carried out their same routine, but in the light, there was no singing. The researchers then gave the fish in the light an artificial melatonin boost and they suddenly began singing, though at irregular times. The study was published in Current Biology.

The interview teased a lot of cool upcoming reveals including an updated hand-to-hand combat system. Earlier this week, it was confirmed that Battlefield 1 would be getting its first proper gameplay reveal during E3, where the game’s 64-player multiplayer mode will be shown to the public and press for the first time. The producer teased some really interesting stuff when speaking to OXM (Official Xbox Magazine), the most interesting of which was a new melee system that the team is adding to the game, especially in the multiplayer portion. Although he didn’t go into details but he was quick to state that since Battlefield 1 takes place during world war 1, the game is from an era which didn’t have modern day weapons or combat, and hand-to-hand combat among soldiers was almost medieval. This brutal style of melee combat would be portrayed in the game, according to him. When you look at the kind of all-out war, you have air, land, sea and a big part of the fighting on the actual ground was almost the – if you put yourself in the position of the soldiers back then when they got their state-of- the-art machine guns, but then they can turn the corner and then there is a guy with a big trench mace, it’s almost medieval and it’s that clash of those two worlds that we felt like this is really something that we need to have in the game and it really adds something to it. It’s a brutal side to – brutal and personal side to kind of the combat in Battlefield 1. He also confirmed that the levolution mechanic that Battlefield 4 introduced and Hardline also utilized, would be making a return with Battlefield 1. The system would also be enhanced and the team was hard at work creating a more ‘dynamic destruction’ experience with the new game. Battleships were also confirmed for the game but he didn’t really confirm whether or not Zeppelins would also be a part of the game.

              "  'context': 'And recently, even more articles have been focused on the seismic activity, like this one claiming that Yellowstone is \"shaking like crazy.\" Part of the speculation about increased activity comes from two earthquakes about 32 miles west of the park\\'s boundary last week: one was magnitude 4.3 on June 13 followed by a 4.0 on June 14. In February, Jackson was hit with a 4.0 as well. In the last five years, according to USGS data, there was only one other earthquake within roughly the same distance with a magnitude of 4.0 or higher. (Note: Yellowstone National Park reports that the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem actually saw five alone in 2010.) So, we spoke with the Wyoming Geological Survey to find out if activity has gotten crazier. The answer is: no, no it hasn\\'t. If anything, Yellowstone\\'s significant seismic activity decreased significantly over the last 60 years. Wyoming Geological Survey\\'s Division Manager of Groundwater and Geologic Hazards and Mapping, Seth Wittke, says that those quakes were likely caused by geologic features unrelated to the Yellowstone caldera. Wittke said anything outside of a 10-mile radius from the park boundary is likely unconnected. In 1959, a 7.3-7.5 magnitude earthquake hit Hebgen Lake in Yellowstone, which spurred significant aftershocks for the next few decades. In the 1960s, Wittke said there were 32 earthquakes that measured over 4.0 within the 10-mile radius of the park. There 37 more in the 1970s, but then it dropped to 12 in the 1980s. And in the last 26 years, there have only been five over 4.0. The following information was provided by Yellowstone National Park Geoscientist intern Jacob Thacker: \"Indeed, earthquake activity in Yellowstone is very commonplace and it is one of the more seismically active areas in the United States. That is not always cause for worry, and it is actually a good thing, as it keeps the \"plumbing system\" clear for many of the thermal features. However, as you guessed, the geysers and other thermal features are very dynamic and in constant change. This is perhaps best observed at Mammoth Hot Springs. We have also received reports of some interesting activity at Norris Geyser Basin this year, which we will continue to monitor to gain more understanding. \" That stated, we monitor the thermal features here in a number of ways. For example, we monitor eruption intervals by placing temperature sensors in runoff channels of prominent geysers throughout the park, and we use thermal infrared imagery from satellites and airplanes to look at annual changes in various thermal basins. Our interpretive rangers, who are in their respective geyser basins daily, are also a great resource for passing along any new and unusual activity. In addition, there are a number of citizen science volunteers who monitor geyser activity within the major geyser basins of the park, and we keep in close contact with USGS and University of Utah scientists who specialize in everything from volcanic gases to earthquakes. Interesting changes certainly happen all the time, but this is pretty much the name of the game here in Yellowstone, and part of the excitement. \"M agnitude 4.0 earthquakes have been fairly common since 1980 and that there really is no cause for concern.\" #reboot #buckrail #county10 #springcity #dally #oilcity #county17 #shortgo #news Across the internet, people are always talking about the massive caldera beneath Yellowstone and hypothesizing about when it is going to blow up and take more than half the continent with it.

Just look at the size of this thing. The images emerged last week from a man in Victoria, Australia, who seems to have found the frog in his garden. However, as any frog sex enthusiast will tell you, frogs don\\'t have penises. Most frog species mate in a process called amplexus, where fertilization of eggs occurs outside the body. As Gerry Marantelli from the Australian Amphibian Research Centre told BuzzFeed News , this impressive piece of manhood is most likely to be an \"extra partially formed leg.\" Yep, it\\'s literally a \"third leg.\" Gerry added: \"It’s not a penis, frogs don’t have them, but penises did evolve from ‘legs’ during embryonic development so an extra leg is part way there. Amphibians in one way likely invented the penis (albeit not the modern one).\" But don’t feel too sorry for frogs. Like many species of birds, reptiles, and other amphibians, frogs have a cloaca. This organ, which can be found in both females and males, acts as passage for waste and sperm or eggs (on a offbeat side note, some turtles can even breath out of them). The males of the tailed frog species actually have an extended reproductive tract that it uses to funnel sperm.

              "  'context': 'Many consumer products contain this common antimicrobial agent which can have a negative impact on the human health. Triclosan is a synthetic antimicrobial agent that can upset bacterial communities in the gut, a new study suggests. Use of triclosan can also lead to ‘superbugs’ which are bacteria that are fully resistant to antimicrobials (e.g. antibiotics). Triclosan was first introduced in the 1970s in hospital scrub soap and is now found in many consumer products, such as: toys, cosmetic products, deodorants, toothpastes, mouth washes, shampoos, detergents, bedding, kitchen utensils, cutting boards, trash bags, and surgical cleaning treatments. Triclosan is absorbed through the skin easily and traces can be found in most people’s urine. Dr Thomas Sharpton, an author of this study said: \"There has been a legacy of concern about exposure to microbial pathogens, which has led to increased use of these antimicrobial products. However, there’s now a growing awareness of the importance of the bacteria in our gut microbiome for human health, and the overuse of antibiotics that can lead to the rise of ‘superbugs’. There are consequences to constantly trying to kill the bacteria in the world around us, aspects we’re just beginning to understand.\" Exposure to triclosan makes changes to the microbial community structure and the diversity of microorganisms. Also, some bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae are vulnerable and some — such as those in the Pseudomonas family — are resilient to the impact of triclosan. Scientists believe that these changes can imbalance the bacteria in the gut, which in turn contributes to severe illnesses in humans. Dr Christopher Gaulke, lead author of the study, said: \"Clearly there may be situations where antibacterial agents are needed. However, scientists now have evidence that intestinal bacteria may have metabolic, cardiovascular, autoimmune and neurological impacts, and concerns about overuse of these agents are valid. Cumulative impacts are also possible. We need to do significantly more evaluation of their effects, some of which might be dramatic and long lasting.\" The gut microbiome is vital for human health as it improves immune system function, produces micronutrients and stops the growth of pathogens in the body. Abnormality in the gut microbiome can lead to conditions such as malnutrition, arthritis, diabetes and heart disease. The study was published in PLOS ONE (Gaulkeet al., 2016).

Mary Fallin (R) signed a bill Monday prohibiting cities across the state from establishing mandatory minimum wage and employee benefits, including vacation or sick leave days. Advocates of the new law contend that efforts to increase the minimum wage across various municipalities could potentially harm local business communities. \"This bill provides a level playing field for all municipalities in Oklahoma,\" state Rep. Randy Grau (R), a backer of the bill’s House version, said on Monday, according to the Associated Press. \"An artificial raise in the minimum wage could derail local economies in a matter of months. This is a fair measure for consumers, workers and small business owners.\" Opponents of the measure view the move by Oklahoma Republicans as retaliation against an initiative underway in Oklahoma City, where organizers have been gathering signatures to raise the city’s minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10, in line with President Barack Obama\\'s federal minimum wage proposal. The petition, filed by the Central Oklahoma Labor Federation and attorney David Slane, would need to collect 80,000 signatures to reach a statewide vote. Slane called the measure disappointing, criticizing the state legislature for stripping \"the right of the people to decide minimum wage.\" Fallin defended her support for banning a minimum wage hike as an effort to protect consumers in a press release Monday, noting that \"most minimum-wage workers are young, single people working part-time or entry-level jobs.\" \"Mandating an increase in the minimum wage would require businesses to fire many of those part-time workers. It would create a hardship for small business owners, stifle job creation and increase costs for consumers,\" Fallin said. \"And it would do all of these things without even addressing the goal of reducing poverty.\" According to a February report by the Congressional Budget Office, raising the minimum wage from its current level of $7.25 to $10.10, while indexing future increases to inflation, would boost collective earnings by $31 billion for 33 million low-wage workers and lift an estimated 900,000 people out of poverty.

Last week Australian golfer Jason Day admitted the higher the stakes before a tournament, the worse he sleeps. \"Usually if I’m in contention at the tournament, I don’t sleep at all,\" Day said during a press conference before the weekend’s RBC Heritage tournament in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, CBS reported. \"Usually if Sunday rolls around and I’m in contention -- I have a chance to win and I’m right there -- Sunday night I get no sleep. ... I’m so amped up from what’s going on that day,\" he added. If I\\'m in contention and I have a chance to win I get no sleep -- I\\'m so amped up from what\\'s going on that day. Jason Day, pro golfer Day is not alone Pro golfer or not, Day is not alone in losing sleep when he has something on his mind. Seven out of 10 adults in the U.S. report experiencing some stress or anxiety every day -- and 70 percent of those people say it interferes with their sleep, according to a survey from the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. And there’s plenty of scientific evidence to explain why stress hormones mess with the body’s sleep cues. But seriously, he\\'s really not doing himself any favors Even after as little as one night of poor sleep, studies have shown people are less focused and more likely to be forgetful. Other studies have shown sleep helps the body solidify muscle memory, too -- and actually boost athletic performance. Just last week, Andre Iguodala of the Golden State Warriors said there was a direct relationship between the quality of his sleep and his performance on the court. The NBA All-Star was speaking to students at Stanford University with Huffington Post Media Group\\'s Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington. He takes sleep so seriously, he said, he changed his bedtime routine, moved his TV and phone out of his bedroom in favor of reading material, and practices breathing exercises and stretches before hitting the sheets. But it\\'s not all bad news Luckily for Day -- and anyone else with a high-stakes event coming up -- there’s no need to actually lose sleep. When anxiety is triggered by your own thinking, which is often the case, you have the ability to redirect your thoughts and actually get to sleep faster, Steve Orma, a clinical psychologist and author of Stop Worrying and Got to Sleep: How to Put Insomnia to Bed for Good, previously told HuffPost. Orma suggests these five steps to lower anxiety before bed and fall asleep faster: Identify what you’re worried about: Finding the source of your anxiety is the first step to banishing it, Orma said. Get out of bed: If you end up staying in bed while you lay awake, you may start subconsciously associating being in bed with being awake. Address what’s on your mind: Research shows actually writing down on paper what\\'s making you anxious and then throwing it away can help Research shows actually writing down on paper what\\'s making you anxious and then throwing it away can help clear out negative thoughts Change your bedtime: You might just not be tired enough, Orma said. If all else fails, quietly engage your mind: Read, listen to music or practice meditation -- and take solace in the fact that a little anxiety is completely normal. (But if insomnia or anxiety is starting to affect your day-to-day life, consider seeking help from a professional, Orma said.) Unfortunately for Day, the golfer ended up losing his number one ranking and falling out of the top finishers at RBC Heritage. He took this week off and was not able to comment for this article.

              "  'context': \"Most people would think that if it's not good looks that make a man most attractive to women, then it's definitely a sense of humor. But studies consistently show that altruism is a top quality women are drawn to when they are looking for a relationship. And a new study in the British Journal of Psychology found that altruistic men may have more sex, too. The researchers asked unmarried Canadian adults how much they did good deeds like giving money to charity or helping someone get their car out of the snow. They then asked the participants how often they had sex and how many partners they've had. Men who reported more altruistic acts had more sex — and more partners. For those who were in relationships, good-hearted men were more likely to have had more sex in the last 30 days, too. mangostock/Shutterstock In the second experiment of the study, the researchers had undergraduate students say whether they would like to donate money that they might receive for participating to charity. Those who said that they would also tended to have more casual sex, more sex in relationships, and more lifetime sex partners overall. Another study, published in January 2016 in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, presented 202 women with different men to choose from. The different combinations of choices were either attractive or not, and they either did a good deed or didn't. The women chose the selfish, attractive men for a one-night stand. But for a long-term relationship, they chose the altruistic man whether he was attractive or not. A slightly older study, published in The Journal of Social Psychology in 2013, really drives this home. That study found that women valued altruism above other traits as a measure of whether a potential mate would make a good parent. The women also said that altruism was important for short-term relationships, but significantly more women said that the trait mattered for the long term. Yet another study, published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in July 2015, analyzed Germans' responses to a large annual survey. Single people who reported doing good deeds were much more likely to say that they were in a relationship the next year. They also took less time to find a partner than their non-altruistic peers. All of this is not to say that other traits don't matter. Humor is also important to women selecting a mate, researchers have found. It makes women assume that a man is more intelligent. A sense of humor is a good indicator of sexual activity, too. In one study, men whom women rated as funnier reported having more sex with more partners. For building long-term relationships, though, researchers find over and over again that altruism is a crucial and highly desirable trait. Psychologists have yet to pit humor head-to-head against altruism. It's also important to keep in mind that many of these studies are small, and that people often behave differently in real life than they do in a lab setting, or when responding to a survey. Especially when reporting positive experiences like charity work or sex, men may be more likely to overestimate how much they actually do those things. And because of the way that these kinds of studies are designed, they can't say conclusively that it's altruism specifically that's attractive. It might be other traits associated with altruism, or that men attractive for other reasons might also happen to be altruistic. But the large number of studies and the consistent findings in favor of altruism are building a pretty solid case that there are some side benefits to doing good deeds.

              "  'context': 'What does it take to get to the top -- without losing your center? Our \"Making It Work\" series profiles successful, dynamic women who are standouts in their fields, peeling back the \"hows\" of their work and their life, taking away lessons we can all apply to our own. Michelle Ashford, an Emmy-nominated writer for the HBO miniseries \"The Pacific,\" does not consider herself successful -- at least not according to her definition: \"having felt that what you did mattered, that it had meaning.\" \"I think my children matter, and they have great meaning. And I have fantastic friends, and I think that has meaning,\" Ashford explains. \"But in terms of my career, I don’t think that I’m there yet, no. But I have my eye on that.\" Ashford is taking another step toward that goal as creator of the new Showtime series \"Masters of Sex,\" about famed sex researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson, which premieres on September 29. Why do you do the work you do? What I love so much about writing is it’s like you’re a perpetual student. You have 30 books on your desk, and it’s like going back to school. For example, I didn’t really know anything about Masters and Johnson, just vaguely, and then I read Thom Maier’s biography and I thought,\"Wow, what a fascinating world.\" So now I’m immersed in that. It\\'s like traveling without having to leave your desk. Ashford working in her home office. Did you end up in this profession by design or by accident? It was not always the plan. I was an economics major, and I had vague notions of \"maybe I’ll be a lawyer,\" \"maybe I’ll be a businesswoman.\" It was basically me floating around with no direction. Then my last year of college, I took an elective television class, and I made a documentary on hospice care. I thought, \"Well, this is so much more fun than economics.\" So I decided I would come to LA. I had no contacts and I had every horrible job imaginable for a long time. And then the people who kept sort of pulling me along with them were people in television. But I had no idea if I could write so I finally quit doing all these assistant jobs, and I tried to write a script. When you say you had \"every horrible job imaginable,\" are you talking about the assistant jobs? I was a page at Channel 5 in Los Angeles, KTLA, where you wore a polyester uniform and sat live audiences for shows. I was paid like $80 every two weeks. Then I was a receptionist. Then I was a PA and had to get everyone lunch. So it was all jobs within the industry, but they were the most bottom-level, menial jobs. But in the process of doing these jobs, I would meet people. I would say, \"Please, if you go to another job, will you take me?\" And they often would. So that was how I slowly got to understand how the TV business works. Do women have a responsibility to help other women at work? It’s a very curious thing, the idea of looking at what I do and separating it by sex. When I first started, I was on the staffs of shows where I was the only girl and yet I didn’t ever have the feeling of being held back or marginalized because I was a female. I know other people have felt that. I haven’t. That being said, I don’t know that I need to make it a mission to cultivate women because they’re women, but I do look for really talented women and try to bring them onboard. This is what happens with hiring minority writers as well. When you’re doing my job, you have to hire the best writers, period. However, when you do find someone that’s really talented that’s a woman or some kind of minority, then it’s thrilling to plant your flag and say, \"This is my person.\" Oddly enough, on \"Masters of Sex,\" three of our episodes were directed by women, our staff was half women, my producing partner is a woman. A lot of the people that have interviewed us say, \"Wow, this whole show is run by women.\" We look at each other and think, \"We didn’t design it that way.\" And that’s actually pretty great. Ashford with \"Masters of Sex\" co-executive producer Sarah Timberman. Do you have a work persona and a non-work persona? I’m in charge of a lot of people, so when I go to work, I feel the responsibility to be bit of a cheerleader and to keep everything on track so it’s a very extroverted personality that needs to show up and do my job. But the truth is at heart I’m a writer, and that is an incredibly introverted sort of character. I think I’m an introvert that has to act like an extrovert a lot. Are you close friends with anyone you work with or have worked with in the past? Yes, very close. Everyone I’ve ever been with romantically, I met through work. Some of my very, very best friends I met through work. One of the nice things about being on television shows is you are thrown in with people in such an intimate and time-intensive way that you get to know them really well. Did you meet your husband, Greg Walker, working on a show? I was his boss actually, although I was very well behaved. I had a previous husband, and I met him through work. And you have kids? I have two kids, 9 and 11. It was a lucky coincidence that I happened to pick a career -- or a career picked me -- that was actually conducive to having children. Had I been a lawyer, I don’t know how I would have done it. The thing about writing is I could write at home. I never stopped working when I had kids at all. Ashford with husband Greg Walker and sons Ben and Sam before the Emmys. Have you ever been in the situation where the big meeting at work coincided with the school play or something else involving your kids? Yes. I decide to go with whatever involves my kids. I work with a lot of people who have kids, and they get it. And I have not found anybody saying, \"This is a dealbreaker.\" So I just stick with that. What’s the distribution of work like in your household? I’m much more in charge of everything that goes on in our household, although he’ll make lunches or he’ll take the kids to school if I can’t. I still think that women do much more of that than men. Luckily, my husband is a great cook. In terms of cleaning up the mess, it’s always me. Ashford with her family in the costume department of \"Masters of Sex.\" Did your mother work? My mother died about five years ago. When I was growing up, she was a stay-at-home mom. She was a good cook, and she helped us with homework and took us to our music lessons, and she was very present. When we went to college, she got a job working at the Claremont colleges in development. Did she understand why you work the way you do? I think my mother was secretly very pleased that I worked and slightly envious. My mother was very smart, an incredible reader, and I think there was a part of her that thought, \"The fact that all I’ve done is just raise children is not entirely satisfying.\" She was really happy that she raised three kids, but I think part of her felt a little bit restless. Tell me about an average workday vs. a great workday. An average workday is one with a million distractions. I’m running around and forget to eat and look up and go, \"Oh my god, it’s 5:30 already and this day is not even two-thirds over.\" That’s sort of an average day, which is not bad, but feels exhausting and fragmented. A great day for me is a really good writing day, which is just being quiet in my office and getting a lot done and feeling really pleased by what I’ve written. Ashford with \"The Pacific\" co-producer Robert Schenkkan at the 2011 Writers Guild Awards. When was the most recent time you thought about quitting your job? Oh, I think about quitting it all the time. I do love writing, but writing is different from engaging in the business part of what we do. I get very fatigued with what the marketplace is saying is good material and what is not. I have this fantasy that someday I’ll never have to read Deadline again. Do you keep your phone next to your bed? No. I detest my cell phone and forget it about half the day. I understand the need for cell phones, but I think they’re pernicious and I think the idea of being glued to your phone is awful. I still have a landline and I will keep it till the day that I die. Is your to-do list electronic or paper? Paper. I still have an address book that’s handwritten. I don’t even have people’s contacts in my computer. That’s how prehistoric I am. The writers\\' room of \"Masters of Sex. Each card represents a scene. Do you get enough sleep? No, but it’s not because I’m staying up so late. The problem is I have a lot on my mind, and I find that I wake up. So I have a little secret life in the middle of the night, where I sometimes read or just think about what I’m working on. Many times I’ve gotten up and worked. I try not to do that too much because sometimes if you get going, then you’ve been up since 3. I find actually the thinking in the middle of the night can be incredibly helpful for what you have to do the next day. I’ve actually solved a lot of story problems, so while it’s annoying, maybe it happens to me for a reason. Do you get enough exercise? I try to at least get to a gym twice a week. I try to go for a walk other times. I don’t get enough exercise, but I don’t see how I can fit any more in than I already am. Are you paid what you’re worth? That’s a very tricky question because people in the entertainment business tend to be paid a lot, and if you compare what I do to a woman exactly my age who is teaching in a public school and trying her damnedest to give kids the best shot at a good life, no, I’m overpaid. She should be taking some of my money. But it is what the market will bear, and so I don’t send my checks back and I’m grateful for them. And when you’re in the thick of it, you think, \"My god, they should double my salary.\" But in the bigger picture, I think people in entertainment and sports are overpaid. What would you title your autobiography? \"She Tried.\" Is there a woman you know of who is Making It Work? We’d love to include her in our series.

Tech fans are now waiting for the tech monster to unleash their successors. Reports have been pumping the internet that Google will introduce a couple of new smartphones under a new title, the upcoming smartphones of Google will be called Pixel (was named as Nexus Sailfish) and Pixel XL (formerly called Nexus Marlin), which means that the Nexus branding is going down the drain. It seems like Google is trying to bring a new brand into existence that will catch the consumer's attention, a brand that will not only include the tech company's smartphones, but some of their other devices.

              "  'context': 'Marijuana has long been touted for being virtually side-effect free. Now, according to one new study, long-term marijuana use may have one negative caveat: gum disease. After analyzing about 1,000 cannabis users in New Zealand, researchers found that those who smoked pot for 20 or more years had few health problems — with the exception of gum disease. Lead researcher Madeline Meier, an assistant professor of psychology at Arizona State University, said of the findings, Unlike tobacco smoking, cannabis smoking is associated with few physical health problems in midlife, with the exception of periodontal disease... Our analyses show that this association was not explained by tobacco smoking, alcohol abuse or less tooth brushing and flossing. While the study doesn’t prove cannabis can cause gum disease, it does shed some light on the pros and cons that come with regular use, specifically smoking. A co-author of the study and professor of psychology at Duke University, Avshalom Caspi, said, What we’re seeing is that cannabis may be harmful in some respects, but possibly not in every way. We need to recognize that heavy recreational cannabis use does have some adverse consequences, but overall damage to physical health is not apparent in this study. While smoking weed every day for multiple decades surely has some negative side effects, using alternative methods like vaporizers and edibles could potentially mitigate some of those consequences. So don’t panic just yet, bud buddies. When it comes to cannabis, there’s a big, wide world out there with countless options still left to explore.

              "  'context': 'If you know a child with ADHD, you know hyperactivity can make it difficult for parents trying to raise happy, healthy children. And you know that the day after Halloween is one of the most disruptive days of the year! But did you know that many food and candy companies use unnecessary ingredients that can trigger hyperactivity, adding additional stress to families already coping with ADHD? Petroleum-based artificial food dyes are found in everything from cereal, yogurt, and granola bars to candy, chips, and even children\\'s medicines! Numerous scientific studies have demonstrated that dyes can cause hyperactivity in sensitive children. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration acknowledges that. But the FDA has refused to ban dyes or even require a warning notice on labels, as the European Union does for most dyes. Ahead of October 31 this year, the Center for Science in the Public Interest is working with the Shutters family from Jamestown, N.Y. to publicize renewed attention to the link between artificial dyes and hyperactivity in kids, get the word out to families affected by ADHD, and encourage companies to stop coloring foods with these harmful dyes. Renee Shutters is a member of the Feingold Association, a group that promotes the use of an elimination diet to treat hyperactivity and other symptoms in children, focusing especially on the removal of artificial food dyes from the diet. Her son Trenton, age 9, used to exhibit hyperactive behavior and had difficulty focusing at school and cooperating at hockey practice. After two days on the Feingold diet Trenton\\'s behavior improved dramatically, according to Ms. Shutters. \"Before he started the Feingold diet, Trenton was easily distracted at school and hockey practice. He was angry and disruptive and had trouble sitting through dinner or falling asleep at night,\" said Shutters. \"We decided to remove artificial dyes from his diet, and after two days of eating that way, his attitude and behavior improved greatly. Now, he brings light into the classroom and makes everybody laugh. Trenton excels in academics and sports, and he couldn\\'t have done it without this diet.\" Thousands of families have discovered that getting dyes out of their kids\\' diets improves the way the kids feel and behave. Their experiences are backed up by scientific research. A 2004 meta-analysis affirmed that artificial dyes increase hyperactivity. The United Kingdom\\'s Food Standards Agency has urged food companies remove dyes from their products based on two studies that it commissioned (on top of all the earlier evidence) that found that mixtures of dyes adversely affect the behavior of ordinary kids (not only kids thought to be sensitive). The European Union then required foods that contain any of the dyes used in those two British studies to bear a warning label. Those dyes include Red 40, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6 -- the three most widely-used dyes in the United States and Canada. Partly as a result of that action, very few foods in Europe contain the dyes and bear the warning notice. Mars is one of many companies that use natural colorings in products they market in Europe but artificial dyes to color the same products in the United States. M&M\\'s candies contain mostly natural dyes in Europe, but feature Red 40, Yellow 5 and 6, and Blue 1 and 2 in the United States version. We have launched a petition on Change.org to ask Mars to color M&M\\'s, the best-selling candy in the country, with only natural colorings in all markets. Don\\'t North American consumers don\\'t deserve the same health protection? Please join our effort if you agree Mars should get these neurotoxic chemicals out of M&M\\'s. And parents, please think twice before sending the neighborhood kids home with candy colored with artificial food dyes this Halloween. While most candies are junk, treats colored with artificial dyes can impact children in a much more serious way than naturally-colored treats. Passing out M&M\\'s (and other foods with dyes) may result in temper tantrums in your neighbors\\' homes and meltdowns the next day at school. When your own little witch or superhero comes home on Halloween with a bag full of sugar and artificial food dyes, here are some great tips from the Feingold Association to limit the damage.

The coauthors\\' conclusions weren\\'t based on intuition, but rather 25 years of Gallup studies of 80,000 managers across 400 companies. Over time, more companies began adopting Buckingham and Coffman\\'s prescribed approach, and now companies like Facebook operate entirely on their philosophy. Facebook HR chief Lori Goler recommends their book to all new managers In their book, Buckingham and Coffman define talent as \"a recurring pattern of thought, feeling, or behavior that can be productively applied.\" They say there are three types of talent to consider: Striving talents: \"They explain why he gets out of bed every day, why he is motivated to push and push just that little bit harder.\" \"They explain why he gets out of bed every day, why he is motivated to push and push just that little bit harder.\" Thinking talents: \"They explain how he thinks, how he weighs up alternatives, how he comes to his decisions.\" \"They explain how he thinks, how he weighs up alternatives, how he comes to his decisions.\" Relating talents: \"They explain whom he trusts, whom he builds relationships with, whom he confronts, and whom he ignores.\" It is up to the manager to determine a talents profile for the position they are looking to fill. It\\'s important, Buckingham told us , that this profile doesn\\'t become a checklist that guides the job interview. The worst thing a manager can do in an interview, he said, is ask too many follow-up questions in an attempt to find the answer they\\'re looking for. \"Every time you ask a question you give something away,\" he said. \"You don\\'t want to give anything away.\" Buckingham explained that the interviewer should be looking for frequent behaviors, and if the candidate is a great fit, they will naturally reveal these behaviors without prodding.

              "  'context': \"Would Samsung hobble its key hardware release by offering it with an older operating system. Would it be ready to accept the headaches of trying to force an update through the various carrier certification processes? In other words, will the cutting edge Galaxy Note 6 release with last year's version of Android? That's the intriguing prospect raised by SamMobile's look at the user-agent profiles showing up around the web from the next phablet from South Korea. The expectation is that Samsung would be the first commercial vendor to release a device with Android N - the seventh major version of Google's operating system - which would sit nicely with the new technology that is being crammed into the chassis to take on the might of the iPhone. Instead the user agent profile notes the SM-N930A is running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. It's also worth noting that the serial number suggests that this is a flat screened version of this year's note, and not the curved screen version that is reminiscent of the Galaxy S6 Edge and S7 Edge. Given that Samsung has been testing multiple version of the phablet that's not as much of a surprise as expected. At some point Samsung will have to decide which model to go with (or to run a dual model strategy). Asked about the choice of operating system for the Galaxy Note, Samsung declined to comment. Whatever choice is made on the physical hardware, the decision to go with an older version of Android is a curious one. Android N has only recently been made available and no matter how much testing is done in-house by Google and Samsung, there can be no substitute for a public debut and hundreds of thousands of users stressing the OS in the hours after launch. The chances of the code needing an immediate patch will be high, and that means trying to roll out an over-the-air change while under some pressure. And the Android ecosystem has historically had many issues in achieving timely updates. There's a certain level of pragmatism in going with Android Marshmallow for the Galaxy Note 6 launch. The phablet is a key 2016 device launch for Samsung and will boost interest in the overall Galaxy brand after the S7 and S7 Edge release in the spring. With Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus expected to launch three to four weeks after the Note, the last thing the South Korean company needs is a problem with the software coming to light just as Tim Cook takes to the stage. With so much new hardware going into the Note (I'm expecting the curved screen on some devices, dual-lens camera and the return of microSD to name three notable areas), going with Marshmallow is a safer option. Marshmallow is a known quantity, it has been tested by millions of users for the last year, and Samsung's software engineers will understand intimately how it works. A switch to Android N throws away those comfort factors. Yet moving forwards with Android N feels like the right thing to do. The Samsung Galaxy 6 (or perhaps the Note 7, the jury is out on the name) is packed with new features, innovative design, and screams 'progress!'. To have those hardware advancements backed up by the latest software techniques in Android N will present a united front and a statement that the Galaxy Note is the future of smartphones. It's harder to make that statement if Samsung uses Marshmallow and then organises a piecemeal roll-out of Android N at some point in the future. Now is not the time to play safe, now is the time to be aggressive and redefine the smartphone market on Samsung's terms while the competition is weak. Samsung should not be playing it safe with the Galaxy Note 6. New Galaxy Note 6 Leak Uncovers A Disturbing Missing Feature\",\n",

              "  'context': 'Women give more charity than men do, but that gap could potentially be closed if groups paid closer attention to the causes and messaging that speaks most to males. Noticing the nonprofit industry’s tendency to focus its efforts on targeting females, consulting group Good Scout conducted a study on men’s giving habits. It uncovered that men are most drawn to organizations that support children and that they respond to appeals that vary vastly from those that inspire women to give back. \"As strong as the response from women can be, over-targeting women causes us to fail to include men,\" the Good Scout study noted. \"As an industry we need to ask not if men will engage with causes but how we should work to motivate them.\" The organization surveyed more than 1,500 men across the U.S. of different ethnicities, ages and social status. It found that 52 percent of participants support -- or would support -- charities that help children. That was the most popular cause across all age groups. And while men’s monetary donations have dropped, their volunteering rates have \"skyrocketed\" over the past few years. The group noted that with more effective outreach efforts, nonprofits could get men to willfully open up their wallets. While men are active on social media, they use it predominantly for research and reading news, the study noted. They’re less likely than women to use Facebook and Twitter to communicate and share information, which is why nonprofits need to tailor how they effectively reach men. Men are more likely to respond to a message about a charitable issue that’s communicated at a networking event, through text message or with a video shared on a site they frequent. They also appreciate learning about a cause through word of mouth, from a friend or family member, which is why organizations also need to beef up their peer communication methods. Since men shared their overwhelming proclivity for children-related organizations, those groups need to effectively zero in on this demographic. \"This suggests the family dynamic may play an even larger role in motivating and activating men at every age to engage with causes,\" the Good Scout noted. \"Perhaps there is a general opportunity as a sector to look at how we are creating events, defining our impact, messaging through marketing and aligning with companies ... Infusing family in smart and strategic ways to motivate men to engage with a cause could just move the needle for your mission.\" The No. 1 Cause Men Care About The Most',\n",

              "  'context': 'Passion Pit has once again had to cancel shows, a decision that the band explained in a lengthy and intense open letter posted to the band\\'s website on Tuesday. Frontman Michael Angelakos and his bandmates posited three main reasons for cancellations: general illness, mental illness and weather. Angelakos suffers from bipolar disorder and has dealt with serious depression and survived suicide attempts in the past, but he writes now that \"this only hurt us a few times, and it was well over a year ago.\" There are many reasons bands or artists cancel shows. Here are a few of them, many of them have applied to us: 1) General Illness. Though many bands play through illness, sometimes it’s absolutely necessary to take a night off to ensure that the rest of the tour survives instead of beating your body up only to have to risk canceling more shows in the future. This is how so many singers lose their voices, or people develop long-term illnesses. It’s just not worth it. 2) Mental illness. Most of our fans know about my condition but this only hurt us a few times, and it was well over a year ago, and I work my ass of to make sure I can get out on stage and tour. More on how we made up all of these shows later. 3) Weather. Outdoor stages that are built into muddy grounds have caused death (so many examples of this). Rain and electronics, as we all know, also really don’t mix. Sometimes, other stationary stages are said to be \"rain or shine\" but do not actually have the capability of fully protecting the gear. As some of you may know, we lost SO much gear and money a few weekends ago due to a storm, and we’re not about to mess it up on our final trek for \"Gossamer.\" That could potentially end an entire tour and then that’d be it. No more touring. See you maybe in 2014. Not fun. The band stresses that they wouldn\\'t have canceled shows if they had any other choice, but that DJ\\'ing in place of performing during inclement weather didn\\'t really work out for them (they were heckled), and their equipment is too customized and expensive to risk damaging it like they did earlier this year. \"Please understand that if Passion Pit cancels a show, it’s canceling a show for a damn serious reason, and we’re not messing around with our fans,\" Angelakos writes. \"We’re trying our hardest and we are so sorry for the inconvenience. There’s only so much we can do.\" In asking fans to think before getting upset, Angelakos reminded them who really suffers when a concert is canceled: We lose the most. We lose the trust of our fans because of innocent naiveté, an ignorance in regards to how these things are done. WE lose the trust of those who don’t understand how many people are involved in our show, from our touring crew to local crew, how much planning goes on for months and months to prep, how much money is spent to keep the tour rolling, and how much we need to tour to make sure we can afford to put on the show we want to do and still end up being able to pay our bills and continue to do this for a living.

Most surprisingly, Richardson answered the question with a confident \"No.\" Africa’s apex predator, the lion, undoubtedly exhibits a majestic persona but is not to be mistaken for a household pet. Lions are at the top of the food chain and very rarely turn down a fight. While the female’s hunting skills surpass species nationwide, it is the male that holds the vigorous strength and most-feared stealth. \"They are social animals and they actually have the ability to be extremely affectionate,\" said Richardson. \"Having said that, they don’t actually understand their own strength and sometimes, unwittingly, just in play, they could injure you quite badly.\" Richardson inherited the name \"The Lion Whisperer\" years ago after dedicating his entire life to the conservation of big cats. On his YouTube channel, he is seen playing with the lions, riding on the male’s back and snuggling up with the females.

              "  'context': 'Parents leaving the hospital with newborns are a jumble of nerves and adrenaline, wondering what comes next and whether they\\'re going to do it right. But new research suggests that many new parents make at least one mistake before they even pull out of the driveway. More than 90 percent of new parents at one Oregon Hospital made at least one key error in installing their newborn\\'s car seat or in positioning the newborn in the seat, according to new research to be presented Monday at the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference. \"As someone who has been doing this for a number of years, I\\'ve always been struck by how difficult it can be for parents to adequately protect their children,\" study researcher Dr. Benjamin Hoffman, a professor of pediatrics at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital at Oregon Health & Science University and a certified car passenger safety technician, told The Huffington Post. To conduct the study, Hoffman and his team observed 267 sets of babies and caregivers who were discharged from Doernbecher\\'s mother-baby unit between fall 2013 and spring 2014. (For the purposes of the study, the caregiver was either the newborn\\'s parent or an adult designated by the parent.) As the families prepared to leave, safety technicians watched them install the car seat in their vehicle and place the baby in the seat, in order to screen for what the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has deemed \"critical misuses.\" On average, researchers found 4.2 misuses per family. Ninety percent of the families made two or more errors, while 50 percent made five or more. Caregivers were more likely to make mistakes positioning their newborns in the car seat, rather than installing the seat itself. Sixty-eight percent did not sufficiently tighten the harness, while 33 percent placed the harness retainer clip too low. Other errors included using the wrong harness slot, not knowing how to adjust the harness at all and using a non-regulated product in conjunction with the car seat. When it came to setting up the seat, the most common error was installing the seat too loosely, a mistake 43 percent of families made. Other common errors included angling the car seat incorrectly, using a seat belt but not locking it, and putting incorrect spacing between the car seat and the vehicle\\'s front seat. \"We collaborated with parents to correct any misuses before they left the hospital ... and parents were incredibly grateful to know they were traveling home as safely as possible,\" Hoffman said. \"Everyone was very well-intentioned in this process, but many families were very surprised to find out how many errors they made.\" Hoffman noted that the study\\'s findings were in line with a broader 2004 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which found that 84 percent of rear-facing car seats had at least one critical misuse. Notably, the researchers found that families were 13 times more likely to correctly position their babies and car seats if they had arranged a visit with a certified car passenger safety technician, or CPST, before heading to the hospital. \"I always recommend that parents go to seatcheck.org to find a CPST in their area if they don\\'t know one already, because they will help guide them through whatever they need to know,\" said Jamie Grayson, owner of BabyGuyGearGuide.com and a certified CPST himself. Many smaller retailers have a dedicated technician on staff, he added, who can help parents work through installation issues before they buy a car seat. \"Read your manual,\" Grayson urged. \"Both your car seat manual and your car manual.\" He also recommended that new parents bring their car seat into the hospital room with them and practice positioning their baby in it before they head out to the parking lot. Hoffman said that he would like to see hospitals provide car seat technicians who can work with families upon discharge, and hopes that car seat manufacturers will continue to innovate and engineer car seats that are more intuitive for parents to install and use. \"This study suggests that newborns, and families of newborns, are more vulnerable than the general public and we need to think differently about how we can help them and provide resources,\" Hoffman said. The true impact of the errors measured in the new study is impossible to quantify, Hoffman said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that car seat use reduces the risk of fatal injuries among babies 1 year old and under by 71 percent, though car accidents remain a leading cause of death among children in the United States.

In this year\\'s survey, Boston, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, tied for third place.

The beheadings reflected an alarming trend in 2014 in which international journalists were increasingly targeted and killed. There were at least 60 journalists killed globally in connection to their work in 2014, according to an annual report from the Committee to Protect Journalists, an organization that advocates for press freedom around the world. The latest death was Afghan cameraman Zubair Hatami, who died Saturday from injuries he sustained in a Taliban attack. Committee to Protect Journalists is still investigating whether the deaths of 18 journalists were related to their work. Reporters Without Borders recently cited 66 journalist killings in its 2014 survey. The difference likely results from each organization\\'s methodology and the ongoing investigation of some cases. Syria, mired in civil war since 2011, ranked as the most dangerous country for journalists for the third year in a row. Seventeen journalists were killed in the war-torn country this year, bringing the total to 79 in the conflict. The organization found four journalists and three media workers killed covering the war in Gaza, five journalists in Iraq, and five journalists and two media workers in Ukraine. While this year’s overall toll is down from the 70 killed in 2013, the Committee to Protect Journalists found that international journalists were more frequently targeted this year than in the past. \"Reflecting in part the increasingly volatile nature of conflict zones in which Westerners are often deliberately targeted, about one quarter of the journalists killed this year were members of the international press, about double the proportion CPJ has documented in recent years,\" the report concluded. \"Over time, according to CPJ research, about nine out of every 10 journalists killed are local people covering local stories.\" As threats against international correspondents grew in 2014, the organization noted that \"the overwhelming majority of journalists under threat for their work continue to be local.\" 60 Journalists Killed In 2014 As Targeting Of International Press Rises, Study Finds',\n",

              "  'context': \"Expectant mothers living close to busy roads are at greater risk of serious complications in pregnancy, experts have found. Pre-eclampsia – a condition suffered by 42,000 pregnant women in Britain each year – is made more likely by noise and pollution from roads, according to a large study. Researchers believe the toxins from vehicles and sound of traffic from nearby roads may increase stress levels and cause inflammation that leads to rising blood pressure associated with the condition. The Danish study of 73,000 women - the first to establish a link between traffic and pre-eclampsia - adds to growing concerns about the health impact of air and noise pollution. Earlier this week a separate study published in the Lancet medical journal warned people who live near roads are also at significantly higher risk of developing dementia. Those concerns add to established evidence that traffic fumes increase the risk of heart disease and asthma. NHS watchdog NICE last month called for urgent action to tackle the problem, warning that air pollution contributes towards 25,000 deaths a year in England - almost 5 per cent of all deaths. Despite overwhelming evidence of health inpacts, the UK has struggled to control air pollution, with 37 cities across Britain persistently breaching legal limits of air toxins set by the EU. Pre-eclampsia affects around 6 per cent of pregnancies in the UK - and in severe cases can lead to stillbirth or maternal death. The new results may help to explain why until recently rates of preeclampsia have been increasing in many countries. It could also provide some clues about the underlying causes of pre-eclampsia. Researchers found that for every 10-decibel increase in noise from traffic – roughly a doubling in audible volume - there was a 10 per cent increase in the risk of pre-eclampsia and high blood pressure problems in pregnant women. Similarly, for every 0.01 micrograms of nitric dioxide from car exhausts in a litre of air - a tiny increase - the risk of the condition rose by 7 per cent. Study leader Professor Marie Pedersen, of the University of Copenhagen, said: ‘The rise in risk we saw is significant in terms of impact on a population level, as a 10-unit increase in pollution and noise is very small.’ Pre-eclampsia usually occurs in the second half of pregnancy and can lead to problems with the flow of blood through the placenta. Warning signs include high blood pressure, swelling in their feet, face and hands, severe headaches, vision problems and pain below the ribs. As the delivery of nutrients can be hampered by the problems with the placenta, it can restrict the growth of the unborn baby. There is currently no cure for the condition and often babies need to be delivered early to prevent it from worsening. Pre-eclampsia and hypertensive disorders are among the leading causes of maternal death and stillbirth. Around 500 babies are thought to die in the UK each year as a result of the condition. Those at the highest risk include women who are obese, have high blood pressure before they are pregnant, those suffer from diabetes or have a family history of preeclampsia. Professor Pedersen said her study shines new light on the root causes of the condition, which has been poorly understand in the past. She said: ‘Air pollution causes inflammation and oxidative stress, which has been linked to damage to blood vessels, immune system changes and elevated blood pressure. ‘Noise may induce stress and disturb sleep, which has also been associated with similar changes. ‘We observed the strongest effects for mild pre-eclampsia and early-onset of pre-eclamsia.’ She and her colleagues, whose work is published in the journal Epidemiology, studied data collected from 72,745 pregnancies in Denmark and modelled the noise and air pollution at their addresses. They found women living in areas where road traffic was heaviest in their first three months of pregnancy had the highest risk of developing pre-eclampsia, when all other factors had been controlled for. Even when they tried to separate noise from air pollution they found both seemed to have an impact on the condition. Mothers living close to busy airports, where the noise of aircraft continually taking off and landing can be heard, and train routes also have an increased risk. Professor Pederson said: ‘If our findings are true, they could have public health implications given the large burden associated with these outcomes and the fact that exposure to both air pollution and noise are difficult to avoid in modern society. ‘We expect that the findings from our study and other studies add support to policies that aim to reduce exposure to air pollution and noise.’ Professor James Walker of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said: ‘This research into traffic noise is interesting and warrants further investigation – especially as there is increasing evidence on the impact of increased air pollution from cars on poor health. ‘While the exact cause of pre-eclampsia is unknown, it is important to reassure women that there are likely to be a variety of contributory factors that lead to a diagnosis – probably to do with the placenta - rather than just exposure to traffic noise.'

              "  'context': 'Chris Evans is synonymous with his role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) as Steve Rogers aka Captain America but another actor had been on the shortlist for the career-changing role John Krasinski. Since Krasinski lost out on the part more than nine years ago, he’s joined the list of iconic characters almost by other actors and still hasn’t let Evans forget it. Evans first donned Captain America’s suit and carried the comic book character’s shield in 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger. But during the casting process for the movie, it had been a close race. Krasinski later said he even did an audition in full costume, according to Screenrant.  In the end, the role of Captain America went to Evans who, of course, went on to become a household name for his portrayal of the superhero, earning millions and millions of dollars for each Avengers film. Today, he has an estimated net worth of $50 million.  John Krasinski wasn’t mad he lost out on playing Captain America to Chris Evans Nearly a decade later with all the Avengers movies complete, Krasinski hasn’t stopped teasing his fellow actor for nabbing the role of Captain America. But it’s all in good fun. When the 40-year-old, who is now married to Emily Blunt, found out Evans got cast as Captain America instead of him, he wasn’t upset but rather happy for him. They’d known each other for years and there wasn’t any ill will about the role.  In a Feb. 2020 interview with Esquire, Krasinski said he wasn’t competitive about the role or upset in any way when Evans beat him out for the part. \"People have a sense that some of us are insanely competitive. I’ve known Chris forever. So as soon as they said Chris Evans got the part, I was like, ‘Yeah, look at that guy. Are you kidding me? He is Captain America,’\" he said.  He and Chris Evans are ‘still laughing about it’ In the same interview, Krasinski said he had recently crossed paths with Evans shortly before sitting down with the publication, and there wasn’t any bad blood between them, only jokes. \"And I just saw Chris a couple of weeks ago and we were still laughing about it. I said, ‘I love that you retired in my role,’\" Krasinski said.  This wasn’t the first time Krasinski talked about losing out to Evans for the role of Captain America. In a 2016 interview witih Collider he called Evans’ performance as the superhero \"fantastic\" and on another occasion told Total Film he’d been happy to have the freedom to pursue other projects as opposed to being committed to multiple Marvel movies.  Appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in Feb. 2020, Krasinski recounted a funny story involving his Captain America audition and trying on the costume. Plus, he said he ultimately felt relieved about getting passed over for the role because had he gotten it, he would’ve missed out on other opportunities.  While we won’t know what Krasinski would’ve been like as Captain America, we’re happy we got to see him in Amazon’s original series, Jack Ryan, and flex his muscles as a director with A Quiet Place and now A Quiet Place Part II.

              "  'context': 'MARGINALIA You’ll Never Guess Who Walked In! Ardi redefines the branch between apes and hominins Pat Shipman The best thing about paleontology is the surprises. No matter how carefully you have analyzed the fossils, no matter how insightful your understanding of the links between anatomical form and function, Mother Nature always comes up with something totally unpredicted. Surprises certainly have been sprung by, and on, the international team of paleoanthropologists and paleontologists that looks for fossils in the remote Aramis region of Ethiopia where the Afar people live. The team is co-led by Berhane Asfaw of the Rift Valley Research Service in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Yonas Beyene of the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Culture in Ethiopia;the late J. Desmond Clark, formerly of the University of California, Berkeley; Giday Woldegabriel of the Los Alamos National Laboratory; and Tim White of the University of California, Berkeley. With a nice touch of delicacy, White refers to Clark as \"inspiring but no longer making decisions\" about the project. On October 2, 2009, the team published in Science their analyses of a hominin (member of the human lineage) called Ardipithecus ramidus. The best representative of the species is a partial female skeleton nicknamed Ardi; she is 4.4 million years old and is certainly astonishing and noteworthy. There are parts of at least 35 other individuals in the collection, in addition to thousands of specimens of plants, invertebrates, fish and assorted nonprimate mammals from the same location. Ardi is the oldest partial skeleton in the hominin lineage at present, but she doesn’t represent a new species. Ardipithecus ramidus has been known since the first research paper about it was published in Nature in 1994 under what might be considered an \"alias\": Australopithecus ramidus. The naming of Ardi has had some singular twists and turns. The genus into which the type specimen of Ardipithecus was initially classified was Australopithecus, meaning \"southern ape,\" a term created in 1925 by Raymond Dart to accommodate a face, jaw and endocast (a natural cast of the braincase) of a young juvenile hominin found in South Africa. The \"Taung baby,\" as it was nicknamed, was the oldest (about 2.5 million years) and first member of the human lineage to be found in Africa at that point. Skepticism from the scientific establishment at the time of discovery was rife. The hoaxed Piltdown skull, with its large brain (variously estimated between 1,000 and 1,500 cubic centimeters) and seeming antiquity, had been announced in 1911–12 and was still believed to be genuine. Thus the small brain (about 340 cubic centimeters) of the Taung baby was so unexpected that many anthropologists dismissed the fossil as merely an immature, if ancient, ape. Surely our large brain was a fundamental human characteristic extending back to the beginning of our lineage! \"Surely\"—but not in fact. More than 25 years passed before the anthropological community realized what Dart had recognized from his fossil: Our ancestors had humanlike teeth long before they had a large, humanlike brain. Instead of brain size being the fundamental adaptation that separated our earliest ancestors from the apes, it was our teeth and, later discoveries showed, our bipedal locomotion. How surprising—and disappointing to those who had prided themselves on their big brains. Since 1925, many different species of Australopithecus have been described and named, including Australopithecus afarensis, the species to which the famous partial skeleton Lucy belongs. All are bipedal hominins, although not necessarily directly ancestral to modern humans. Some apparently ate fruit, whereas others had a more fibrous diet. Some were larger, some smaller, and most species showed a striking difference in body size between males and females (a trait called sexual dimorphism). Some probably made stone tools. They lived in both East and South Africa and may have been more widely spread across the continent between 4.2 and 1.2 million years ago. You’ll Never Guess Who Walked In!',\n",

According to a new study, some people with the so-called \"dark triad\" personality traits -- like narcissism and psychopathy -- keep their exes around for strategic, self serving reasons. Previous research and expert analysis suggests that individuals with dark personality traits like psychopathy engage in behaviors and relationships that are beneficial for their personal gain. Researchers from Oakland University wanted see if this theory also applied to connections with former partners. In the first part of their study, the researchers asked more than 300 participants to name reasons why they would want to be friends with an ex. Then, they narrowed these reasons down to seven concrete categories, such as \"reliability/sentimentality,\" \"pragmatism,\" and \"sexual access.\" The researchers assigned high scores to positive categories (like a former partner was \"reliable, trustworthy and of sentimental value\"), and lower scores to more negative categories (practicality and sexual access). Then, for the second experiment, they gave the list of seven categories to approximately 500 new participants, and asked each of them to rank the categories in order of personal importance to them. These new participants were also given clinical assessments that measured their prevalence of dark personality traits. The results revealed, unsurprisingly, that highly ranking a practical reason for remaining friends with an ex predicted a clinical assessment of narcissism or psychopathy. The findings \"suggest that [a post-relationship friendship] may provide opportunity for ex-partners to exchange desirable resources (e.g., love, status, information, money, sex) after romantic relationship dissolution,\" the study authors wrote in their conclusion. Translation: Not everyone\\'s post-breakup intentions are pure -- particularly if they have dark personalities. It\\'s not a bad idea to proceed with caution when it comes to an ex. The findings offer some fascinating insight on human relationships, specifically when it comes to emotional turmoil. Experts say that maintaining a relationship after a falling out is difficult, especially because -- surprise! -- ulterior motives may be at play. \"[Exes] are less emotionally supportive, less helpful, less trusting, and less concerned about the other person’s happiness,\" Juliana Breines, a social experience researcher and postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis University, wrote in a Psychology Today blog. \"This is especially true, not surprisingly, for former partners who were dissatisfied with the romantic relationship, and in cases when the break-up was not mutual.\" That isn\\'t to say that all exes are terrible people only using you for their pleasure. It is very possible to have a cordial relationship with a former partner. The basic takeaway here is, if it doesn\\'t feel like a real friendship to you, or things ended badly, there could be a less-than-kosher reason your ex tries to maintain the connection.

A new feature on Delta Air Lines’ app allows passengers to track the whereabouts of their checked luggage on a map in real time. Delta says it’s the first airline to offer a bag-tracking map. The map captures data from new radio-frequency identification bag tags Delta rolled out earlier this year, which are secured to bags passengers check on domestic flights. The tags include a tiny chip, similar to the ones that are embedded into pets, that emit a signal that is then picked up by a scanner. Delta, which handles about 120 million bags a year, said the project cost $50 million. The chances an airline will lose your bag are quite slim. US airlines reported an average of three mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers in August, according to the Department of Transportation. Where the new bag tags come into play is by helping airlines quickly locate lost bags and get them to their correct destination.

FORBES has learned that Johnson, widely regarded as an internet troll, is helping to recommend candidates for government jobs with the incoming presidential administration. (Photo: Screenshot from YouTube.com.) By Ryan Mac and Matt Drange An internet troll, who was once called the most hated man on the internet and is banned from Twitter, is recommending candidates to serve in the Trump administration. Charles Chuck Johnson, a controversial blogger and conservative online personality, has been pushing for various political appointees to serve under Donald Trump, according to multiple sources close to the President-elect's transition team. While Johnson does not have a formal position, FORBES has learned that he is working behind the scenes with members of the transition team's executive committee, including billionaire Trump donor Peter Thiel, to recommend, vet and give something of a seal of approval to potential nominees from the so-called alt-right. The proximity to power is something new for Johnson, a self-described journalist, author and debunker of frauds, who has made a name for himself by peddling false information and right-wing conspiracy theories online. In the months leading up to the election, Johnson, 28, used social media and his website GotNews.com to stump for the President-elect while also publishing misinformation on Trump's detractors. Now, Johnson is helping to pick some of the leaders who may run the country for the next four years. FORBES verified Johnson's involvement with multiple people close to the transition team who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. When asked about his work with the transition team, Johnson said last month that he had no formal role, and was vague regarding his level of influence. Johnson agreed to multiple phone and email interviews with FORBES in December, but he declined to return repeated follow-up requests for comment this month. Whether I am listened to or not remains to be seen, Johnson wrote in an email to FORBES in December. I am by and large pretty happy with the government selected thus far, though I am sorry to say that a lot of the candidates that I favor have not been selected. Johnson's statements came before his appearance on an online radio show with libertarian blogger Stefan Molyneux on Dec. 22 during which Johnson declared that he had been doing a lot of vetting for the administration and the Trump transition. The disclosure of Johnson's involvement comes at a time of intense scrutiny for Trump's transition team, whose cabinet picks will begin Senate confirmation hearings this week. Those hearings are moving forward despite the fact that, as of this weekend, the Office of Government Ethics had not completed its review of multiple appointees. It is unprecedented for the Senate to hold confirmation hearings for a President-elect's nominees before formal background checks are completed. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not return a request for comment. Jeremiah Hall, a spokesman for Thiel, declined to comment. While Twitter banned Johnson in May 2015 after threatening a Black Lives Matters activist, he made a name for himself as an internet troll, or an online personality who antagonizes others by posting inflammatory or misleading information. Among his exploits, Johnson has published the home addresses of New York Times reporters, wrongly identified a woman he thought was the source of Rolling Stone's now-retracted story of an alleged rape at the University of Virginia and claimed that President Barack Obama is gay.  On Twitter, like, I have a certain kind of personality, a pugnaciousness, like an alter ego, he said in 2014 to Mother Jones. You know, like when Spider-Man puts on the costume, for instance, he's no longer a mild-mannered photographer. He has an attitude. I do that because I want my content to really go viral. Johnson portrays GotNews as an alternative to the lying mainstream media. He said it receives 2.5 million page views per month. (Quantcast estimated in the last 30 days that about 246,000 people have visited the site.) Recent stories include a piece on Senator Ted Cruz's supposedly imminent Supreme Court nomination and another on Trump's biggest regret in supporting John McCain's 2016 Senate re-election run.  Despite his disregard for facts and reckless approach to publishing, Johnson, who was recently photographed at a dinner attended by white supremacists in Washington, D.C., built a significant following among many who self-identified as being a part of the alt-right. Trump drew significant support from those same followers during the election.  Mike Cernovich, another pro-Trump troll who is friends with Johnson, said that Johnson often has a hand in behind-the-scenes politics. The media really likes to hate on , Cernovich said. But if they knew how influential he has been--in ways they didn't know--it would be kind of mind blowing. Johnson, who boldly predicted against conventional wisdom and polls that Trump would win, and who was spotted in the VIP section at Trump's election night party, began working with the transition team shortly after Nov. 8. Among his contacts within Manhattan's Trump Tower, where the President-elect has set up camp, is Thiel, a member of the transition's executive committee. A PayPal cofounder and Facebook board member whose vast network of Silicon Valley connections has made him invaluable to the President-elect, Thiel has overseen many of the science and technology appointments for the incoming administration. Johnson has helped in that effort, pushing for at least a dozen potential candidates to Thiel, including Ajit Pai, a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission, whom Johnson hopes will lead the organization under Trump. Pai declined to comment for this story. As a Republican member of the FCC, Pai is a natural candidate to be considered for the chairmanship of the agency, and Johnson's recommendation suggests he's also favored by a segment of the self-described alt-right.  Beyond recommending candidates, Johnson has also helped set up meetings between potential appointees and transition team members. He has worked with Jim O'Neill, who is being considered to head the Food and Drug Administration and is currently employed by Thiel at San Francisco-based investment firm Mithril Capital. Johnson has tried to arrange for O'Neill to meet with conservative influencers and political groups in an effort to build support for his potential FDA nomination. O'Neill declined to comment. Johnson also helped create a database where potential political appointees could send in their resumes to be considered for government positions. He has access to the website ThePlumlist.com, and though the recently created website remains dormant, candidates have been told to send their information to an email account associated with that domain. In November, The Daily Mail reported that Thiel maintains a database called the Plum List to track potential hires and qualified applicants. Sources familiar with the situation described the list as an intake system for the team, and said it was separate from the version that Thiel and his closest associates use to track final selections that are forwarded to Trump. Johnson denied working with Thiel, and said the two had only a passing familiarity. Johnson added that he and Thiel share some of the same enemies, a reference to the now defunct news organization, Gawker Media. Thiel secretly bankrolled former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan's landmark invasion of privacy lawsuit against the New York media organization, which ultimately led to the company's bankruptcy. Separately, Johnson sued Gawker in a California court for defamation after the website published a series of critical and abrasive stories about him. FORBES previously reported that Johnson, while exploring representation for his case, had a phone discussion with lawyers at Harder Mirell & Abrams, the law firm that Thiel paid to represent Hogan, and that Johnson's case had been pitched to other Los Angeles law firms as part of a wider legal strategy against Gawker. Johnson's lawsuit remains on hold, pending a hearing later this month in federal bankruptcy court to determine the fate of Gawker Media's remaining assets. If Gawker is Johnson and Thiel's shared enemy, then Trump advisor and chief strategist Stephen Bannon is their most prominent mutual ally. Johnson worked for Bannon at Breitbart News, where Bannon served as executive chairman before joining Trump's campaign last year. I liked , and was close to him, Johnson said in a December phone interview. Last fall, Johnson and Bannon led an effort prior to the second presidential debate in October to stage a press conference with Trump and four women who have accused Bill Clinton of rape, sexual assault or sexual harassment and Hillary Clinton of protecting an alleged sexual criminal. Johnson claimed to have helped raise more than $10,000 for one of those women, Kathleen Shelton--who alleged that she was raped in 1975 by a man who Hillary Clinton later represented as a public defender--to attend the event. While Johnson denied his recent work with Thiel, he freely discussed his efforts to influence the transition team through his old boss, Bannon. Still, Johnson insisted that while Bannon takes his opinion into consideration, his recommendations are sometimes ignored. Imagine you had an ex-boss who became the consigliere to the President of the United States, Johnson told FORBES last month. You can't be like, 'Dude, you're f***ing up.'  Alexandra Preate, a spokesperson for Bannon, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The full extent of Johnson's involvement in the transition is not clear, though several of his associates have also interfaced with the team in recent weeks. FORBES has learned that Cernovich and Jeff Giesea, a Washington, D.C.-based entrepreneur who worked for Thiel in the past, have also been in contact with transition team members, according to sources. Giesea declined to comment, while Cernovich discussed the transition team's agenda but remained vague when pressed for details of his own work.  I want to be free to say whatever I want to say. And in a way that limits what I can do officially, Cernovich said, denying that he has had any direct communication with Thiel or other members of the transition team. I don't want anyone to get jammed up, vis-&agrave;-vis any association with me. Cernovich and Giesea have also organized a party for Trump supporters in Washington, D.C. later this month dubbed the DeploraBall. Cernovich said that 1,000 tickets have been sold for the event, which is billed as the biggest meme ever and will take place at the National Press Club on the eve of Trump's inauguration. Johnson said the event was about giving voice to a group of people who, until Trump's landmark victory in November, were often ignored by the political establishment. When asked if he felt that he had gotten credit for his recent work, Johnson said, Not as much as I deserve. Johnson attributed much of the work that he and others have done in support of Trump to being able to tap into voters' emotions through memes, such as the Pepe the Frog cartoon that became an informal mascot for Trump supporters. Johnson said that memes represent a new way for people to discuss national politics, which he said is dominated by a white paper mindset predicated on debating policy merits based on fact rather than emotion. To hear Johnson tell it, the success of this approach is evidenced by the visceral reaction to memes that generated widespread attention and influenced public perception during Trump's rise to power, despite having little or no basis in fact. The election was won by a bunch of people making memes, Johnson proclaimed. We memed the President into existence. A Troll Outside Trump Tower Is Helping To Pick Your Next Government\",\n",

              "  'context': 'Two students from the University of Hawaii at Hilo are suing the school, claiming their constitutional rights were violated when they were barred from handing out copies of the United States Constitution. In a federal lawsuit filed Thursday, Merritt Burch and Anthony Vizzone claim their First Amendment right to free speech was infringed upon during a January event where school officials stopped them as they passed out copies of the Constitution, according to Fox News. Burch and Vizzone, who were there to represent the campus’ chapter of Young Americans for Liberty, were told that campus policy dictates members of clubs and organizations are not allowed to approach fellow students and solicit them. The complaint also states that the university \"unconstitutionally restricts access to open areas on campus by requiring students to seek permission to speak at least seven business days in advance.\" Without getting prior permission, students who wish to exercise their freedom are relegated to a small \"free speech zone\" on the edge of campus, which the students’ lawyers say is not particularly accessible or in a high-traffic area. Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which is assisting in the lawsuit, went so far as to call the undesirable zone a \"censorship swamp.\" \"The First Amendment is not optional at public colleges -- it’s the law,\" Lukianoff said in a statement. \"Enforcing restrictive ‘free speech zone’ policies that prevent students from passing out copies of the Constitution is impossible to justify.\" According to the plaintiffs’ attorney, Bob Corn-Revere, \"Part of the paradox is the idea that on a state campus, the exercise of constitutional rights can be confined to a zone, to one-quarter of 1 percent of the campus.\" The University of Hawaii issued a statement saying it has begun \"a review of the policies involved and the manner in which they were enforced.\" It also noted the university \"is committed to free expression and the open exchange of ideas.\" Despite the lawsuit, the chapter of Young Americans for Liberty doesn\\'t appear to be hampered by the campus policies. Burch, who is the chapter’s president, published a blog post on the Young Americans for Liberty website the same day the lawsuit was filed, boasting the success of an April 17 event on U.S. national debt. The post specifically points out how the event raised the organization’s profile to students on campus and the surrounding community. \"We attracted the attention of hundreds of students and managed to get almost 40 new signups for our club,\" wrote Burch. She added their event also made the local newspaper’s front page. Burch and Vizzone\\'s lawsuit repeats a similar situation at another American campus. In February, the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, which is also representing the Hawaii students, helped a California college student win a $50,000 settlement after he was stopped from handing out copies of the Constitution.

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia—Joudi al-Omeri drove in circles. And when cars came in her direction, she swerved. These were electric bumper cars, but in Saudi Arabia, the ride doesn’t always live up to its name. \"I come here to drive,\" said Ms. al-Omeri, a 27-year-old homemaker still giddy from the roughly five-minute, mostly crash-free ride in her red-and-green two-seater. \"It’s much better than bumping against others,\" she adds. At the weekly ladies-only night at the Al Shallal Theme Park in the coastal city of Jeddah, women discard head scarves and head-to-toe black gowns to reveal the latest trends—ripped jeans, tank tops, and tossed-to-the-side ’80s-style hair. For many of them, the biggest draw of the amusement park isn’t the few hours of fashion freedom. Instead, they go there to get behind the wheel—even a bumper-car wheel—in a country that bans female drivers. There are no loud bangs or ferocious head-on crashes. There are a few slow-speed collisions, but also a lot of dodging, as many women are content with just gliding over the smooth surface. For some, the biggest risk of bumping into each other is while taking a selfie. \"They love driving the cars,\" Aman al-Abadi, the ride attendant, said of the women who were getting back in line for another spin. \"Men are always bumping.\" With the exception of remote corners of the desert kingdom—where Bedouin women sometimes get behind the wheel—the amusement park offers a rare, hassle-free environment for women to hone their driving skills. That is partly why, on ladies nights, there is a winding queue at the bumper cars. Outside the theme park, activists, writers and even some politicians now are pushing to lift the ban on driving actual cars. One of the strongest cases proponents make is financial: Many women, even those with jobs, simply can’t afford a driver. In this conservative society, there are many who resist it, warning that allowing women to move freely without a male guardian would expose them to social evils and personal trouble. Among them is Mohammed Bayea, who on mixed-gender evening at the amusement park was happily driving alongside several women on the crowded bumper-car platform. There was the occasional knock, but for the most part men and women steered clear of each other. The women wore traditional dress. \"It’s OK if they drive here,\" said Mr. Bayea, a Riyadh native who was on vacation in Jeddah. But he said he wouldn’t want them driving in the real world. \"I am a nice guy, I don’t flirt with women. But other men will.\" The driving ban has helped lead to the flourishing of ride-hailing apps by companies like Uber Technologies Inc., which recently announced it received a $3.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund ENLARGE A theme park in Jeddah holds a women-only night. Photo: Margherita Stancati/The Wall Street Journal . While women at Saudi Arabia’s amusement parks often seek a driving experience that mirrors crash-avoidance reality, men relish bashing into each other. When they take to the bumper cars, their goal—like pretty much everywhere else in the world—is to gather speed for maximum impact. When it comes time for the women to drive in a mixed-gender theme park in the town of Abha, a big black curtain goes up around the bumper car platform to shield the female drivers from outside view. The cars resume driving in circles and the platform becomes placid again. Some women have unwittingly breached the no-bumping etiquette. When, for the first time in years, Arwa al-Neami went on the bumper cars in the theme park in Abha, she decided to chase the other female drivers. She got a lot of angry shouting in return. \"They would scream: ‘Please, don’t bump me! I am trying to drive!’ \" says Ms. al-Neami, a Jeddah-based artist who began documenting the phenomenon in 2014 as part of an art project called Never Never Land. Some women viewed the bumper car for what it was: Amusement. \"It’s just a game,\" said Darin Twergi, a student, with a shrug. \"It’s not that big a deal if I drive or not.\" Others regard time spent in a brightly colored open-top vehicle with a hot rod attached to the ceiling as a serious practice session. Before she moved abroad for university, Sama bin Mahfooz said she would go to the theme park in Jeddah especially to drive. \"We never get a chance to in Saudi Arabia—this is the right place to do it,\" says Ms. bin Mahfooz, 20. \"Whenever my best friend would hit me, I would tell her: ‘No, let me drive, let me drive!’ \" Her wealthier friends were less interested. They would say \"we have drivers, we don’t need to do that,\" she recalls. In a country where only 23% of Saudi women have jobs, ladies-only nights bring women out in force. Every employee is in fact a woman, from the popcorn sellers to the security guards to the bumper car attendant. The men have the night off. And while cinemas are normally banned, there are two of them in Al Shallal alone. Granted, the movies last under five minutes, and the experience is really just about the special effects: 3-D screens, seats that jolt and sprays of water. For many women, the biggest attraction of ladies nights is simply a man-free world. One woman says she goes every week, ostensibly to accompany her teenage daughters. \"The girls can wear what they want and roam around freely,\" said Nadia Shamsaan, 33. \"But I also come here to relax,\" she added, sprawled on an outdoor sofa in a patterned shirt and jeans. Outside the park, reality hits. The women step out in their all-covering abayas to find a tangle of traffic that snarls around its perimeter. The men have come to pick them up. Many of the female bumper car drivers confide they would like to sit on the driver’s seat outside the park’s high walls, too. Some of them say, secretly, they already have. Ms. al-Omeri, the homemaker, says with pride: \"I’ve driven in the desert.\" Saudi Arabian Women Love Bumper Cars (But Not for Bumping)',\n",

Dispensary owners say they\\'re facing delays that could prevent a vast majority of shops from being able to sell retail marijuana to adults 21-and-over come the new year. \"It has been very frustrating from a multitude of angles working with Denver City and County, the various departments within the government,\" Toni Fox, owner of 3D Cannabis Center in Denver, told The Huffington Post. \"Right now what’s happening is there are a few of us that have had all of our T\\'s crossed and I’s dotted since day one and we’re ready, but there’s just this delay.\" Fox, whose application has received approval for recreational marijuana sales, said she has been trying to get an inspection for about two weeks, but finally got the appointment set up on Monday. \"There’s a sense of frustration and a feeling amongst industry people that we have an adversary city government trying to implement a program that they don’t want,\" she added. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock\\'s spokeswoman Amber Miller told The Denver Post that the inspection cards are issued immediately after a positive hearing result and the city departments \"promptly implemented the new regulatory system -- concurrent with the state system -- after the ordinance was passed mid-September.\" But Fox remains skeptical of Mayor Hancock\\'s intent for the pot shops. Hancock has been a vocal opponent of both marijuana legalization and Amendment 64, which voters passed in November 2012 and makes recreational marijuana legal to sell and possess in the state. \"He’s never been a supporter of the industry from day one,\" Fox said. \"I feel like we’re fighting against a city government that doesn’t want us even though the constituents have voted us in. It’s very frustrating.\" When asked by The Denver Post if Hancock \"hated\" the idea of marijuana legalization in the state, Hancock replied with a flat-out \"yes.\" \"I have seen the devastation of the progression of marijuana to harsher drugs like crack cocaine,\" he added. \"And a lot of the folks that have dealt with substance abuse -- particularly with cocaine and crack cocaine -- they started with marijuana.\" Mason Tvert, communications director for Marijuana Policy Project and key backer of the Amendment 64 campaign in Colorado, told HuffPost that Hancock\\'s personal stance shouldn\\'t matter. \"It\\'s Mayor Hancock\\'s responsibility to ensure the implementation is carried out effectively and efficiently, so it is a little shocking that he is still addressing questions about it with diatribes against marijuana and claims that regulating it will somehow lead to increased crack use,\" he said. Tvert added that many city and state officials are working hard to get the marijuana retail system up and running on time, but some lawmakers do appear to be dragging their feet. \"All of the forthcoming marijuana retail stores are currently operating as medical marijuana businesses in good standing,\" he said. \"The law allows for them to open their doors on January 1, and there is no logical reason why they should not be allowed to do so.\" The process to obtain a recreational marijuana license in Colorado is extraordinarily rigorous. Only existing medical marijuana dispensaries in \"good standing\" with the state are able to apply, and shop owners must then be approved by both state and local jurisdictions. Once approved, proprietors gave a public hearing in which they must demonstrate that the proper regulatory controls are in place and that their business doesn\\'t make the neighborhood less safe. Once the hearing is finished and pending approval from the judge, city officials must inspect the premises. All said and done, retail pot shops must obtain a state license, a city license and pass five city inspections. The hearings for the marijuana businesses were supposed to begin in early November, but were delayed for nearly two weeks. \"It has been very smooth in terms of the process,\" Andy Williams, owner of Denver\\'s Medicine Man dispensary, said to HuffPost. \"But the hearings are the tough point. They started late. They were supposed to start in early November, but didn’t start until mid-November. They only do two hearings a day.\" Williams said his shop got through the process very quickly, and he\\'s picking up his inspection card Monday. \"I have no doubt that we will be done with the process and open on January 1,\" Williams said. \"But there will be a lot of people that won’t because they aren’t going to get through the hearing process. And getting inspections from the city in December is a troublesome thing.\" Calls to the city regulatory departments regarding the perceived delays in the approval process were not immediately returned.

Egg freezing ( Egg freezing ( costly ) and in vitro fertilization ( also, costly ) have expanded options for women who wish to mother children in the future. But many still experience \" baby panic \": the fear of missing out on motherhood because of declining fertility as they age. Women still face social pressure to have children, as well as time restraints because of their biology, neither of which affect men to the same degree. Fertility declines in men much later than for women. \"Though not as abrupt or noticeable as the changes in women, changes in fertility and sexual functioning do occur in men as they grow older. Despite these changes, there is no maximum age at which a man cannot father a child, as evidenced by men in their 60s and 70s conceiving with younger partners.\" For women, it\\'s a different story.

              "  'context': 'NEW YORK -- For more than two years, Lance Crowder was having severe abdominal pain and vomiting, and no local doctor could figure out why. Finally, an emergency room physician in Indianapolis had an idea. \"The first question he asked was if I was taking hot showers to find relief. When he asked me that question, I basically fell into tears because I knew he had an answer,\" Crowder said. The answer was cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS. It’s caused by heavy, long-term use of various forms of marijuana. For unclear reasons, the nausea and vomiting are relieved by hot showers or baths. \"They’ll often present to the emergency department three, four, five different times before we can sort this out,\" said Dr. Kennon Heard, an emergency room physician at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, Colorado. He co-authored a study showing that since 2009, when medical marijuana became widely available, emergency room visits diagnoses for CHS in two Colorado hospitals nearly doubled. In 2012, the state legalized recreational marijuana. \"It is certainly something that, before legalization, we almost never saw,\" Heard said. \"Now we are seeing it quite frequently.\" Outside of Colorado, when patients do end up in an emergency room, the diagnosis is often missed. Partly because doctors don’t know about CHS, and partly because patients don’t want to admit to using a substance that’s illegal. California overwhelmingly passed a measure to legalize marijuana for recreational use Tuesday. Similar measures passed in three other states, but... CHS can lead to dehydration and kidney failure, but usually resolves within days of stopping drug use. That’s what happened with Crowder, who has been off all forms of marijuana for seven months. \"Now all kinds of ambition has come back. I desire so much more in life and, at 37 years old, it’s a little late to do it, but better now than never,\"he said. CHS has only been recognized for about the past decade, and nobody knows exactly how many people suffer from it. But as more states move towards the legalization of marijuana, emergency room physicians like Dr. Heard are eager to make sure both doctors and patients have CHS on their radar.

Resistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report’s authors warn. Drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called ‘superbugs’ such as MRSA develop.

In the UK, 45 per cent of all antibiotics are given to livestock. The report is the result of a two year long review of the use of antibiotics undertaken by economist and former Goldman Sachs Asset Managemet chairman Lord Jim O’Neill. The review was commissioned by the Government amid growing concerns about the use of the medicines in the UK. Lord O\\'Neill said tackling antimicrobial resistance is \\'absolutely essential\\' (PA) It calls for urgent action to halt the growing use of antibiotics: \"to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world would otherwise face.\" Among his recommendations, Lord O’Neill calls for a public awareness campaign on the harms of antibiotic use, for restrictions to be placed on the use of some critical antibiotics and a tax on the drugs to be introduced for livestock use.

What’s more, then and there, despite having no experience of rearing animals, he vowed to nurse the poor baby back to health. This took place in 2013 on the sizzling streets of Tampa. Longo, a Florida native, thought that the little thing didn’t look good, and he knew that the unrelenting sunshine was taking its toll. Indeed, Longo later recounted how the helpless baby was \"half-dead\" when they first met. And so, despite having no clue even as to what the animal was, he decided to take it back to his home in St. Petersburg. Consequently, Longo christened the critter Biscuits and began to hand-rear her himself. Clearly, then, the first order of the day was to give the adorable and tiny creature, which was just over an inch in length, some major TLC. However, without an inkling of even which species Biscuits belonged to, Longo didn’t have the first idea about how best to raise her. So, this being the 21st century and all, he began to research his new-found friend online. First, Longo went to Reddit to ask the website’s online community for help. However, most of the responses were from people telling him, simply, that there was no way he’d manage to raise Biscuits on his own. Undeterred, though, Longo continued his research and eventually discovered the answer he was looking for. It turned out that he was going to be looking after a southern flying squirrel. Naturally, this species of squirrel usually resides in forests and woods, using trees as their habitat. They furthermore survive on a diet of nuts, seeds, fruit and insects as well as eggs and birds. The gliding rodents are nocturnal, and young squirrels tend to stay with their mothers until they are at least two months old. Since Biscuits had somehow become separated from her family, then, it was now down to Longo to fill her mother’s shoes. So, for two months, Longo took Biscuits everywhere with him – even to work. He even bottle-fed her with a mix of puppy formula and heavy cream. As each day passed, Biscuits grew bigger and stronger, until she eventually became a healthy adult squirrel. In addition to getting the gift of life, though, Biscuits had also, again thanks to her encounter with Longo, gained a new family. Indeed, alongside her surrogate mother, Biscuits gained some four-legged family friends – in the shape of Longo’s dogs. That said, given their difference in stature, Longo admitted that he had to \"watch them so they don’t accidentally squish her.\" He Rescued This Bizarre Creature From a Sidewalk, But He Had No Idea What It Would Grow Into',\n",

A new report from The Wrap, however, shows that this film could be even bigger for Zendaya than we first thought. If you don’t want to know who she’ll be portraying, now is the time to turn away. Writes the website, \"Zendaya will be playing long-time Spider-Man love interest Mary Jane Watson,\" stating that \"two individuals with knowledge of the project\" told them of the news. \"At least one recent draft of the script has Zendaya’s character dropping several clues to her identity as Mary Jane,\" The Wrap continues. Sony declined to comment, whereas Marvel and Zendaya’s representatives have not yet responded to the report. Films, and especially high profile superhero blockbusters, often use fake names for important characters in order to maintain as much secrecy as possible. Mary Jane Watson is an iconic character in the Spider-Man universe, so it’s no wonder they were trying to keep her under wraps for as long as possible. With the addition of the character’s actual name to the script, either Sony are ready to start spreading the news that Zendaya is playing MJ, or the wrong people were trusted with that version of the script.

              "  'context': 'Those of us who spend our lives helping people with their relationships talk a lot about behaviors. We encourage couples to say this instead of that and to act in this way instead of in that way. We also talk a lot about emotions – how to manage them and express them in constructive ways. While behaviors and emotions matter in relationships, the emphasis we put on them forces one of our central human attributes onto the back burner: our thoughts. What role do our thoughts and beliefs play in the success or failure of our relationships? As it turns out, one common thought pattern is highly toxic for relationships. You can view it as a core belief or as a mental stance... but I prefer to think of it as a cognitive trap. The trap is this: you believe that there is only one true reality. You believe in finding The Truth with a capital \"T\" and anyone who doesn’t buy into the truth you’ve uncovered is objectively wrong. Simply put, when your mind can’t accept and validate multiple realities, your relationships will suffer. Some common relationship maxims hint at the shortcomings of this belief. For example, \"There are three sides to every story: your side, my side, and the truth.\" This simple truism highlights an understanding that my truth is not The Truth . You’ve also likely heard someone say, \"You can be right or you can be happy.\" This saying points toward the fact that believing your reality is The Reality compels you to convince others – sometimes aggressively – that your reality is right. In the process, you’ll invalidate the other person’s reality, drive them away, and find yourself feeling less and less happy. Let’s look at 3 specific ways the \"single reality\" mindset is undermining your relationships: 1. It makes your partner a second-class citizen. When you believe that there is only one reality – and you’re the one pursuing it – you’ve put yourself in a (self-appointed) position of superiority. You’re basically saying that you hold the key to objective reality and your partner doesn’t. That doesn’t sound like a very fair arrangement, does it? Whether you intend it or not, holding this belief creates a relationship where your partner is a second-class citizen. It throws the idea of an equal partnership out the window. Even worse, taking a stance of superiority fosters feelings of contempt toward others... and according to renowned marriage researcher John Gottman , the presence of contempt in a marriage is the single biggest predictor of divorce. 2. It makes disagreements unresolvable. Believing that you – and you alone – have access to The Truth undercuts your partner’s right to have their opinion respected. But respecting each other’s opinions is a pre-requisite for successfully resolving disagreements. These two ideas, taken together, illustrate how holding the \"single reality\" mindset makes disputes unresolvable. To successfully resolve disputes, both sides need to have their realities acknowledged and validated by the other. You can fully understand another person’s perspective on something and still disagree. In fact, this is likely the healthiest way to disagree. But without understanding the other person’s perspective first – because you cannot tolerate alternate perspectives – you are left with less healthy ways to disagree. These include steamrolling, badgering, and manipulating... all of which undermine the stability of the relationship. 3. It’s antagonistic. This cognitive trap – believing that there is only one true reality – is profoundly divisive. It sets up a dynamic where you feel compelled to convince the other person of your perspective, not only because you want to \"win\" the fight, but because you want to save them from their \"delusional\" ideas. In other words, when you feel the need to \"convert\" someone to what you believe to be The Truth, you’re driving a wedge between you and them. You’re creating \"otherness.\" And what comes from \"otherness\"? Antagonism. While it’s never easy to change a core belief, you certainly can get better at accepting and validating multiple realities. The first step is to replace the belief that there is only one true reality with a slightly modified one. This new belief would be: \"I am the ultimate authority over my own reality.\" This new belief will serve you better in a few ways. First, it allows you to retain power and authority in the relationship – which you deserve to have – just in a narrower context. Second, it gives power and authority to the other person as well, allowing for balanced and productive interactions. Only when both partners have power in the relationship can it finally be the harmonious union you’ve always dreamed of. Pull yourself out of this cognitive trap and start down the road towards better relating! This Is the 1 Thing Ruining Your Relationship',\n",

              "  'context': 'Tranexamic acid could save the lives of a third of women who die in childbirth from excessive bleeding, which kills 100,000 a year A cheap and widely available drug could save the lives of thousands of women who die in childbirth from excessive bleeding, one of the main killers of women worldwide. The drug, tranexamic acid, is available over the counter in the UK to women suffering from heavy periods. In Japan and the far east, it is used as a skin whitener. But now a very large study of 20,000 women in 21 countries has shown it can stop a third of cases of bleeding to death after giving birth. Haemorrhage after childbirth kills 100,000 women a year, mostly in low and middle-income countries. \"It is not only the women dying – it is the impact on the child that has to grow up without a mother, children who might already be in the family and the husband,\" said associate professor Haleema Shakur from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who led the trial. \"This is of absolutely huge importance. While a single mother is dying, we need to keep fighting for them.\" The drug has already been proven to cut the death toll from bleeding after accidents in a trial of similar size. The latest trial, published in the Lancet medical journal, recruited more than 20,000 women who either gave birth in one of 193 hospitals involved or managed to get there after starting to bleed. They were randomly assigned either tranexamic acid or a placebo. The researchers found that tranexamic acid was most effective when it was given soon after the bleeding began. The trial was originally intended also to find out whether the drug saved women from having to undergo a hysterectomy – the removal of the womb. But the scientists discovered that in many countries, where anaemia is common and blood supplies are limited, surgeons operated immediately as the surest way to save the woman’s life. If all women who haemorrhage after childbirth were given the drug, the trial suggests that 30,000 lives could be saved a year. In practice, that will be more difficult. Tranexamic acid was given in an intravenous injection in the hospitals, as the quickest way to have an effect. Many women give birth at home and may not get to a hospital in time. \"It is available in the form of a tablet for heavy periods, but absorption may take too long,\" said Shakur. They are now working on new ways to get it rapidly into women’s systems – perhaps as an injection in the arm muscle or as a capsule under the tongue. It is also possible that women deemed to be at high risk of haemorrhage could be given a tablet before they give birth. The trials have shown no side-effects, making the drug very safe. Of the two-thirds of women who died in spite of being given the drug, Shakur said some arrived at hospital too late, while others had underlying illness including severe malaria and anaemia which may have been the cause of death. It has taken a long time to show that the drug does work in the context it was designed for. Professor Ian Roberts from the London School, who co-led the study, said: \"The researchers who invented tranexamic acid more than 50 years ago hoped it would reduce deaths from postpartum haemorrhage, but they couldn’t persuade obstetricians at the time to conduct a trial. Now we finally have these results that we hope can help save women’s lives around the world.\" There are many next steps, said Shakur. \"We have to make sure tranexamic acid is available wherever a woman gives birth and is at risk,\" she said. \"We must make sure doctors and midwives are aware of the results of the study. And we need health ministers to make sure that the drug is available in their country and is on their shopping list of essential medicines.\" Cheap, widely available drug could stop thousands of mothers bleeding to death',\n",

              "  'context': 'Before I owned a straightener, I would get down on the floor and drape my long hair over my ironing board and beg my friends to iron out my waves. Then, when I turned 14, I bought a very cheap straightener that fried my strands and made them extremely frizzy. When I turned 15, I bought another straightener that was so small, it would take me hours to make my thick hair stick straight. Finally, when I turned 16, I bit the bullet, invested in a $200 hair straightener and never looked back -- or had to buy another one since. Suffice it to say, I\\'m a bit of an expert on the subject. Over the years, I\\'ve moved away from pin straight locks and I\\'ve come to perfect the \"straight-hair-that-doesn\\'t-look-straightened\" \\'do. Unbeknownst to many of my friends and co-workers, I use my straightener at least once or twice a week to achieve the slightly-straight but still slightly-wavy bed head look I love. So when I was presented with a new straightener to try, the Ferrum Professional Styler by Ladies & Gents, I was hesitant, to say the least. After all, I hadn\\'t tried a new hot tool in years. Ladies & Gents Ferrum Professional Styler, $180, Ferrumiron.com What did excite me about the Ferrum Professional Styler was the fact that it was marketed as a straightener that didn\\'t make your hair stick straight, rather it gave you \"healthy, shiny hair with Blow-Out volume.\" It does so with special clamps: While one side is made of the typical ceramic, the other side has a fabric surface. When I first tried the straightener, I immediately loved the adjustable heat setting. It spans from 140 to 450 degrees, which is great for my coarse hair. Though it took a while to heat up, it did get very hot. But it took me a little longer than usual to straighten my hair because of the fabric half of the straightener, plus the fact that the entire tool was rather thin. While the fabric surface is supposed to limit the damage to your hair, it ultimately is a bit of a time suck. The Ferrum Styler did exactly what it promised: It straightened my hair, but gave it volume. It looked like it was professionally done, which isn\\'t my taste, though I can acknowledge that many people, working women especially, would love the outcome. Rating: 4 out of 5. The straightener was a tad on the thin side, so it took me a while to straighten my extremely thick hair. I also wasn\\'t wild about how \"done\" it ended up looking. That said, the Ferrum Styler got extremely hot and the next day my hair looked perfectly imperfect, just how I like it.

              "  'context': 'TEL AVIV – Mike Morell, the former acting director of the CIA, is generating headlines for claiming that alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election amounts to \"the political equivalent of 9/11.\" Morell further suggested that the U.S. should respond in a significant way to the alleged Russian actions and he has given interviews supporting reports that the CIA believes Russia tried to influence the election in favor of President-elect Donald Trump. Absent from the news media coverage of Morell’s statements is that he is known for his leading role in helping to craft the infamously misleading talking points used by Obama administration officials to blame the September 11, 2012 Benghazi attacks on a YouTube video. The news media also failed to mention that Morell, who abruptly resigned from the CIA in June 2013, took a job that year at the Beacon Global Strategies firm, where he still works as senior counselor. Beacon was founded by Phillippe Reines, who served as Communications Adviser to Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state. From 2009-2013, Reines also served in Clinton’s State Department as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Strategic Communications.  Reines is the managing director of Beacon. In an interview on Sunday with the Cipher Brief, Morell commented on reports in the Washington Post and New York Times claiming Moscow interfered in the presidential election to help Trump win – a contention the President-elect called \"ridiculous\" in an interview on Sunday. \"It is an attack on our very democracy,\" Morell said. \"It’s an attack on who we are as a people. A foreign government messing around in our elections is, I think, an existential threat to our way of life. To me, and this is to me not an overstatement, this is the political equivalent of 9/11. It is huge and the fact that it hasn’t gotten more attention from the Obama administration, Congress, and the mainstream media, is just shocking to me.\" Morell further asserted that the U.S. must respond overtly to the attack: He stated: The third implication is we need to respond to the Russian attack. We need to deter the Russians and anyone else who is watching this—and you can bet your bottom dollar that the Chinese, the North Koreans, the Iranians are all watching. We need to deter all of those folks from even thinking about doing something like this in the future. I think that our response needs to have two key pieces to it. One is it’s got to be overt. It needs to be seen. A covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect. If you can’t see it, it’s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others, so it’s got to be seen. The second is that it’s got to be significant from Putin’s perspective. He has to feel some pain, he has to pay a price here or, again, there will be no deterrence, and it has to be seen by the rest of the world as being significant to Mr. Putin so that it can be a deterrent. The interview with Morell was widely cited by the news media. \"Former Acting CIA Director Calls Russian Interference In Election ‘The Political Equivalent Of 9/11,’\" reads a Huffington Post headline. Business Insider ran a piece similarly titled, \"Former acting CIA Director Michael Morell: Russian meddling in US election ‘is the political equivalent of 9/11.’\" \"Ex-CIA Director: Obama Should Retaliate To Russian Election Hacks Now,\" blasted a Forbes.com headline. Morell’s quotes were cited by USA Today, the Independent and scores of other publications. Morell also appeared Monday on \"CBS This Morning,\" where he supported a CBS News report citing intelligence sources saying the CIA has high confidence that the Russians attempted to influence the presidential election in favor of Trump. \"The C.I.A. doesn’t come to a high-confidence judgment just based on circumstantial evidence. So I think they’ve got more here,\" Morell told the news network. \"I think they’ve got sources who are actually telling them what the intent was.\" The breathless news media coverage of Morell’s recent remarks, reviewed by this reporter, fails to mention Morell’s employment at the firm tied to Hillary Clinton. The coverage of Morell’s remarks also fails to take note of his central role in crafting misleading talking points on the Benghazi attacks. The talking points were used by United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice on Sunday, Sept. 16, 2012, when she appeared on five morning television programs to discuss the White House response to the Benghazi attacks. In nearly identical statements, she asserted that the attacks were a spontaneous protest in response to a \"hateful video.\" Morell addressed his role in editing the talking points during Benghazi testimony on April 4, 2014. The Guardian reported: In his testimony, Morell said he was deeply troubled by allegations made by lawmakers and some in the media \"that I inappropriately altered and influenced CIA’s classified analysis and its unclassified talking points about what happened in Benghazi, Libya in September 2012 and that I covered up those actions.\" \"These allegations accuse me of taking these actions for the political benefit of President Obama and then secretary of state Clinton. These allegations are false,\" Morell said. He said he and the agency could have done a better job, but he dismissed suggestions that the CIA \"cooked the books\" in the assessment of the attack. In a briefing to senators following the attacks, Morell claimed that references to terrorism and al-Qaeda were removed from the Benghazi talking points to \"prevent compromising an ongoing criminal investigation.\" Morell’s assertions were contradicted by a 46-page House Republican report from April 2013 finding the talking points were edited to protect the State Department’s reputation. \"Contrary to administration rhetoric, the talking points were not edited to protect classified information,\" states the \"Interim Progress Report for the Members of the House Republican Conference on the Events Surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 Terrorist Attacks in Benghazi.\" \"Evidence rebuts administration claims that the talking points were modified to protect classified information or to protect an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),\" the report states, charging the talking points were \"deliberately\" edited to \"protect the State Department.\" States the report: \"To protect the State Department, the administration deliberately removed references to al-Qaeda-linked groups and previous attacks in Benghazi in the talking points used by [United Nations] Ambassador [Susan] Rice, thereby perpetuating the deliberately misleading and incomplete narrative that the attacks evolved from a demonstration caused by a YouTube video.\" Morell resigned from the CIA amid the controversy surrounding the Benghazi attacks, saying he was stepping down to spend more time with his family. Morell, who was considered a favorite to lead the CIA and spent 33 years with the agency, acknowledged in his resignation statement that the reason for his leaving the agency may seem somewhat difficult to believe, but \"when I say that it is time for my family, nothing could be more real than that.\" \"I am passionate about two things in this world – the agency and my family,\" Morell said in the statement. \"And while I have given everything I have to the Central Intelligence Agency and its vital mission for a third of a century, it is now time for me to give everything I have to my family.\" Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

The first lady, always a fashionable breath of fresh air, showed off her on-point taste yet again at Saturday's Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Phoenix Awards dinner. FLOTUS stepped onto the CBC stage with President Obama, stunning in a checkered, full-skirted gown. But the pièce de résistance had to be that belt she craftily threw on top of the simple dress. The embellished black accessory appears to be the very same J.Crew belt Michelle wore to the inauguration back in January -- you know, the one that sold out about .5 seconds after Mrs. O was spotted wearing it. (Strangely enough, at $265, the cincher wasn't even a bargain, really.) It's nice to see Michelle continuing to mix it up for these high profile, glam events. We're sure the lucky few ladies who managed to scoop up the bejeweled belt will be taking note of FLOTUS' latest take. As for the rest of us?

Tesla\\'s correlation to high-performing malls mimics that of another star Silicon Valley tenant: Apple. A separate report issued by Goldman Sachs last year found that of the top 100 U.S. malls, 75 percent house an Apple. Both Tesla and Apple sell in-demand products with high price tags, which helps drive their store productivity. As a result, the malls in which they reside experience similar success.

Then there are holy fuck moments of television where you have a running tape of \"I can\\'t believe this is happening\" on loop in your brain. Game of Thrones\\' \"Battle of the Bastards\" is the latter—a truly exceptional episode in a series of exceptional episodes. All this was confirmed by the Emmys, who awarded seven Emmys (of the total 12 awarded to Game of Thrones) to \"Battle of the Bastards\" alone. It\\'s a record-breaking number of awards for a single episode of television. The record was previously held by E.R.\\'s pilot \"Love\\'s Labor Lost.\" \"Battle of the Bastards,\" which featured a brutal, stunning medieval battle between the armies led by Jon Snow and Ramsay Bolton, was not only a feat of acting, direction, and production design, it was also a feat of planning. Director Miguel Sapochnik explained the challenges, saying: The sheer logistics of staging a battle scene this size was like a battle in and of itself, minus the life/death thing... The creative decisions I make are heavily influenced by simple practical concerns. Like every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow on the field and rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that’s 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there’s just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off? The result was a stunning, emotional, cathartic episode that took home Emmys for: Outstanding Makeup for a Single-Camera Series (Non-Prosthetic) Outstanding Special Visual Effects Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series Outstanding Stunt Coordination for a Drama Series, Limited Series or Movie Outstanding Single Camera Editing For a Drama Series Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series Game of Thrones also won Emmys for Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series, Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup, Outstanding Costumes for a Period/Fantasy Series, Outstanding Production Design for a Narrative Contemporary or Fantasy Program, and Outstanding Drama Series.

              "  'context': 'Lying. Everyone is guilty of it, even though we know we shouldn\\'t do it. But are all lies alike? And why are some harder to remember than others? A new study, published in the Journal of Applied Research and Memory Cognition, separates lies into two general categories, and teases apart why one category of lies is so much easier to remember than the other. Researchers at Louisiana State University found that lies generally fall into the false description camp, or the false denial camp. With false descriptions, a person is actually fabricating details and events for the lie. Researchers say this makes the lie easier to remember because it takes more brainpower to create the false details. \"As the constructive process lays down records of our details and descriptions, it also lays down information about the process of construction,\" study researcher Sean Lane, an associate professor at the university, said in a statement. False denials, on the other hand, involve saying something didn\\'t happen when it in fact did. Because this kind of lie doesn\\'t require any extra brainpower to fabricate details, it\\'s harder to remember that you told the lie \"because there\\'s not much cognitively involved in the denial,\" Lane said in the statement. For the study, researchers instructed study participants to look at pictures of objects and then lie about them, either by denying that they saw them, or by fabricating descriptions of objects they in fact didn\\'t see. The study participants were better able to remember the false descriptions of the objects, versus their false denials that they\\'d seen an object. But of course, in the end, maybe the best way to avoid struggling to remember a lie is to avoid telling one at all. Remembering Lies: Why False Denials Will Inevitably Trip You Up',\n",

              "  'context': 'WASHINGTON -- Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) is retiring from Congress after 59 years. Dingell will make the announcement Monday at a luncheon in Downriver, Mich., according to the Detroit News. \"I’m not going to be carried out feet first,\" he told the paper. \"I don’t want people to say I stayed too long.\" Dingell is the longest-serving member of Congress in U.S. history, first coming to the House on Dec. 13, 1955 at the age of 29. He succeeded his father, John Dingell Sr., in a special election that year and went on to win a full term in 1956. Since then, he has been reelected 29 times. He is also one of two remaining World War II veterans in Congress; the other is Rep. Ralph Hall (R-Texas). Dingell officially became the longest-serving member on June 7, 2013, when he was feted by colleagues in both parties and by President Barack Obama for the milestone. Over the past five decades, he has worked with 11 presidents, served with 2,419 House colleagues and cast more than 25,000 votes. The Michigan Democrat will leave behind a legacy of hallmark legislation impacting civil rights, the environment, health care and workers\\' rights. He presided over the passage of Medicare in 1965, and he wrote the Endangered Species Act, the 1990 Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. He was the lead author of the Affordable Care Act, the Patient\\'s Bill of Rights, the Children\\'s Health Insurance Program and the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. He has also been a staunch defender of the U.S. auto industry. Dingell served for years as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, arguably the most powerful committee in the House. During his tenure, he subpoenaed top administration officials under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and led oversight hearings that exposed corruption in various government agencies. One of his investigations uncovered $600 toilet seats at the Pentagon. \"We emptied the top leadership of the EPA,\" Dingell told Newsweek in 2006. \"We put a large number of FDA people in jail.\" He lost his chairman post to Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) in 2008, though he was given the title of chairman emeritus in honor of his years leading the committee. Dingell hasn\\'t had much trouble getting reelected over the years, receiving less than 62 percent of the vote just twice when Republicans swept the House in 1994 and 2010. He didn\\'t even have a GOP opponent in 1988 and 2006. Still, it nearly cost him his election early on when he came out in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He told the Associated Press that the Wall Street Journal gave him a \"one in 15 chance\" of winning the race that year. Dingell already knew his way around the halls of Congress before his first House run. He was a congressional page from 1938 until 1943. He joined the Army in 1944 and later attended Georgetown University, where he graduated with a chemistry degree and eventually a Juris Doctor. He worked as a lawyer in private practice until 1955, when his father passed away and he decided to run for his House seat. Between Dingell and his father, the two have represented the southeastern Michigan area for more than 80 years. \"Decades after his father first introduced a bill for comprehensive health reform, John continued to introduce health care legislation at the beginning of every session. And as an original author of the Affordable Care Act, he helped give millions of families the peace of mind of knowing they won’t lose everything if they get sick,\" Obama said in a statement. \"Today, the people of Michigan -- and the American people -- are better off because of John Dingell’s service to this country, and Michelle and I wish him, his wife Debbie, and their family the very best.\" John Dingell Retiring After Nearly 60 Years In Congress',\n",

At first, investors didn't appear too pleased with Sunny Optical Technology Group Co.'s 77 percent increase in second-half 2016 net income. But now the maker of smartphone cameras seems to have been forgiven. Despite beating estimates, Sunny Optical's Hong Kong-traded stock tumbled 4 percent on Tuesday. Much of that was recouped in early trading on Wednesday, amid volumes about 1.7 times the 20-day average. To put those moves in context, Sunny's 66 percent rise this year -- including a 10.4 percent pop on Friday before the results -- makes it the best performer in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Investors have been betting that strong demand and higher prices for dual-lens cameras would drive earnings. Which they did. They also know that what goes up must come down, so the debate being played out this week is whether now is the time for a fall, or whether there's more room for growth. If anyone was looking for an excuse to sell after the company released earnings late Monday, they found it in the fact that Sunny's strongest sales growth in two years was below estimates. Yet a bullish sign could be found in a gross margin that was more than 2 percentage points wider than anticipated, and the highest in almost five years. And that's kind of the problem. Sunny's biggest risk is margin shrinkage as competitors ramp up production of dual cameras and enter areas where it has enjoyed nascent growth, such as drones and cars. Largan Precision Co., which makes camera lenses, posted a 38 percent year-on-year jump in sales for the January-February period, for example. In two separate reports this month, Jefferies analyst Rex Wu outlined the problem for Sunny and its shareholders. A survey in China found that consumers listed a dual camera as the most desirable smartphone feature, with 55 percent saying they'd be willing to pay more for one. Tellingly, they didn't seem to care much about water proofing or force touch. Sunny Optical stock, YTD +66% Post earnings, Wu argued that profits are more sensitive to shrinking gross margins for dual cameras than they are to sales volumes, and noted competition is getting more intense. While Wu raised his income forecast, he was the only analyst tracked by Bloomberg to cut his recommendation (from buy to hold), saying it's time for the stock to take a breather. Blurring the picture further is the fact that the consensus among analysts this week has been to raise their price targets on Sunny, but not by much and to an average barely above where the shares currently trade. That puts the onus back on the buy-side to decide: Are the clouds growing dark for this index star, or is the future, well, sunny?

              "  'context': 'The 2016 demise of Marco Rubio has been obvious for a while, but it is nevertheless a very big event. He was the Republican Party’s choice. He lost. Starting last fall, I said he would be the most likely winner. I continued saying that through the early primaries and caucuses. In fact, he seemed on track to win up until his disappointing Super Tuesday on March 1, and even in the days after that I thought he was in fairly good shape -- that is, right up until his support collapsed the weekend after Super Tuesday. Since I have been dead wrong about Rubio, I can\\'t turn around immediately and tell you why he lost. It’s something all of us who study presidential nominations are going to need to study, and it’s going to take some time, especially for those who believe that strong parties made up of formal organizations and informal networks control their presidential nominations. Is this year a fluke? A sign that the system has changed? Frankly, I don’t know right now. But I can run through some reasonable explanations of what happened with Rubio. The party chose a fatally flawed candidate. Some commentators have floated variations of this explanation. One is that Rubio wasn’t appealing to Republican voters. But for most of the contest, Rubio’s favorability scores among Republicans were excellent. Even when he lagged in the horse-race polls, he usually did well when pollsters probed beyond the top vote choice among Republicans. I’m also skeptical of blaming his position on immigration or his hawkish foreign policy. Both John McCain and Mitt Romney won Republican nominations with problems that were more severe. A more plausible explanation of Rubio\\'s weakness is that he choked under pressure. His poor debate before the New Hampshire primary when he repeated a line multiple times, and his debate after Super Tuesday when he got down in the mud with Trump, both appear to have been disasters. The party is broken. Though parties normally choose their nominees, this Republican Party isn\\'t normal -- it’s dysfunctional. Political scientist Norman Ornstein has pushed this line since August, and he could be correct. Republicans\\' attacks on experts, the media and even the \"establishment\" of their own party made it more difficult than it should have been to explain why Donald Trump was such a pariah. But it was about more than Trump. Party actors took a long time to decide on Rubio, and even then their choice wasn’t close to a consensus. Some of them permitted Jeb Bush to stay in through South Carolina, and he spent that Bush faction\\'s considerable resources targeting Rubio. Another substantial faction supported Ted Cruz, even though many Washington Republicans dislike him so much that they were willing to play footsie with Trump back in January. And John Kasich has had a fair amount of party support as well, which perhaps is why he has been able to fight on. Trump. No theory could have accounted for him. (People have used the analogy of the Mule in Isaac Asimov’s \"Foundation\" books, a mutant whose inhuman abilities disrupted the normal development of politics in the universe.) But I’m skeptical of this explanation, too. Trump is good at grabbing the new media\\'s attention, but it’s hard to see much evidence that he’s unusually talented in any other way. Still, if the party\\'s power flows from its ability to capture voters’ attention, it fizzled when the news coverage of Trump overwhelmed other sources of information. None of the above explanations are mutually exclusive. Perhaps they all played a role. Rubio finished just 1 percent of the vote behind Trump in Iowa. If Republican party actors had converged on him a few weeks earlier – or if Bush’s super PAC had targeted Trump or Cruz with some of the ads aimed at Rubio, the Florida senator could easily have finished second or even won the state, perhaps knocking out Cruz. If he hadn’t botched the New Hampshire debate, he probably would have finished second there, knocking out Kasich (probably) and Bush (perhaps) earlier and setting up a better finish in South Carolina. If Kasich had dropped out after South Carolina and Nevada, Rubio might have won Virginia on Super Tuesday and picked up a lot more delegates in other states that day. If only three candidates remained when Rubio began attacking Trump, Rubio’s supporters might have stuck with him. And if Rubio had performed better while attacking Trump, it’s possible that none of the rest would have mattered. Every candidate has \"ifs\" they can look back on. Rubio, however, may not have needed all of these things to break this way -- maybe only a few. Maybe only one. The take-away here is that Rubio’s loss is inconsistent with the theory that parties control nominations and that Trump’s success is inconsistent with views the scholars of political parties have had about the presidential-selection process. When more evidence emerges, we can adjust our theories or, sometimes, toss them out entirely and search for new ones. For everyone else, the campaign goes on, with three unexpected candidates remaining. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

              "  'context': 'Hollywood loves a fairytale, and on March 29, 1993, it got one all to itself. That night, at the 65th Academy Awards, a young underdog with a handful of bit roles in movies, one soap opera, and one sitcom under her belt beat out her four fellow nominees in the Actress in a Supporting Role category—for a role in a comedy. The category’s four other nominated actors—Judy Davis, Joan Plowright, Vanessa Redgrave, and Miranda Richardson—all had more experience and critical respect. Their movies (Husbands and Wives, Enchanted April, Howards End, and Damage, respectively) were decidedly heavier and more Oscar-friendly than the crowd-pleasing sleeper hit, My Cousin Vinny, for which the Oscar was awarded to Tomei. Maybe worst of all, Vinny had been released over a year before the 1993 ceremony—and the Academy has a notoriously bad memory for anything released before Q4\\'s \"Oscar season.\" But against all odds, Marisa Tomei won. On the way up the stairs to the podium, she nearly tripped. It was a bad omen. Within a year, her fairytale night had been overtaken by fiction: a rumor circulated that Marisa Tomei wasn’t the intended winner of the Oscar she took home. It started, ironically, as a correction. On Tuesday, March 22, 1994, the day after that year’s Academy Awards ceremony, The Hollywood Reporter printed an item called \"And the loser is: bad Oscar rumor,\" which detailed an alleged word-of-mouth conspiracy theory: A rumor is currently making the rounds in Manhattan, fanned by no less than the former son-in-law of a distinguished Academy Award winner, to wit that last year Marisa Tomei received her Oscar statue by error, with a resultant scandal about it soon to be exposed, much to the shame of the Academy. (All of this quite erroneous, I hasten to add, but do read on.) According to the rumor, it happened because Oscar presenter Jack Palance hadn’t been able to read the name written in the secret envelope when he was on stage announcing 1992\\'s best supporting actress winner. Instead of asking for help, so sayeth the tale, Palance arbitrarily called out Tomei’s name instead of the actual winner. (Since the story is bunk, there’s no need to reveal the name of the lady who was/is being bandied as the \"real\" winner of that specific prize.) It makes for provocative gossip, all right, but it didn’t happen. And for a good reason: When the Oscar ceremonies first went public on television back in 1953, Academy officials were aware of the possibility that one day some presenter might make such an error, either accidentally or for some mischievous purpose. So ever since then, at each and every Academy ceremony — including last night’s event, and the preceding year’s — two members of the accounting firm of Price-Waterhouse, the company that has tabulated the final Oscar ballots since 1935, are present in the wings during each Oscarcast. In the event a presenter should err in naming the correct winner in any category, said P-W official has been instructed to immediately go to the podium and announce that a mistake had been made. So Marisa, stand assured that Oscar is adamantly yours, no matter what rumor may sayeth to the contrary. Virtually every item that has been written about this theory (its snopes entry, for example) names the Hollywood Reporter item as its printed origin. It only spread from there—in the April 8, 1994 issue of Entertainment Weekly, the rumor crossed over from the trades to a consumer rag with a much wider circulation. EW’s piece further twisted the \"nasty-and-totally-unfounded little tidbit\": As the rumor goes, award presenter Jack Palance inadvertently read the name of the final nominee off the TelePrompTer, instead of the name in the envelope. And depending on who tells the story, the winner was either Judy Davis for Husbands and Wives or Vanessa Redgrave for Howards End. The EW piece repeated the bit about a Price Waterhouse official being authorized to interrupt the ceremony, and implied that the rumor spread because Tomei had \"made a few enemies\" since winning the Oscar. It also included a quote from her publicist at the time, Gina Rugolo, who said, \"It’s not even worth commenting on.\" Later that year, Tomei disregarded Rugolo’s words when she hosted SNL. During the opening monologue of the Oct. 1, 1994 episode, Tomei addressed the gossip seconds after walking out on stage: Before we start, I wanted to say something, just wanted to clear the air. There’s this crazy rumor, some of you may have heard it, some of you may have not, that when I won the Academy Award for My Cousin Vinny, that I didn’t really win the Oscar, that because Jack Palance accidentally read the wrong name off the teleprompter. But that’s just absolutely not true! I won the Academy Award, fair and square, and I was just the happiest I’d ever been, since, um, since I was named Ms. Teenage America, thank you, back in 1987, the year it was hosted by Jack Palance. Or three years later when I stepped up on stage to receive—though I didn’t think I was eligible for it—the Heisman Trophy from Jack Palance. Anyway, the only award I ever felt slightly guilty about was when I was 16 and I was named Employee of the Month at Roy Rogers restaurant by the assistant manager, Jack Palance. Anyhow, that’s out of the way... Two years later, SNL revisited the rumor in a skit called \"The Joe Pesci Show,\" during which Cheri Oteri played Tomei and Jim Breuer played Tomei’s Vinny co-star, Joe Pesci. In the skit, Pesci and Robert De Niro (played by John Goodman) mock Tomei by suggesting that she received her Oscar in exchange for sex and that her \"fair and square\" claim was a lie. [There was a video here] It didn’t matter that the story was presented to the public in the form of a denial (with Academy Awards officials repeatedly weighing in) or that Tomei herself addressed it and attempted to laugh it off—it persisted. In a Los Angeles Times article that ran on March 23, 1995, columnist Steve Harvey reported \"the rumor still hasn’t died\" and said it had been invoked at the recent Southern California Sports Broadcasters Assn. Awards. During a 1997 episode of Geraldo, the quintessentially bitchy critic Rex Reed is said to have deemed the supposed truth behind Tomei’s win \"Hollywood’s best-kept secret.\" A reader named James Berg wrote in to Roger Ebert’s \"Movie Answer Man\" column asking him to shed light on Reed’s allegations, reporting what he’d seen on Geraldo: According to Reed, a blunder by presented Jack Palace erroneously resulted in the awarding of the statue to Marisa Tomei for My Cousin Vinny, instead of Vanessa Redgrave. Reed explained a \"stoned\" or \"drunk\" Palance read the last name on the Teleprompter and did not properly open the envelope and name the winner as Redgrave. Ebert referred back to a column he’d written just months before on the matter and then quoted Academy Executive Director Bruce Davis, who said, \"There is no more truth to this version than to any of the others we’ve heard.\" Davis also repeated that Price Waterhouse officials would take to the podium in the case of an error, adding, \"They are not shy.\" From the start, all evidence explicitly pointed to bullshit, and yet enough people believed the story to keep it alive for years. Maybe it was selective exposure, the psychological theory that people will believe what they want to believe, regardless of the actual information being communicated. (When I thought back to this rumor, I remembered that Entertainment Weekly printed it—I did not remember that EW ran it in the form of a correction. That such a fuck-up could occur and be allowed to stand is a tantalizing prospect.) Can you blame them? The setting for Tomei’s win was a perfect storm: She was a dark horse newcomer nominated for a comedy that was by then over a year old. Presenting her the award was a 74-year-old wild card who’d done one-armed pushups during his Oscars acceptance speech the year before (incidentally, he also won for a comedy: City Slickers). Before naming Tomei in 1993, Palance called Judy Davis \"Joan\" and said that Davis was British (she’s Australian). If any presenter at the Oscars could be called unreliable, it was Palance. Just believable enough to be spread, spread just enough to take hold, it was the kind of Hollywood rumor that would be impossible to kill. Would be, if you didn’t have access to the video. What makes the rumor particularly fascinating in retrospect is that it occurred before the rise of instant video online. If Tomei had won this year, there would never have been a question about the integrity of her Oscar—just a few keystrokes would allow you to disprove the story to all but the blind and very dumb. Search YouTube and you’ll see that Palance clearly reads Tomei’s name off the card in the envelope—there’s no second consultation of the teleprompter, he’s not making it up as he goes along. (If nothing else, the Tomei rumor will go down as one of the last great Hollywood conspiracy theories of the pre-internet era. It was much easier to miss things, much harder to retrieve what you’d already read and remembered just a bit of; in the ‘90s, if you missed SNL, you were out of luck. Sure, maybe you recorded it on VHS, but if you didn’t, you had no blogs to rely on to report on what happened the night before. You can see how easy it was to say, \"I heard on SNL they said Marisa Tomei didn’t win her Oscar...\") In any event, it quickly became clear that the rumor was only one of Tomei’s problems. Worse than the whispers was the actual direction of her career. She’d fallen victim to the so-called \"Best Supporting Actress Curse\"—the same one that afflicted Geena Davis, Mercedes Ruehl, Mira Sorvino, Kim Basinger, Marcia Gay Harden, Renée Zellweger, Jennifer Hudson, Penélope Cruz, Mo’Nique, and Melissa Leo, who all saw their acting careers slump or cease existing after their wins. Getting an Oscar, of course, isn’t a bad peak to anyone’s career. But no one wants to peak that early. This quote from a 2001 profile in Australia’s Sunday Telegraph says it all: \"After My Cousin Vinny...I expected my career to be bigger than it is now,\" [Tomei] said as she celebrated her 36th birthday. Soon enough, it got bigger. The following year, Tomei was nominated for another Oscar (for In the Bedroom); seven years later, she was nominated again, for 2008\\'s The Wrestler. She didn’t win either time, but inevitably the Vinny controversy came up in press regarding both nominations. She was asked to explain the rumor repeatedly (\"hurtful\" is how she put it)—at least the continued reporting on it included her voice. Tomei was allowed to reclaim her story. Tomei is now one of only 21 people to be nominated for the Actress in a Supporting Role trophy three times or more; she’s appeared in several movies that have grossed over $100 million (including Anger Management, Parental Guidance, and Wild Hogs); and she was recently cast as Gloria Steinem in HBO’s upcoming Ms. miniseries. That Marisa Tomei ended up doing pretty well for herself. Now that Tomei’s career is ascendant again, the most pernicious effect of the rumor might be the implication that she didn’t deserve the Oscar in the first place. She did. Out of all of the movies nominated in her category, My Cousin Vinny is the only one that remains relevant today through cable and broadcast reruns (thanks to it being, you know, entirely enjoyable). And a big component of its charm is Tomei’s sparkling performance as one of those tough-broad East-Coast Italian roles loved by actors and audiences alike. Playing a broad comic part with depth and nuance is a difficult feat, and Tomei nailed it. She earned her Oscar just as much as Vinny earned that acquittal.

              "  'context': 'Shopping for a smartphone can be an intimidating process. After all, you’ll likely spend the next two years with whichever digital companion you buy, so you’d better choose wisely. If you’re an Apple fan, you’re getting an iPhone. You know it, I know it, your goldfish Steve knows it. But if you’re looking for an Android phone, then oh boy do you have choices. The newest big-name Android handsets are Samsung’s Galaxy S7, HTC’s 10, and LG’s G5. Each one has impressive features, but only one is the best. Samsung Galaxy S7: Samsung’s Galaxy S7 looks a lot like its predecessor, the Galaxy S6. It features a metal frame ensconced by front and back glass panels. Everything about the phone’s design is nearly perfect. Adding to that is the fact that the S7 is waterproof. You can drop the handset in up to 3 feet of water for 30 minutes and it will keep working, no problem. Unfortunately, thanks to its smooth glass body, the S7 is also a fingerprint magnet, which takes away from its luster. HTC 10: The HTC 10 comes completely wrapped in a metal body with exaggerated chamfered edges that cause light to delicately reflect off of the handset. Up front, an edge-to-edge glass panel makes the 10 feel as luxurious as any phone on the market. It is, however, a bit on the bulky side. LG G5: Like the S7 and 10, the LG G5 sports a metal body. But the G5 is unique in that the handset has no physical home button on its front panel. Instead, LG has placed the home button on the back of the phone within easy reach of your pointer finger. The G5 has been designed as a modular handset, which means you can remove the bottom of the phone to do things like change its removable battery or add a camera or speaker extensions. The takeaway: Each of these phones is well-designed and attractive, but the fact that the S7 is waterproof is incredibly appealing. Sure the LG G5 allows you to swap out your battery, but I’d rather have to recharge my phone than worry about it being ruined after falling in a puddle. Display Samsung Galaxy S7: Packing a 5.1-inch display, the Galaxy S7’s Super AMOLED (active matrix of organic light-emitting diodes) display is among the brightest and most vibrant you’ll find on a smartphone. Colors explode off the screen, and blacks are incredibly deep. The only downside: Colors can look exaggerated at times, causing things like blue skies to look a bit unnatural. HTC 10: HTC equipped the 10 with a 5.2-inch Super LCD 5 display that when viewed head-on looks clear and crisp. The problem is that the 10’s screen is incredibly dim. By itself its screen seems plenty bright, but place it next to the S7, and it’s a completely different story. LG G5: HTC’s 10 isn’t the only phone with a dim display. In fact, the LG G5’s 5.3-inch panel is even dimmer than the 10’s. Like the 10, text and images viewed on the G5 look clean and sharp, but the screen just isn’t bright enough even when viewed inside under normal lights. Trying to view the screen in bright sunlight is almost uncomfortable. The takeaway: There’s no contest here, the Galaxy S7 has the brightest, most colorful display of the group. Camera Samsung Galaxy S7: Samsung made a big deal about the S7’s new 12-megapixel camera — and for good reason. It takes some of the best shots you’ll get with a smartphone. Colors look fantastic, and details are razor sharp. What’s more, the S7 is an absolute beast when it comes to taking pictures in low-light situations. That said, Samsung’s cameras tend to exaggerate certain colors. HTC 10: The HTC 10’s 12-megapixel rear camera is one of the most capable shooters HTC has produced. Images come out clear, and low-light photos are reasonably clean. If this was your everyday shooter, you’d have little to complain about. That said, the 10’s camera doesn’t offer as much color as the S7’s. Instead, some scenes can look a bit washed out. You’ll also see some pixelation in your low-light shots. And taking pictures with too much movement while in low-light situations causes a good deal of blurring. LG G5: The G5 is unique in that it has two separate lenses for different shooting situations. One lens is used for your standard close-up shots and captures 16-megapixel images, while the other is designed for large panoramic pictures and captures 8-megapixel images. In reality, though, you’ll more than likely end up using the phone’s standard 16-megapixel camera. Photos taken with the G5’s 16-megapixel shooter were clear and artifact-free. In terms of color, the G5’s shots fell between the HTC 10 and Galaxy S7. They weren’t washed out or were they overly saturated. Low-light shots were clear, though not as bright as the Galaxy S7’s pictures. The takeaway: None of these three phones takes bad photos, but between the three, I lean toward the Galaxy S7’s camera, as I’m a fan of its exaggerated colors and its low-light photo capabilities. Performance Samsung Galaxy S7: Powered by a quad-core processor and 4GB of RAM, the S7 is an incredibly powerful handset. I’ve been using the phone since it came out and haven’t seen any signs of slowdown or lag. I’m also continually impressed by how fast the S7’s fingerprint reader unlocks the handset. The S7 comes with 32GB of onboard storage. And if you run through all of that, you can always throw in your own microSD card to increase the S7’s storage capacity. The S7’s battery will last all day on a single charge, and thanks to its fast-charging capabilities, you can get a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes. HTC 10: The HTC 10 comes with the same quad-core processor and 4GB of RAM as the S7, so you’re not going to see a huge difference between the two handsets in terms of performance. Also like the S7, the 10 comes with 32GB of storage that can be expanded using the phone’s microSD card slot. Like the Galaxy S7, the 10 will also charge to 50 percent in 30 minutes. LG G5: It’s déjà vu all over again, folks. The LG G5, like the HTC 10 and S7, has the same processor and 4GB of RAM. In other words, these phones are all fast. You’ll also get 32GB of onboard storage that can be expanded with a microSD card. The LG G5 does, however, have a slightly smaller battery than the S7 and HTC 10. Still, you can remove and replace the G5’s power plant when it’s running low on juice, something you can’t do with the S7 or HTC 10. The takeaway: You’re not going to see any major differences in terms of performance between these three phones, but the LG G5’s removable battery sets it apart from the pack. Software Samsung Galaxy S7: Samsung’s Galaxy S7 runs on the Google’s Android 6.0 operating system, but augments the software with its own TouchWiz interface. TouchWiz basically changes Android’s home screen, icon designs, and notifications menu to give it a more Samsung-centric look. Normally I dislike it when smartphone makers mess with Google’s Android, and Samsung used to be the No. 1 offender when it came to screwing with the software. But in recent years, the company has eased up on its changes. Its new version of TouchWiz is less intrusive than previous iterations and easier to navigate. It’s still not pure Android, though. HTC 10: This is as close to running an untouched version of Google’s Android 6.0 software as you can get short of buying one of Google’s own Nexus phones. HTC has only made slight changes to Google’s Android interface, and the user experience is better for it. On top of that, HTC has done away with its own apps that essentially mirror existing Google apps, so you don’t have to deal with having two photo gallery apps or two Web browsers. LG G5: LG also runs Google’s Android 6.0 operating system, but unfortunately the OS is completely covered by LG’s confusing user interface. See, like Samsung, LG puts its own stamp on Android by changing the operating system’s icons and notification menu. But the notifications menu is such an odd bright green and white color scheme, that it’s almost hard to read. And LG’s decision to not give people a standard Android apps page and instead put every app on the phone’s various home screens like the iPhone is annoying. Suffice it to say, I’m not a fan. The takeaway: While Samsung has toned down its TouchWiz interface, I’ve got to give this round to HTC for going with what already works — straight-up Android. And the winner is ... After five rounds, the Samsung Galaxy S7 came out head and shoulders above its competitors. If you’re in the market for an Android phone, the S7 is easily the best option available. That said, if the ability to replace your phone’s battery is of the utmost importance, you should grab LG’s G5. Similarly, if you’re interested in an Android phone that doesn’t cover up the Android interface with a silly skin, the HTC 10 is worth checking out. But overall, the Samsung Galaxy S7 is the best Android phone you can buy. This is the best Android phone you can buy',\n",

Earlier this month, YouTuber Lizzy Wurst recorded a video that has since gone mega-viral. In the video, Wurst and her friend Sabrina try eating a Reaper pepper.  It. Does. Not. Go. Well. For. Them.  People couldn't get enough of it, mostly because Wurst and her friend's reactions are completely amazing.  But also, it made the whole world wonder: Just how spicy is this thing?  So, for journalism, we decided to find out just how spicy this thing is. TURNS OUT IT'S REALLY SPICY.  For reference, a jalapeño is, like, 3,500 Scovilles — which is the unit of measurement for spiciness. A Carolina Reaper pepper has been named the hottest pepper in the world by Guinness and it clocks in around 2 million Scovilles. First up, we have Tolani.  What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten?  I’m Nigerian so I feel like a lot of my meals are spicy and if the meal’s not spicy, I feel like it makes me feel a bit sick. We have a Nigerian dish, it’s called ayamase, it’s basically a lot of Scotch bonnets and loads of peppers mixed together to make a stew and you have it with rice. VERDICT: Not the worst thing that's ever happened or that's gone in my mouth, haha. But yeah, it's spicy. Then Ryan.  What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten? My mom's side of the family is from Oklahoma, which is kind of like the Canada of Texas, and they all love barbecue and trying different hot sauces. The spiciest thing I've ever eaten was a chili made with Ghost chili peppers — the second-hottest pepper in the world. It made me feel stoned and my face went numb. VERDICT: I wanted to eat the whole thing, but that was dumb. Very, very dumb. Honestly, though, I'd put a little bit of this on pizza or something. Now it's Aisha's turn. What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten? I used to have chili competitions with my friend. We would try to make the spiciest chutney and we used to even put Naga Morich in it, which is a Bengali spice — and a close cousin of the Ghost chili pepper. VERDICT: I underestimated it. It was really hot and I thought I was going to cry. Laura's up next.  What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten? Growing up in a typical American, semi-Jewish household, there was not much spice going on. My brother did like spicy foods, but that was, like, Sriracha sauce. The spiciest thing I’ve ever eaten would probably be, like, a curry. What’s the spicy one? Vindaloo? VERDICT: I thought I was going to throw up. Also, this happened... And finally, Luke.  What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten? I don’t like spicy food. It just doesn’t interest me. The spiciest thing I’ve ever eaten was probably, like, this pasta I ate once that had a load of chilis in it. I don’t know what the fuck they were, but they were chilis. VERDICT: It was really hot but, like, I could use it in cooking. My tongue hurt. Hurt quite a lot, but it's also not, like, intolerable.

              "  'context': 'Tap water in Flint, Michigan meets federal standards and is safe to drink, testing confirmed last month. But continued complaints from residents about its poor quality has prompted multiple protests -- and a comparison likening the questionable water to both the Holocaust and slavery. Rev. Charles Williams II, president of the Michigan chapter of the National Action Network, made the comment at a press conference and bottled water handout in Flint Monday, NBC 25 reports. \"This is almost as bad as gas chambers for Jews,\" Williams said. In a follow-up with FOX 2, Williams said forcing Flint residents to buy bad water is \"just as unjust as slavery. That\\'s just as unjust as genocide. An injustice is an injustice.\" Issues with water quality in Flint stretch back to last year, but were made official in January when residents were notified that the city was in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Water tested at the end of 2014 contained unacceptable levels of trihalomethanes (TTHM), chemicals that are a byproduct of chlorine. At the time, the city said water was safe to drink, but advised the elderly, parents of infants and anyone with a \"severely compromised immune system\" to consult a doctor because they may be at increased risk. The chlorine that led to an overabundance of TTHM chemicals was used as a disinfectant; Flint increased the level of chlorine in its drinking water last year to fight bacteria. Health risks associated with drinking water that contains excessive quantities of TTHM over multiple years include cancer, as well as liver, kidney and central nervous system issues, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Residents have reported skin problems and rashes seemingly caused by the water. Others have complained about headaches, hair loss, odor, and water that is cloudy or a startling shade of brown. According to the Detroit Free Press, the discoloration is likely unrelated to the TTHM levels, and instead caused by calcium and iron from pipes in the city’s aging water system. Flint used to buy pre-treated water from Detroit, but in a cost-cutting measure last year officials decided to build a pipeline to Lake Huron so the city could get its own water. The city has been getting its water from the Flint River since April as the pipeline project progresses. Many Flint residents might not have used Williams’ rhetoric, but plenty are seriously concerned about their water, and have been since the city made the switch last year. They have held continual protests and community events -- one attended by a water expert for Erin Brockovich -- and are not mollified by test results in February that showed TTHM levels were back below the federal maximum. \"I don\\'t even let my dogs drink this water,\" resident Rick Holtstander told the Associated Press. Local prekindergarten programs and the Flint Children\\'s Museum are not allowing children to drink tap water, according to MLive. General Motors stopped using Flint water at a local plant in October. They said high chloride levels in the drinking water were causing corrosion, according to WNEM. In a statement issued to MLive, the city said officials share Williams’ frustrations, but think his \"accusations are a gross misrepresentation of the Flint water condition and a wholly inappropriate comparison.\" Flint has formed a Water Advisory Committee and hired a consultant, who on Wednesday recommended changes to infrastructure and the chemicals used to treat the water. In a statement following last month\\'s test results, Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft said staff will be \"vigilant\" about water safety. \"Findings by the [Michigan Department of Environmental Quality] reinforce the progress we have made, and should help rebuild confidence in the safety of Flint’s drinking water,\" Croft said. Last month, the state of Michigan awarded Flint $2 million to upgrade its water system. Reverend Compares Michigan City\\'s Drinking Water Issues To The Holocaust',\n",

Have you felt it?\" Followed by \"The dark side...and the light.\" With all the visuals that we can break down, there’ are only these two brief snippets of actual dialogue to consider. The first and most important question may be, who is speaking? The identity of the narrator was a big topic of discussion Friday after the trailer hit. Speculation about the person’s identity ran from Max Von Sydow to Adam Driver, Andy Serkis and even Benedict Cumberbatch. The last one isn’t even in the movie, but it sounds a bit like him. Because he was at the center of J.J. Abrams’ last big mystery, it was a fun option to consider. There will be no more considering. The identity of the Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer voice has been revealed. Update: Andy Serkis has given a brief radio interview confirming that it is his voice in the trailer. Watch that below. The Force Awakens trailer voice is, in fact, Andy Serkis, seen below in his Avengers: Age of Ultron look. Steve from Collider was the first to definitely say the voice was Serkis. Still many remained skeptical. Harry Knowles from Ain’t It Cool News even posted that he confirmed it was \"not\" Serkis, but that sentiment was quickly changed. Finally, Hitfix got on the case and bolstered Collider’s earlier point: For the record, that is Andy Serkis you hear in the trailer. I was able to verify this, although I was not able to uncover any further information about the role he plays. Here’s what I do know, though. He’s playing a pivotal role in the film, although he will not have a lot of screen time. That’s a very interesting piece of information. Does it make him an Emperor-like character? Possibly someone who’ll play a larger role later in the series? You have to think, if Serkis’ character can feel the event of the title – The Force Awakening – he’s gotta be crucial. That’s simply because not everyone can feel the Force. \"The Phantom Menace\" didn’t play a huge role in that movie, but he sure did later on. Maybe you’re still skeptical. Our own Dave Chen took a voice over performance from Cumberbatch and edited it back to back with this one, making it pretty obvious it’s not that actor. So that’s that. Andy Serkis is the voice in the Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer. Now, if only we knew who was holding that red lightsaber.

Walt Disney first built the park in 1971 as a supplement to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which the animation legend had opened 16 years earlier, on July 17, 1955. However, Orlando wasn’t the initial location that Walt considered for his second park. Plans had actually been drawn up in 1963 for an indoor theme park that was to be built in downtown St. Louis. Click here for the best restaurants at Disneyland Park. At the time, it made a lot of sense. Research showed that only five percent of Disneyland’s guests traveled from east of the Mississippi River, despite the fact that 75 percent of America’s population lived on that side of the country — and Walt desperately wanted the extra business. When the plans were drawn up, St. Louis was booming, the landmark Gateway Arch in St. Louis was under construction (it debuted in 1965), and Busch Stadium (est. 1966) was being built just a few blocks away. However, the would-be Missouri Disney World hit a few roadblocks. Anheuser-Busch beer baron August A. Busch Jr. (who ran much of the city) allegedly insisted that the theme park sell beer, which Walt refused to do in the name of a family-friendly environment. Additionally, Disney was only willing to pay for the rides and attractions, hoping St. Louis’ redevelopment corporation would pay for the building that was to house them. The corporation balked at the idea, and Disney officially scrapped his plans in 1965. Disney World is opening a bar in the Tower of Terror. Click here for details. According to 13 pages of blueprints that went to auction late last year, the plans for the St. Louis park included rides like Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion, and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad — all of which are now fixtures at the Florida park.

              "  'context': 'Last night, a very talented female actor presented a monologue in class. The acting was simple, clear, direct, and active—the hallmarks of proficiency. \"How did it go?\" I asked. \"Fine,\" she squeezed. \"Did you do what you wanted to do?\" I probed. \"No, it wasn’t true,\" she responded. After an improvisational acting exercise, she did a second take. My USC colleague Jack Rowe is often quick to note when an actor’s performance changes the air in the room. This was one of those moments. My gut seized and breath shortened as she spoke each syllable. A new kind of quiet filled the studio. With each move she made and each word she uttered, she seemed to be embarking upon a hero’s struggle, defying the gods for her sense of justice and peace. I felt a connection to the actors seated behind me and sensed I wasn’t the only one with tears in my eyes. The actor performing was not crying. There was a long silence when she finished the monologue. The moment transformed and she looked at me. \"How did it go?\" I queried. \"Fine,\" she said. I was surprised by her response, so I used her barometer from earlier and asked, \"Was it true?\" She responded, \"I don’t know. It was true for me but I don’t know if some guy on the street would think it was true!\" The actor, who had succeeded at the highest levels of the art form—reaching her audience, moving them, making them feel—was deferring to a stranger on the street to measure her success. From the moment we’re born, we’re labeled good or bad—by our parents and other adults, our teachers, our bosses, our spouses. It cycles, first validated or rejected by others, and then, as a result, seeking validation or rejection from others. Viola Spolin called this the Approval/Disapproval Syndrome, and it leads to creative paralysis. An actor’s value is constantly billboarded as synonymous with red carpets, expensive minimalist clothing, and pharmaceutical endorsements. Even in training, you perform a scene in the typical acting class and then receive the teacher’s critique about what was good or not. Regardless of the teacher’s talent, they can perpetuate the approval/disapproval cycle that promotes dependency and prevents creative freedom. Choice is the province of the artist and the trained actor must be able to answer for themselves if they did what they wanted to do. Henri Matisse, the famous painter, was painting a model. A guest in his studio looked at the model, looked at the painting, then looked at Matisse and said, \"You got her arm wrong.\" Matisse looked at the model, smiled, and then gestured to the canvas and responded, \"You see my friend, this, is a painting.\" The knowledge of whether the artist did what they wanted to do is vital for the kind of collaboration required on film sets because it allows for a degree of objectivity. I once watched a generous director ask an actor if he was good with the last take and ready to move on. The actor thought for a moment and said, \"No, I wanna try something. Do we have time for one more take?\" Without the ability to answer the question, \"Did I do what I wanted to do?\" the actor would’ve been the equivalent of a deferential child waiting for the director’s approval to move on instead of a collaborator who was part of the whole, free and willing to take risks to capture just the right brush stroke. If an actor is able to set specific goals in a scene, then they can measure them. If you decide in a scene to work on subtext, for example, then ask yourself afterward, \"Did I do what I wanted to do, work on the subtext?\" Then you may evaluate your focus on the inner life of the scene and assess if the inner action colored the text in a way that is beautiful and true (or if you lost concentration and became distracted by something else). Regardless of the answer, you will have a qualitative measurement about the relationship of subtext to the scene (or your own ability to concentrate). Most importantly, you will be breaking the cycle of reading the reviews to determine how good you are, and instead possess the freedom to paint the world truly, as you see it.

If you grew up in Latin America, or in a Latin American family, then you probably know El Chavo -- one of the most beloved characters in Mexican television history. \"El Chavo del Ocho\" has reached millions throughout Latin America and the U.S. since Roberto Gomez Bolaños created it in 1971. It has become a staple in Latin culture and many continue to watch reruns of the show to this day. Here are some fun facts about the timeless series that even some of the most die-hard fans might not know: 1. Better than the Super Bowl \"El Chavo Del Ocho\" averaged more viewers than the 2014 Super Bowl, which was the most watched program in American television history. The sporting event had 111.5 million viewers, according to CBS News. 2. What\\'s in a name? El Chavo\\'s real name was never revealed during the show but, during an interview in 2012, Gomez Bolaños seemed to mumble something referring to the character\\'s name. It remains unclear what it could be, some guess it\\'s Roberto. (Check out the interview in Spanish above) 3. El Chavo\\'s Diary A book titled \"El Diario del Chavo\" (El Chavo\\'s Diary), written by Gomez Bolaños after the show ended, revealed that the orphan boy known as \"El Chavo\" never knew his father. His working mother usually picked him up from daycare but, \"one day she didn\\'t show up,\" he writes. \"Or any day after that.\" 4.

His strategy: \"When you are expecting me to do the traditional thing, I will just choose to do something that is uncharacteristic.\" Ofeibea Quist-Arcton/NPR Nigeria is the English-speaking world\\'s Scrabble superpower. Africa\\'s most populous nation is home not only to the global Scrabble champion, but team Nigeria ranks as the world\\'s top Scrabble playing nation — ahead of the U.S. in second place. The Scrabble world champion is The Scrabble world champion is Wellington Jighere . He\\'s 33, has a soft voice, a slow smile and a penchant for fedoras, earning him the nickname \"the Cat in the Hat.\" Jighere acknowledges that he\\'s taciturn by nature, but also has an explosive, infectious laugh, though he considers Scrabble is serious business. \"You can\\'t afford to waste too much energy doing unnecessary chatter,\" he says. \"During a tournament, I see it as business time. And that is no time to be joking around.\" Jighere plays chess to relax, \"and for fun,\" he says. Jet-lagged and weary, Jighere was crowned the world Scrabble champ last year in a grueling 32-round competition in Australia. Up to 30 of the top 100 global players are from Nigeria, which has the highest percentage of any country in the top 200. The Nigerians\\' apparent collective strategy — short words that rack up the points. Nigerians have been credited with perfecting that tactic under the tutorship of senior team coach, Prince Anthony Ikolo. He says Nigerians are passionate about Scrabble and the short word method gives them an edge. Many put Nigeria\\'s towering Scrabble prowess down to its players ability to \"choke the board\" as they say, with this defensive play. \" The game of Scrabble is actually built around short words — especially five letter words,\" says Ikolo. \"If you have such a word base, then you are good to go. But it would be a very big mistake for the world to think our players only know short words, especially five-letter words,\" he warns. The coach says \"the short words help you to be defensive [by blocking longer words from opponents], but when it\\'s time to be offensive, we know those long words also. Nigeria is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to Scrabble,\" says Ikolo. Ikolo, who\\'s also a university mathematician, came up with lists of five-letter words and distributed them to his players, including Jighere the world champion, to train them how to block the board. The coach says, armed with these, the Nigerians could take on and beat competitors playing seven-eight- or even nine-letter words. The other strategy was to gather his players at a hotel, before the tournament, and have them play two days of nonstop Scrabble. It appears to have worked. Jighere though says his personal strategy is to have \"no strategy at all. I play a fluid kind of game. Yah. I really don\\'t have a particular kind of style that you can pin me to, \"he says. So, when you are expecting me to do the traditional thing, I will just choose to do something that is uncharacteristic. It\\'s what sets me apart from everyone else.\" Jighere should know. He and team Nigeria triumphed at the Jighere should know. He and team Nigeria triumphed at the World English-Language Scrabble Players Association world championship in Australia in November 2015. They fully intend to hang onto that success when they defend those titles next year in Kenya, he says. Nigeria\\'s president, Muhammadu Buhari, phoned Australia to congratulate him, says Jighere with a big smile. \"It felt so warm to have him speak with me right then and there. It was a very, very important experience. He told me how proud he is of my accomplishment and how proud I have made the nation as a whole, not just the nation but Africa as a whole. And that it has really gone to prove that we are truly the giants of Africa.\" Jighere bested a Briton in Perth, while Team Nigeria dethroned the U.S., which had been at the pinnacle for about decade, with Nigeria yapping at its heels, determined to topple the Americans. \"We are currently ranked No. 1 nation in the world for Scrabble,\" says the champ. \"In the world we have the highest number of persons in the top 100 rated Scrabble players. We have as many as 20 to 30 tough masters in Nigeria that can really give you a tough fight any time any day.\" Ikolo, the coach, will attest to that. Jighere\\'s friends and fellow Scrabble masters cut him no slack, in the jovial, noisy and garrulous atmosphere during the Lagos tournament. Ikolo gleefully told NPR that, until the Nigeria National Scrabble Players competition, in the main city Lagos, at the tail end of July, Jighere had failed to win any significant tournament after his success in Australia last year. \"Since he became the world champion, he has been beaten blue and black by his colleagues. It tells you how strong Nigeria\\'s Scrabble is. It tells you that the Scrabble scene we have here is a very tough one. It\\'s highly competitive and nobody can boast tomorrow that I\\'m going to win this, I\\'m going to win that when it comes to Nigerian Scrabble playing.\" So why Scrabble? \"Ah, I didn\\'t exactly choose Scrabble,\" says Jightere. \"I ran into some friends who were tournament players and I beat them. They told me \\'Ah, if I could do this well against them, that means I should come to the next tournament.\\' \" He adds, \"And I was like, \"Ah, you mean they play this in tournaments? OK, let\\'s go. And the rest, as they say, is history.\" And he laughs. That was in 2002. Today, Jighere sits atop the global Scrabble tournament ladder. He describes how he had to overcome fatigue and jet lag to win in Australia. Learn those words, commit them to memory and stay cool – and awake. Scrabble was given official recognition as a sport in Nigeria in the 1990s. But local players, coaches, parents, officials and tournament organizers say government assistance has been patchy and more must be done to support, sponsor and finance Scrabble. \"Why will the government and corporate firms not look the way of Scrabble?\" laments coach Okolo. \"Government and corporate firms should come to the aid of Scrabble.\" The Lagos State government provided the venue — Teslim Balogun stadium for indoor sports — for the recent tournament, as well as organizing some logistics. But senior team coach Ikolo says while cash prizes are welcome, the authorities — and corporate sponsors — should do more to capitalize on Nigeria\\'s global success at Scrabble. \"We don\\'t value that Nigeria is ranked the best Scrabble playing nation in the world,\" says Ikolo, \"and we have the world Scrabble champion, Wellington Jighere.\" Enlarge this image Angela \"I\\'m not very shy!\" Osaigbovo, 10, of Nigeria came in second in a recent youth tournament, and triumphed at Scrabble camp in August.

Ofeibea Quist-Arcton/NPR And yet Scrabble has caught on in Nigeria in a big way, among veterans and youth. There are scores of clubs up and down the 36 states of a nation of 180 million people. Daylong and weekend tournaments are held regularly and young players, like 10-year-old Angela Osaigbovo, are champions in their own right.

Thrusting her Scrabble board into the air, she then shakes her bag of tiles, and tells me, \"I\\'m good in Math and Literacy. And I think it\\'s due to Scrabble.\" As a scrabbler, she likes using \"premiums, or bingos, which are 7-letter words – such as zaniest, quiting and players.\" Relaxed and confident, Angela sits next to Vincent Okere, who\\'s 13. The teen won the local players championship and the trophy in the youth category in Lagos. He spent most of the tournament weekend prowling around the Masters, watching every Scrabble move by the veterans and, no doubt, learning. But no hard feelings, says Angela, who was working hard in the build-up to the youth championship at the Mind Sports International (MSI) global tournament in Lille, France, starting Saturday. Every other year, MSI organizes a championship for all-comers, while WESPA holds its tournaments the other years. \"Yes, I\\'m very excited. I\\'m aiming to win the WYSC – which is World Youth Scrabble Championship\" in Lille at the end of August, Angela told me, adding. \"I\\'m not very shy!\" Her mother, Toyin Osaigbovo, is delighted that Angela loves Scrabble and says her daughter possesses what Nigeria has in abundance — focus and determination. \"Nigerians are very determined and dogged people,\" says Osaigbovo. \"And once we set our minds to something, we achieve it.\" Angela had this warning for their global competitors — \"Watch out, because Nigeria is coming, with force!\" However, Angela\\'s disappointed mother told NPR her daughter was refused a French visa, so won\\'t be able to compete in Lille since the youth championship began Saturday. The champ, Wellington Jighere, announced yesterday that most Nigerian players who applied had also been denied visas to travel to France. Social media has been twitching with outrage.

Inside: We might not understand the real reason our kids ask, \"Why?\" But here’s the why behind the why’s, plus the magic phrase to stop kids asking why all day. I have a love-hate relationship with those kid-sized carts at the grocery store. Seeing my toddler stand a little taller as she steps up to the plate behind her very own cart? Love. Watching her methodically arrange every item in the cart like it’s the most important job in the world? Love. Being on high alert every time she moves a centimeter, to make sure she doesn’t ram the cart into the back of someone’s legs, take a corner too fast and dump all our groceries on the floor, or knock over the perfectly balanced display for this week’s sale on Pinot Grigio? No, thank you. Now Add This to the Mix A few weekends ago, we stopped by the store right before my toddler’s nap time. Which meant Bailey’s cart-driving style felt a lot like a game of Bumper Cars. With baby Charlie on my hip, I hovered close behind Bailey to head off disaster, offering super helpful warnings of \"Watch out!\" every five seconds. She’s two, so each time I said, \"Watch out,\" her response was, \"Why?\" Because you’re going to hit someone. Because you almost knocked over those watermelons. Because Mommy’s slowly losing her mind. With every \"why,\" my tone got sharper and my words got shorter. To save my sanity, I switched tactics and started putting my hand on her shoulder to slow her Tasmanian Devil rampage. We were managing alright until a middle-aged man took his life into his own hands by walking right in front of her cart as we entered an aisle. I reached out to grab her shirt. \"Watch where you’re going, Bails.\" \"Why?\" she asked. I sighed. \"Because that man stepped in front of you, and you almost ran into him.\" I let go, and she plowed ahead into the aisle, not at all flustered by the near-collision. \"Why?\" But it wasn’t from Bailey. My head snapped up, my narrowed eyes settling on the source. A guy. Smiling and chuckling at his joke. I guess the look on my face gave him the idea I wasn’t in a joking mood because his smile slipped, and he said, \"No, I get it!\" He gestured to a middle-school-aged kid trailing behind him. I recovered and laughed, but I didn’t linger to swap all our best parenting tips for coping with kids asking why because I had a loose cannon to chase. What We’re Doing Wrong When Our Kids Ask, \"Why?\" My overreaction to a stranger’s friendly comment was the wake-up call I needed. I realized that for the first few why’s of every day, I was the model of patience. I calmly explained whatever it was to my toddler, sometimes even coming up with a playful metaphor to bring the point home. But as we reached 5, 10, 20 why’s, my reserves of patience dried up. Not only that, she’d ask \"Why?\" for the same things, every day. Please shut the baby gate when you go upstairs. Why? It’s time to calm your body down for sleep. Why? Toothpaste is for brushing your teeth, not for eating. Why? Up until that weekend, I misunderstood what my toddler was really asking when she asked, \"Why?\" She didn’t want me to give her the right answer. Giving her the right answer meant she’d still ask the same question the next time. She wanted me to lead her toward the answer. The Magic Phrase to Use With Kids Asking Why After my eureka moment, I decided I wouldn’t answer the knee-jerk why’s anymore. new phrase that I use in those situations. Not only has this phrase saved my stores of patience for more important things like Instead, I came up with athat I use in those situations. Not only has this phrase saved my stores of patience for more important things like when my toddler colors on the furniture with a Sharpie , but it’s also cut way back on the number of why’s I hear every day. Even when I do hear a why, my toddler will often jump right in after her own question to offer up an idea for an explanation. If you’re tired of answering your child’s why’s and don’t want to resort to \"Because I said so,\" try saying this instead: \" \"You tell me why.\" And wait for her to come up with an explanation. Your little one might need a gentle nudge when you first try this out, so feel free to ask some follow-up questions to get her gears turning. For example: What would happen if...?

Do you see where we keep food in our house? Is that where we keep the toothpaste? Start with this, and go from there: \" \"You tell me why.\" This phrase has been a lifesaver in the last few weeks. I now have a positive way to respond to kids asking why, giving me one fewer trigger for losing my cool with my little ones. But First, a Disclaimer This is the important part: You have to keep your cool when saying, \"You tell me why.\" If you grit your teeth or heave a big sigh or use a snappy tone, it won’t work. You have to want to hear your child’s ideas for this phrase to be effective. And kids are intuitive. They’ll know if you don’t really mean it, and you won’t achieve your desired effect. In other words, have fun continuing to answer \"Why?\" 70 million times a day. I made the mistake of using a snappy tone one day, and my daughter shut down. She wouldn’t answer me, and the phrase stopped working. We were back to square one. So I took a break for a few days and tried \"You tell me why\" again. I kept my tone curious and upbeat, and lucky for me, the damage wasn’t permanent. The magic lived on! A few more caveats for you: Your little one’s brain is working, working, working. Be patient while she comes up with an answer. It might take a few more seconds than you’d expect. You can always try a follow-up question like the ones I gave above, but sometimes just waiting will do the trick. Be patient while she comes up with an answer.

If you cross your arms and show frustration on your face, this phrase won’t work. One trick I’ve found works well is to cock my head a little to one side while I wait. This shows her I’m interested in what she has to say. (I learned this trick from my friend Lauren, who has lots more useful tips on how to teach kids to listen without using words.)

You might need to fill in the holes. Your kid is figuring out how this big crazy world works, so her first explanation won’t always be spot on. Try to find something you can agree with in her explanation, then bridge from that to your explanation. For example, suppose you tell her to stop eating toothpaste and her first explanation is, \"Because it tastes bad.\" You might reply with, \"That’s right. It doesn’t taste as good as food. But also, it doesn’t have the healthy vitamins and other stuff your body needs from food. And if you swallow too much toothpaste, you might get a tummyache.\" Your kid is figuring out how this big crazy world works, so her first explanation won’t always be spot on.

This worked with my kiddo, and the friends I’ve shared it with said it worked for them, too. But every kid is different, so I can’t guarantee it’ll work for you. Just give it a try for a few days and see what happens. Worst case, you end up back where you started. And best case, you’ll hear about 69 million fewer why’s a day. What This Phrase Won’t Do Even though this phrase is magic, it won’t help your kid avoid wreaking havoc while pushing her own cart around the grocery store. If you’re like me and you have a love-hate relationship with those kid-sized shopping carts, let me know if you figure out the secret to avoiding frustration as you hover behind your kid. In the meantime, I considered trying to convince her the carts aren’t as fun as she thinks, but after thinking it through, here’s what I decided: When my toddler asks if she can push her own shopping cart at the store, I’ll humor her, every time. Because one day, she won’t ask to push a kid-sized cart. And I’ll ask, \"Aren’t you going to grab a cart, honey?\" She’ll wrinkle her nose and say, \"No, Mom.\" In that moment, three thoughts will pop-pop-pop through my mind: She calls me \"Mom\" now? She’s too grown-up to push a kid’s cart? I miss the why stage. So on that day, don’t be surprised if you find me pushing my own cart through the store, ugly-crying while she hangs back pretending she doesn’t know me.

The network has chosen a new name, in the hopes of shedding what it seems to have deemed an unfairly wholesome reputation: \"Freeform.\" \"Our core viewers know what to expect from our content,\" Network President Tom Ascheim told LA Times. \"But among nonviewers, there’s a very different perception of our brand. We over-indexed on two adjectives: one was family-friendly and the other was wholesome. It led us to believe that the huge perception gap is based on our name.\" Ascheim told LA Times that the network is shifting its focus away from the millennials, whom they’ve successfully courted for over a decade, and instead looking at people ages 18 to 34—a life stage they describe as \"becomers.\" Indeed, the days are long gone when squeaky-clean programming ruled their lineup. Glossier shows like Pretty Little Liars now dominate instead. One of the network’s recent shows featured a protagonist who was fresh out of five years in juvie. The network has changed a lot—including its name, multiple times—since it was founded in 1977 as an arm of the Christian Broadcasting Network. (The 700 Club, a Christian talk show and one of the network’s oldest programs, still airs on the network.) Back then, it was called the CBN Satellite Service. The name morphed to CBN Cable Network, then to CBN Family Channel, then to the Family Channel (FAM). Over that time, the channel gradually folded more and more secular programming into its lineup—when it became the Family Channel in 1990, only 25 percent of its schedule was devoted to spiritual programming. In 2001, it became ABC Family. Since then, the network has been inching toward edginess, pushing against the constraints of its family-friendly rep. In 2006, ABC Family adopted the slogan \"A New Kind of Family,\" and introduced programming like sci-fi drama Kyle XY. In 2007, we got the bubbly college-centric series Greek, and in 2008, the trailblazingly sympathetic portrayal of teen pregnancy in The Secret Life of the American Teenager.

              "  'context': 'Long the nation\\'s most populated county, Los Angeles hit a demographic milestone earlier this year: 10 million residents. The county is now estimated at 10,019,365 people as of July 1, according to California Department of Finance data released Thursday. The figure includes all residents, regardless of immigration status. The densely-populated county\\'s growth has inched along in recent years at an under 1-percent clip, particularly slowing during the recession. In past years, the department had even estimated it had already hit 10 million, only to revise the figures later as growth was found to have slowed more than expected. But analysts say finally hitting the milestone serves to highlight just what a powerful political and economic engine the Los Angeles region represents. It has more people than 43 states, and on its own would be the 88th most populous country in the world, ahead of Sweden or Austria, for example. \"It\\'s impressive,\" said Tom Hogen-Esch, a political science professor at Cal State Northridge. \"We\\'re one of the largest political entities in the U.S. and our budget ...would make us one of the largest countries in the world.\" Bill Schooling, the Department of Finance\\'s chief of demographic research said \"it appears very likely\" that the new estimate of at least 10 million will hold up over time because of the state\\'s economic growth, although 19,000 residents above the 10 million threshold do technically fall within the margin of error. Regardless of these estimates, Los Angeles County officials said they have long operated on the notion that at least 10 million people have been living here, county spokesman David Sommers said. \"We believe there is a large element of our population that gets missed in counts,\" Sommers said. \"In terms of social services we provide and critical safety-net services the county is responsible for -- providing care and providing services to a level of the population that has nowhere else to turn -- we know we have a very large base and we believe that base to be over 10 million people. It\\'s nice to see that validation from the state.\" L.A. County has seen relatively \"strong growth\" now for two consecutive years for a county of its size, Schooling said. It saw a 0.75 percent increase in population between July 2012 and July 2013 and a 0.85 percent increase the year before, compared with 0.36 percent three years ago, according to state estimates. San Bernardino County, still reeling from the effects of the recession, is also growing but at a slower rate than neighboring Los Angeles and Riverside counties. \"L.A\\'s been growing at a fairly decent clip for the last couple of years,\" Schooling said. \"If you went back to the worst of the (housing) bubble, you would see a much smaller growth. As recently as the 2010-11 period, it was half the rate of (the current) increase.\" \"I think the improving economy is a lot of it, jobs being added and we\\'re also seeing a significant amount of natural increase in L.A. -- more births than deaths,\" which has been the case for many years, Schooling said. Not only is California a highly desirable place to live, the state also has a higher-than-average birth rate due largely to its slightly younger population and a greater share of immigrants, who tend to have more children than U.S.-born women, said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of L.A.-based Beacon Economics. But local experts argue that the overall population growth in L.A. County has still been relatively slow. Typically, the population in the county and the state grows at a faster rate than the nation. However, the state and the L.A. Metropolitan area slipped into a much more severe recession than the nation as a whole, which reversed that trend, said Robert Kleinhenz, chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. California saw a population growth rate of about 0.9 percent this year compared to last year while the national rate is about the same. \"The fact that the local economy is lagging in its recovery compared to the state, compared to the nation, I think is having an adverse impact on our net migration and our overall population growth rate,\" Kleinhenz said. \"As the local economy improves next year, which is what we expect, we\\'ll probably see some acceleration in net migration and the decision to have children.\" L.A. County grew the most in 1986 when it saw an increase of 182,228 people over the previous year. This year, there was an estimated increase of 74,000 people over 2012, Schooling said. Contributing to the growth is that the number of births has exceeded the number of deaths in L.A. County by more than 70,000 people a year in recent years. Immigration is also driving the population increase. While many people move from the Los Angeles area to other parts of the state, relatively high rates of immigration counterbalances that, Schooling said. In the last two years, more people have moved into L.A. County than out of it but that wasn\\'t the case three years ago and during the housing crisis, Schooling said. Meanwhile, in San Bernardino County, the population grew by nearly 0.6 percent this year to an estimated 2.08 million people. More people have been leaving the county than coming into it for years and it lost more than 6,000 people in 2013 to net migration. \"San Bernardino hasn\\'t completely grown out of the economic doldrums yet,\" Schooling said. \"I think they are working on it. They are still growing but we haven\\'t seen the huge growth in the Inland Empire that we have seen in previous times yet.\" ___ Los Angeles County First In U.S. To Reach 10 Million People',\n",

Each level provides a handful of rewards based on which level you have achieved, but it appears that’s not the only thing higher players are receiving. Despite the advantage of acquiring higher level Pokémon in the wild and through evolution, there is something quite annoying that players over level 20 are having to encounter on a frequent basis. It looks like the game is making everything more difficult to catch, including those pesky low level Pidgeys and Rattatas. It seems that these pocket monsters are starting to master the art of breaking out of Poké Balls; I guess they didn’t get the memo that the game is not necessarily a catch and release sport. Redditor Riggnaros reached level 30 before most of the other players in the game, and he has been discussing this issue, among others, such as scaling the amount of XP earned and Pokémon diversity: I dont know how their formula works, obviously, but I can promise you that once you hit mid 20s, you will start to notice even the most common of Pokemon have an abnormally high chance to evade capture. In no scenario should a 10cp Pidgey/Ratatta/Weedle be able to avoid capture from a lvl 29 Pokemon trainer, much less avoid it 5-8 times in the same battle (no exaggeration). From level 29-30 I went through over 1000 Pokeballs. Literally. I cannot stress how ridiculous this would be for someone playing w/o spending coins on Pokeballs (ie playing the game f2p – which is the majority). If they are expecting players to sit around and camp Pokestops for HOURS just to have enough ammo to grind their half a million xp (the requirement from 30-31, 500k), they need to rethink their approach. As a frequent player of Pokémon GO, I’m about to hit level 20 and I can already see a huge difference in the ability to hang onto my catches. Even with the use of Razz Berries and Great Balls, Venonats and Weedles still break free constantly, even with near perfect ball tosses coupled with impeccable timing. I’ve wasted tons of Poké Balls, Razz Berries, and patience trying to obtain the small amount of XP and Stardust for successful catches, and I’m starting to wonder if it’s worth throwing over 5 or 6 Poké Balls for each \"easy\" catch.

              "  'context': 'With its fantastical realms and motley cast of supernatural miscreants, World of Warcraft broke new ground in multiplayer online role-playing computer games, and has now spawned the most successful computer game movie adaptation of all time. After its second weekend at the box office, Warcraft: The Beginning has recouped $377.6 million globally, despite bombing in the U.S. The movie received a meager 32% on metacritic.com and took just $24.4 million in its first five days in American cinemas, and dropped a whopping 73% on its second weekend, bringing in a paltry $6.5 million. Yet the movie remains a financial triumph almost entirely owed to its showing in China, where cinema-goers have so far shelled out more than $200 million on it, even eclipsing Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which took $125.4 million in its entire run in China. Movie experts hail Warcraft’s success as demonstrating the power of China’s booming cinema. Box office revenues grew by almost 50% in China last year and may even surpass the U.S. by as early as next year. There are plans afoot to double the nation’s 35,000 cinema screens before long. (The U.S. currently has just over 40,000.) This trend has the potential to radically reshape how Hollywood operates. But while there is no denying the burgeoning power of Chinese film fans, assessing Warcraft’s success requires more nuance. Just like in the U.S., the movie dropped off massively after its opening — netting $156 million over its first five days and the next $40 million-odd over spread over more than a week. That suggests that the Warcraft movie may not have broad appeal among Chinese; instead, its success appears to be largely owed to the nation’s sizeable and dedicated gamer following. \"I have watch the Warcraft movie five times, and I will never forget my obsession and my friends who fought by my side in Warcraft,\" posted one user of China’s Twitter-like microblog Weibo. \"I had fun, also lost myself in World of Warcraft. I have lived in one more world than most people.\" Since its launch in 2004, WoW, as it’s better known to fans, has drawn over 100 million players — a record for a role-playing computer game. Half of the current five-million-strong playing roster resides in China, where the game is aptly know as \"World of Magic Beasts.\" They are typically young men aged 15-25. \"I can still remember me and my roommates in college staying up late and playing Warcraft together,\" posted another fan. \"We were really bonding through this game. The success of Warcraft is not because how good the movie is, but it represents the years of our burning passions, and the unforgettable brotherhood.\" died after a marathon, 19-hour session. WoW is so popular that there are Chinese kids regularly get so hooked on WoW that they forget to eat, drink or sleep — one player evenafter a marathon, 19-hour session. WoW is so popular that there are professional players who are treated like movie stars, complete with sponsorship deals with fawning groupies. There are Chinese boot camps set up especially for kids who suffer from role-player game addiction. This obsession with role-playing escapism could have much to do with the highly regimented lives led by middle-class Chinese kids, who cope with enormous pressure. Due to China’s only recently rescinded One-Child Policy , many are only children, and are solely relied upon to support their aging parents and grandparents. This month, 9.4 million Chinese kids took the gaokao — China’s university entrance exam equivalent to America’s SAT — yet there were only 3 million college places up for grabs, and only a small fraction of those were at \"top-tier\" institutions. Exam-related suicide is so common that one school even installed special barriers to prevent students flinging themselves to their deaths. Adulthood doesn’t bring respite. Deviant behavior massively jeopardizes career advancement in a one-party state where every citizen has a dangan, or personal file, that lists their misdeeds from their entry into public life — typically enrollment at elementary school — until their death. In this suffocating world, WoW’s appeal is in having complete, uncompromising control over a fantasy, where a player can be as brazen, shocking and nonconformist as their imaginations can stretch. \"Even though young [Chinese] people would like to care about political and historical issues, their choices are limited,\" Zhou Xiaozheng, a retired professor of sociology at Beijing’s Renmin University, tells TIME. \"So they indulge themselves in entertainment.\" There’s a Dark Side to the Warcraft Movie’s Epic Success in China',\n",

But next year’s hotspot just may trounce them both with its mix of stunning beaches, historic towns, vibrant cities and lush islands.  Yup, one particular country has been cropping up on list after list after list of predictions for the 2017 travel year: It’s Portugal, the destination of your most stunningly beautiful dreams. Portugal has long been popular with travelers clued into its adventurous nature activities, historic cities and famous wine. But it looks like visitors will be stopping over even more in 2017: Travel + Leisure recently named Portugal its Destination of the Year, calling attention to the fact that U.S. travel to Portugal increased 22 percent in the last 12 months. The travel experts at Fodor’s put the country’s Minho region on their \"Go List\" for next year, and Lonely Planet calls the Azores one of the world’s best regions to visit in 2017. Skift reports Portugal’s tourism \"boom\" shows \"no signs of slowing,\" as European visitors head there in droves. It’s safe to say we’ll be hearing LOTS about Portugal in 2017. Some highlights to consider for your forthcoming to-see list: A first-timer’s trip to Portugal should include the capital city of Lisbon, which gets plenty of attention for its scenic day hikes and scene-y nightlife. A 2.5-hour drive brings you to the Algarve, Portugal’s equally popular coastal region, where you can search for the perfect hidden beach.   Fodor’s calls Minho the most beautiful part of the country, with a national park that sounds straight out of a fairytale. This stunning river valley also turns out an incredible (and cheap!) local wine. If buzzy Lisbon sounds like too much action, Comporta will be your best friend. This uncrowded fishing village is a hit with Europe’s rich and famous. Lisbon’s stunning Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology opened in October with a building design that will make architecture fans swoon. It’s just one of several top-notch museums in the area. Dubbed the \"next Iceland,\" these increasingly popular islands some 800 miles off the coast won’t be a secret much longer.

However, even though this ride isn’t actually open yet, technical rehearsals have been going on in the past few days, which have given a lucky few an advance look at this attraction Interestingly, praise for the attraction on a technical level has been near universal (no pun intended), with many lauding the attraction’s amazing King Kong animatronic (which you can learn more about here). However, there was one issue that has been causing a lot of controversy in the theme park community: the queue. Now something as simple as a line might not seem like such a big cause for issue, but there’s one big thing that will separate this line from any other at an Orlando theme park.... Editor’s note: some elements of the Skull Island: Reign of Kong queue are discussed here, so if you want to experience this attraction completely unspoiled, turn back now! There will be scareactors in the queue Anyone who has ever been to Halloween Horror Nights knows all about scareactors, who roam the streets of Universal Studios Florida and hang out in haunted mazes waiting for the perfect time to jump out and give guests a fright. And while this type of guest interaction was previously confined to Halloween Horror Nights, it looks like guests who enter the interior part of the Skull Island: Reign of Kong queue will be subjected to some \"natives\" of Skull Island that will be hidden at strategic points in the queue and will be surprising unsuspecting guests. This is certainly an interesting development for a number of reasons. First of all, this will be the closest thing to a year round haunt Universal Orlando Resort has ever had. Interestingly, west coast counterpart Universal Studios Hollywood had a year round haunt with Universal’s House of Horrors for over a decade before that attraction closed down in 2014 and it will have another year round haunt later this year when The Walking Dead attraction opens. However, this will be a first for Orlando. Another reason why this new addition is especially noteworthy is it continues Universal’s recent trend of making queues a legitimate part of the attraction they are placed in front of. Back in 2010 when Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey opened, guests were stunned by the Hogwarts castle queue, and to this day guests who prefer not to ride the attraction can request a \"Castle Tour\" just so they can see the queue. Though this development sounds great on the surface, there are some that are wary of this change, for some very legitimate reasons Skull Island: Reign of Kong Just Became the Most Controversial Ride in Orlando.

              "  'context': 'WASHINGTON -- In September, Rep. Trey Radel voted for Republican legislation that would allow states to make food stamp recipients pee in cups to prove they\\'re not on drugs. In October, police busted the Florida Republican on a charge of cocaine possession. \"It’s really interesting it came on the heels of Republicans voting on everyone who had access to food stamps get drug tested,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told BuzzFeed Tuesday. \"It’s like, what?\" The House over the summer approved an amendment by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) that would let states drug test people on food stamps. The amendment passed by voice vote, meaning members\\' individual yeas and nays were not recorded. Radel later voted in favor of a broader food stamps bill that included Hudson\\'s measure. In support of his drug testing legislation, Hudson cited the many state legislatures around the country that had considered similar requirements for other means-tested programs in recent years. \"This is a clear and obvious problem in our communities as nearly 30 states have introduced legislation to drug test for welfare programs,\" Hudson said. \"We have a moral obligation to equip the states with the tools they need to discourage the use of illegal drugs.\" Most of the state legislation was authored by Republicans. Oftentimes, state Democrats responded by suggesting lawmakers should be subject to tests as well. If the government\\'s going to make sure recipients of taxpayer-funded benefits are clean, the argument went, then why not also make sure the recipients of taxpayer salaries are clean, too? In June, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) made that very suggestion when he questioned why recipients of crop insurance and other government benefits weren\\'t also targeted for drug tests like people on food stamps. \"Why don\\'t we drug test all the members of Congress here,\" McGovern said shortly before the drug-testing measure passed. \"Force everybody to go urinate in a cup or see whether or not anybody is on drugs? Maybe that will explain why some of these amendments are coming up or why some of the votes are turning out the way they are.\" The fate of the food stamp drug testing provision is in the hands of a House-Senate conference committee hashing out differences between food stamp and farm legislation that passed the two chambers. It\\'s got a chance. Last year, Congress passed a law to let states drug-test some unemployment insurance recipients. Radel apologized Tuesday for his cocaine bust and said he\\'d seek treatment. \"I struggle with the disease of alcoholism, and this led to an extremely irresponsible choice,\" he said.

Though the firm beat in fixed income, currencies, and commodities, or FICC, trading revenues, which were up 20% from the same quarter a year ago, it was still down significantly for the first half of the year. What\\'s more telling is what the bank had to say about it: \"Although market-making conditions generally improved compared with the first quarter of 2016, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution continued to operate in a challenging environment characterized by low interest rates, political uncertainty and concerns about global growth,\" the firm said. The words \"challenging environment\" are key. If things were looking positive, the firm most likely would have avoided that language. At the same time, equities trading, which is arguably as important to Goldman Sachs as fixed income, missed expectations and was down 12% year-over-year. The firm said that was driven by lower revenues in cash products and derivatives in Asia, plus securities services, which saw slightly lower revenues. \"During the quarter, the operating environment for equities was impacted by lower levels of client activity, lower market volumes, and a decline in volatility compared with the first quarter of 2016,\" Goldman said. The investment banking outlook wasn\\'t much more optimistic. Investment banking revenues were down 11% for the year because of lower advisory and equity underwriting revenues.

              "  'context': 'Battlefield 1’s Open Beta Leaves us Concerned Ever since its incredibly well-received announcement, DICE has been promising players that Battlefield 1 will let them \"experience the dawn of all-out war\" later this year. On the evening of August 31 st , however, most of us were experiencing nothing but serious connection issues. Within hours of launch, the open beta of Battlefield 1 was KIA by crippling server issues across all platforms. These lasted for around 10 hours and left many unable to connect into the game at all. This, on top of all the problems we encountered once we were finally able to get into the game, has left us (and I’m sure many others) wondering whether DICE and EA are in danger of repeating the same mistakes that led Battlefield 4’s infamously rocky launch. After just two hours of playtime in the Battlefield 1 beta, I’d already encountered dozens of technical problems and glitches, both big and small. At one point, the vehicle that myself and my squad were driving in suddenly just disappeared, leaving us stranded and bewildered, looking at one another in complete shock over what had just occurred. Battlefield 1 also suffers from that classic Battlefield problem of everything feeling slightly out of sync, with delayed responses for grenades (among other things) and sprinting often feeling as though you’re attached held back by a giant bungie cable. With every DICE game, I always think to myself \"next time, they’ll definitely have the resources to ensure that everything work.\" But truth be told, the beta for Battlefield 1 honestly hasn’t left me in high hopes. So that’s the worst stuff out of the way. With regards to pure gameplay, Battlefield 1 is something of a mixed bag. The sound design looks set to be the best it’s ever been; bullets whizz and crack when they fly past your ears, your fellow soldiers scream commands with audible fear, and vehicles roar as they steamroll into battle. Together, it all helps in building a genuine sense of intensity and scale to the combat. While the visuals fail to impress quite as spectacularly as that of DICE’s last title, Star Wars Battlefront, the game’s still a clear frontrunner for the best looking shooter of this holiday season. With open, flat plains and a general lack of visual diversity to it, the Sinai Desert map available in the beta is unlikely to become a series favourite. Here’s hoping that DICE have some more exciting environments in store for the game’s full release. The gunplay itself is spiced up by the World War I era the game is set in. We’re treated to a variety of early 20 th century weapons that provide something of a challenge wrought by the limitations of the time. Sniper rifles, in particular, lack the precision or range of those from the modern age of Battlefield 4, but learning to use them and scoring a headshot feels much more gratifying as a result. There are a number of new features that DICE have brought to Battlefield 1 too, but these tend to be hit-or-miss as well. Horses feel weirdly clunky to ride or score any kills from, and spawning into airborne planes without being able to take off, as was the case in Battlefront, can make the air combat feel like it’s completely separate from the ground war at times. The added ability to charge at foes with your bayonet injects some much needed viability to the melee kills, and also works as a strategic way to cover ground more quickly. In addition, the new \"behemoth\" vehicles, which – in the Sinai Desert – is a fully weaponized train, can act as genuine game changers, ensuring that the momentum against the losing team never accelerates too far. DICE and EA have only a little bit of time to iron out the pretty noticeable kinks of Battlefield 1 before its October 21 st release date, but we’re undoubtedly excited by the prospect of the game’s potential. That potential, at least in the beta, however, is severely hampered by a number of practical issues that could be the game’s undoing.

On Saturday, the \"Firework\" singer took some time from her busy schedule to answer questions from fans on Twitter. When someone asked if she would ever work with Swift, Perry responded with a short and simple answer. \"If she says sorry, sure,\" she said. Twitter The feud between Perry and Swift goes all the way back to 2014, when the latter told Rolling Stone about an unnamed fellow female pop star who \"tried to sabotage an entire arena tour.\" It’s this female pop star that \"Bad Blood\" was written about. \"She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me,\" Swift said. \"And I’m surprisingly non-confrontational – you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It’s awkward, and I don’t like it.\" People on the internet quickly concluded that Swift was talking about Perry, who, soon after that interview was published, tweeted, \"Watch out for the Regina George in sheep’s clothing.\" Perry all but confirmed the tweet was about Swift when she told Billboard in 2015, \"If somebody is trying to defame my character, you’re going to hear about it.\" Swift’s ex Calvin Harris also confirmed the feud between the pop stars when he tweeted about it after his messy breakup from the \"22\" singer. \"I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do,\" Harris wrote, adding, \"I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry.

It was announced a while back that the actor planned to retire from his role as the Adamantium Antihero following one last run in the third and final solo Wolverine movie, which is currently slated to hit theaters next year. Over the course of his career with the X-Men, Jackman became practically synonymous with his character, meaning that it will be nearly impossible for the studio to just hand his role over to a new actor. However, considering how lucrative the hero has proven himself to be in the past, and that Fox hit the big red reset button on the whole universe not that long ago, the studio may already be planning to do just that. Luckily, director Bryan Singer may have a solution that would give the studio all of the high-octane, ticket selling tri-clawed action it wants, while allowing fans to hold on to Jackman’s Logan a little while longer. X-23, A.K.A. Laura Kinney During a recent interview with Fandango, Singer revealed that he has been wanting to bring Logan’s clone to the silver screen for quite a while. \"I have discussed that with the studio. I actually initially pitched the X-Force and the female.\" Last month a casting call went out for Wolverine 3 for a character that sounded very similar to Kinney, leading fans to speculate that the character would appear to fight alongside the current Jackman during his final appearance... barring any possible stunts concerning a certain Wade Wilson, of course. Wolverine 3 is set to hit theaters March of 2017, and you may want to buckle up for this one, kiddos, because Wolvy’s final run will be rated-R.

As the disease continues to ravage West Africa the doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers and first responders have been on the front lines working to stop the epidemic from spreading further. \"This is not simply a historic event that we’re looking back on, but its’ still happening right now,\" Brantly said. \"Ebola fighters are not just people who did something brave and courageous, they are still in the trenches fighting that war as we speak.\" \"Today\" viewers shared Time’s opinion, voting for the Ebola caregivers by a large margin via \"likes\" on \"Today\\'s\" Facebook page.

              "  'context': \"1958 Pan Am inaugurates daily Boeing 707 service across the Atlantic. Something about the human spirit compels us to go faster and farther. That’s why Howard Hughes spent 1935 risking his life flying experimental planes to break speed barriers and why he took even graver risks in 1938 to fly around the world in record time. Hughes had everything to lose—fame, fortune, beautiful girlfriends, some might say his mind—and yet he needed to know what his machines could do. In the decades that followed, crisscrossing the globe turned from a daredevil feat into a regular occurrence. The jet engine had made its way out of the labs and into daily life. These new engines were far more powerful than propellers and allowed airplanes to travel faster and farther and—crucially—to do so reliably. Hughes, Pan Am’s Juan Trippe, and others were quick to seize on the opportunity and built airline empires. The military began ordering fighter jets by the tens of thousands, and companies such as General Electric rushed to meet the demand. By the 1960s this one invention had shrunk the world. For the first time the entire surface of the planet was reachable—or at least viewable—and its wonders opened up. Food, art, leisure, commerce, and relationships were redefined. Life became richer and more hectic. Jet travel created true global citizens while also making it easier to conduct war and spread disease. And yet for all the changes the jet engine brought about, it’s remarkable how static the technology has become. Militaries have developed engines that can break the speed of sound, but the public has benefited little from such work. The Concorde came and went. Boeing spent more than $32 billion to build the 787, which is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than its predecessor but not much faster. GE is filling its engines with sensors and software in the hope of wringing another percentage point of performance here and there. Figures such as Hughes and Trippe have been replaced by low-cost airline execs like Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary, who test the limits of what humans will tolerate rather than what humans can achieve. Some of this is physics, but surely some of it is complacency, too. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. The good news is that there are still people pushing boundaries. Some companies are looking at ways to revive Concorde-type jets and upgrade them with see-through cabins. Elon Musk, the SpaceX and Tesla Motors chief executive officer, wants to build an all-electric supersonic plane that can take off and land vertically. This would allow cities to locate their airports more centrally. Musk has shared his concept with Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and the trio has even talked about one-upping the idea to create passenger craft that could reach space, shaving hours off flight times. Here’s hoping there’s always a young Howard Hughes somewhere willing to give such madness a try. The Jet Engine: No Invention of the Past 85 Years Had a Greater Impact on the World\",\n",

              "  'context': 'The ability to shop for clothing online is a miraculous development of the Internet age, a blessing to women everywhere... except for one thing: A lot of the time, it just really doesn\\'t work. Clothes, particularly hard-to-fit items like pants or bras, are difficult to buy online without trying them on first. So several websites, including Qvit.com, are trying to fix that by making the online shopping process as close to the in-store shopping process as possible. Qvit.com\\'s unique development is the use of personalized avatars, allowing shoppers to \"try on\" clothes on an avatar resembling their exact bodies so they can see how the garments will look and even feel. The idea, says co-founder Laura Pastrana, came when she was in college. Dorming with a \"shopaholic\" friend who \"ordered and returned, ordered and returned everything she bought,\" Laura and her friends couldn\\'t believe there wasn\\'t a better way to see how clothing fit before ordering them online. \"We wanted to have a figure that replicated your body and that allows you to try garments on yourself, so like a virtual you, to see how a garment fits,\" Pastrana said in an interview with HuffPost Style. After years of development, in 2013 they finally came up with an avatar, a custom replica of the shopper\\'s body, that allows her to try clothes in three different ways: 1. \"Mirror Image\" Gives the shopper a straightforward reflection of exactly what she looks like in the clothes, down to her customizable skin color. 2. \"Transparency\" Makes the clothes see-through so the shopper can see how closely or baggily they lay on her body. 3. \"The Heat Map\" Shows how tightly or loosely a garment fits with colors not unlike topography (red means \"so tight you can barely breathe,\" blue means \"there is more than one inch between the item and your body\"). The beauty of a customizable avatar, says Pastrana, is that it doesn\\'t rely on predetermined body \"types\" so often used to guide women\\'s shopping choices, i.e. if you\\'re pear-shaped, buy this; if you\\'re ruler-shaped, buy this. \"We\\'re not looking for what designers believe is the perfect fit,\" Pastrana told HuffPost Style. \"We\\'re rather looking for more of a desired fit, i.e. how I want to take it or how I want to wear it, how it reflects my lifestyle or my look or even my mood.\" She added, \"Sometimes, we women go \\'Today I feel fat\\' or \\'I feel ugly, so I want something more loose.\\' So it\\'s usually not about what fits you exactly as much as what you want to wear.\" Amen to that. Qvit.com, which features a boutique-style selection of clothes for both men and women, ranging from $100 - $400, joins a group of e-commerce ventures such as My Virtual Model and \"Swivel\" by Facecake that aim to improve upon the online dressing room experience. Whether high-tech advancements such as avatars and stop-motion technology will ever make online shopping as appealing and user-friendly as the real life, in-person thing still remains to be seen.

Things started out a little rough on Saturday when she teetered off the balance beam during her Olympic trials, but ever since then, they\\'ve really been looking up. On Sunday she was selected to be one of the five women gymnasts to represent the United States at the Summer Olympics and, maybe even more exciting, on Monday she announced that she\\'s being made into a Barbie. If you need one of these ASAP, it\\'s completely understandable: here\\'s where to buy the Gabby Douglas Barbie before they\\'re gone. Douglas is only 20 years old, but she\\'s already got a huge (and growing) fan club. The world-famous toy company, Mattel, just proved that it\\'s a big fan of Douglas, too. Mattel was founded by a strong, go-getting woman, and the company has always made inspiring young girls to follow their dreams one of its biggest priorities. To that end, the company designed a series of dolls, called \"Shero\" dolls, to spotlight extraordinary, pioneering women. It has made dolls of ballet dancer Misty Copeland, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, and actress Emmy Rossum, according to the Huffington Post. Douglas will join this motley crew with her own, lifelike \"Shero\" doll.  Douglas seems pretty thrilled about the development (who wouldn\\'t be?). She took to Twitter on Monday morning to announce the news. She wrote, \"Excited to debut my @Barbie Shero doll! Let’s continue to break barriers & dream big, girls!\" In the photo she posted, Douglas is at the gym with her Shero doll. They\\'re wearing identical track suits (the doll\\'s is smaller) and she\\'s posing her doll on a to-scale balance beam. It\\'s pretty adorable. When she spoke with People, she expressed how honored she was to be memorialized in Barbie form. She said, \"I’m so excited. My older sister and I used to play with Barbies and create these dramatic fantasy stories, so it’s such a huge honor.\"  Mattel circulated a video interview with Douglas on its Twitter feed that also captured her excitement. She said that she\\'s absolutely \"speechless\" that she has a doll. She added that she \"never would’ve thought in a million years that I would be in this spot. Everyone sees me as a role model and it’s just fantastic.\" Douglas is role model not only for her extreme athleticism (this will be her second time going to the Olympics), but also for her modesty and kindness.  In her interview she also shared how highly she thinks of all young women, no matter their interests and passions. The key, according to Douglas, is acceptance. She said, \"just be you and love yourself and embrace yourself.\"  As for adding this coveted Gabby doll to your collection, it\\'s not for sale yet, but it will be at thebarbiecollection.com.

While the tumor itself was not all that big, the cyst was almost unimaginable. When doctors took a look at her scans, they were floored to find that Olivia’s ovarian cyst had grown to the size of a watermelon. \"The cyst was so huge I thought it was going to pop like a balloon at any moment - and I feared the cancer would spread throughout my body,\" the teen recalled.

              "  'context': 'This article will not restore your faith in humanity. Nor will it amaze, stun, delight, shock, charm, or in any literal or figurative way, blow your mind. What it will do—hopefully in a clear and intelligent way—is explain why people continually fall for clickbait. You know, like you just did a few seconds ago. Whether you think it’s on the rise, obscurant and self-negating, not such a big deal, or the root of all evil, one thing is clear about clickbait: It’s increasingly hard to pin down. Some, like Buzzfeed’s Ben Smith, narrowly define it as an article that doesn’t deliver on its headline’s promise. Others think it means vapid listicles, quizzes, and Betteridge’s Law headlines. And then there are those who simply use it as shorthand for stuff they don’t like on the Internet. Here’s what most people can agree on: Clickbait is annoying, but by god, it works—even when readers recognize it for what it is. The word’s substantial semantic drift may be behind some of this effectiveness. But a hefty helping of behavioral science is at play, too. As a number of new studies confirm, you can blame your clickbait habit on two things: the outsized role emotion plays in your intuitive judgements and daily choices, and your lazy brain. Manufacturing Emotion Clickbait doesn’t just happen on its own. Editors write headlines in an effort to manipulate you—or at least grab your attention—and always have. \"Headless Body In Topless Bar,\" and \"Sticks Nix Hick Pix\" wouldn’t exist if publications didn’t care about attracting eyeballs. The difference with clickbait is you’re often aware of this manipulation, and yet helpless to resist it. It’s at once obvious in its bait-iness, and somehow still effective bait. This has a lot to do with emotion and the role it plays in our daily decision-making processes, says Jonah Berger, who studies social influence and contagion at the University of Pennsylvania. Emotional arousal, or the degree of physical response you have to an emotion, is a key ingredient in clicking behaviors. Sadness and anger, for example, are negative emotions, but anger is much more potent. \"It drives us, fires us up, and compels us to take action,\" Berger says. If you’ve ever found yourself falling for outrage clickbait or spent time hate-reading and hate-watching something, you know what Berger is talking about. \"Anger, anxiety, humor, excitement, inspiration, surprise—all of these are punchy emotions that clickbait headlines rely on,\" he says. A growing body of research supports this idea. In a recent paper called \"Breaking the News: First Impressions Matter On Online News,\" two researchers looked at 69,907 headlines produced by four international media outlets in 2014. After analyzing the sentiment polarity of these headlines (whether the primary emotion conveyed was positive, negative, or neutral), they found \"an extreme sentiment score obtained the largest mean popularity.\" This not only suggests that strongly negative or strongly positive news tends to attract more readers, they concluded, but also that \"a headline has more chance to [receive clicks] if the sentiment expressed in its text is extreme, towards the positive or the negative side.\" Mind the Curiosity Gap Promising a hilarious or mind-blowing experience using hyperbole and superlatives (even when the subject clearly doesn’t warrant such language) is one way to attract clicks. Another is to provoke curiosity. Upworthy articles are particularly good at this and psychologists have a few theories why. One of the more popular and enduring ones comes from Carnegie Mellon’s George Loewenstein. In the mid-1990s, Loewenstein came up with what he called the \"information-gap\" theory. It basically holds that whenever we perceive a gap \"between what we know and what we want to know,\" that gap has emotional consequences. \"Such information gaps produce the feeling of deprivation labeled curiosity,\" he wrote. \"The curious individual is motivated to obtain the missing information to reduce or eliminate the feeling of deprivation.\" In other words, not knowing is cognitively uncomfortable. Historically, this is the thinking behind Upworthy-style \"what happens next\" headlines: \"Someone Gave Some Kids Some Scissors. Here’s What Happened Next\" or \"These Workers Just Want Money, And You Won’t Believe What They Did To Get Some.\" You can make people even more curious, say social psychologists, by presenting them with something they know a little bit about, but not too much. Numbers and Lists Umberto Eco famously claimed that humans are drawn to lists because we’re afraid to die. Psychologists agree. Sort of. As many studies show, lists do a number of things extremely well from a cognitive standpoint, including helping us \"face infinity and attempt to grasp the incomprehensible.\" Here’s a brief list of reasons list headlines are so effective: They often use numbers, and numbers stand out when we’re scrolling through an endless stream of headlines—particularly odd numbers. Those numbers also help quantify story length and hint at the amount of attention (not much) we’ll need to deploy to read the story. They organize information spatially, which is how our brains like information. They feel good, existentially, because they eliminate (or at least downplay) the \"paradox of choice,\" presenting in its stead the illusion of certainty. The takeaway here is that lists ultimately help create an easier reading (and thinking) experience. And there are few things your brain appreciates more than cognitive ease. As Kahneman writes, \"easy is a sign that things are going well—no threats, no major news, no need to redirect attention or mobilize effort.\" \"The 15 Reasons Why You Can’t Resist List Headlines\" promises a pre-defined endpoint and makes the world seem comprehensible. Lists banish mental heavy lifting, complexity, and ambiguity. Click. Anticipation Is Making You Click So clickbait employs a number of effective cognitive tricks to get clicks. Fine. But even if readers rely on emotion and cognitive ease when choosing headlines, that still doesn’t explain why clickbait continues to work. Fool-me-once logic should mean that their effectiveness goes down as exposure goes up. How many cheap emotional ploys, false promises, and empty listicles and quizzes can a person endure? A lot, it turns out. Research has shown that humans are quite willing to put up with massive amounts of disappointment and frustration so long as there’s an occasional payout. And yes, sometimes clickbait does deliver these payouts ... in spectacular fashion. Consider the following headline: \"These 9 Unlikely Animal BFFs Will Brighten Your Day and Melt Your Heart.\" There are hundreds of variations of it online—many of them better from a clickbait POV—but you get the idea. We’re talking baby wombats hugging baby kangaroos, maybe some tiny snow leopard kittens playing with fox cubs, that sort of thing. It’s well established that humans are pre-programmed cute seekers. To our brains’ pleasure centers, there’s little difference between looking at cute animals and consuming sugar or having sex. Indeed, the same neurotransmitter, dopamine, is involved in all three behaviors. That dopamine can manipulate our behavior isn’t news. But the chronology of this process is important when you’re trying to decode clickbait’s effectiveness. Think of those nine adorable animal pics as a reward (your brain certainly does). Now think of that clickbait headline as a signal, an imminent sign you’re about to see some super-adorbz animal buddies. Lastly, think of the actual clicking of the link as the work you have to do to get that outcome. See headline, click hyperlink, receive super-cute reward. Easy. You might assume our brains get that wonderful squirt of dopamine after we get the reward (the pics), but it turns out dopamine levels go up much sooner—when we see the signal. That effectively means the headline itself is what gave you pleasure—not for what it was, mind you, but for what it represented (impending cuteness in 3...2...1). Stanford neuroscientist Robert Sopolsky summarizes the finding this way: \"Dopamine is not about pleasure; it’s about the anticipation of pleasure. It’s about the pursuit of happiness rather than happiness itself.\" Happiness in Slavery What’s really interesting is what happens when you reduce the reward frequency. When it comes only 50 percent of the time, dopamine levels go through the roof. In this sense, a violated promise isn’t a deterrent for clicking behavior, but rather an incentive. As Sopolsky says, \"you’ve just introduced the word ‘maybe’ into the equation, and maybe is addictive like nothing else out there.\" Psychologists call this intermittent reinforcement, and it basically means that one of the most effective ways to get a specific behavior out of a person is to introduce \"perhaps\" into the equation. Now obviously not all clickbait can—or even attempts to—manipulate our dopamine levels. But given its involvement in emotional arousal, it’s fair to say it does factor. This complicates the overpromise/underdeliver argument many people use to predict clickbait’s waning effectiveness. Indeed, on a rational level you may know that the adorable girl in this Clickhole video is right: you’ll still feel alone no matter how many videos you watch or how many lists you read. But behavioral science also suggests that reading about the 25 most awkward cat sleeping positions can also be an effective, if ever so brief, antidote to your existential isolation.

As head of one of America’s largest independent financial research firms, Mr. Stansberry’s work back in 2008 led him to a bold, but worrisome, conclusion: He predicted that the world’s largest mortgage bankers–Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which at the time were responsible for nearly 50% of all the mortgages in America–would soon go bankrupt. In fact, in June of 2008, while their stock prices were still trading at well over $20 per share, Stansberry published a report to his customers titled: \"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Are Going to Zero.\" Inside this report, Stansberry explained: \"For those of you who don’t work in the financial industry, it might be hard for you to immediately grasp what’s so dangerous about the extreme amount of leverage employed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Let me explain exactly what Fannie and Freddie do and why they’re in so much jeopardy...\" We all know what happened next. Both agencies went bust—and if not for a bailout from the Federal Government, both would have declared bankruptcy. Barron’s – America’s second biggest financial newspaper – even wrote a story about Mr. Stansberry’s accurate prediction, and called it \"remarkably prescient\" Over the years, Mr. Stansberry has made a name for himself by accurately predicting the biggest and most important collapses in America. A few others he’s accurately identified well in advance include: General Motors, General Growth Property (America’s biggest mall owner), D.R. Horton (a homebuilder), and Gannett newspapers, to name just a few. Stansberry also predicted the recent collapse of oil and natural gas prices as early as 2010, when he wrote a report titled: \"Peak Oil is a Flat Lie.\" As Mr. Stansberry writes: \"No one believed me years ago when I said the world’s largest mortgage bankers would soon go bankrupt. And no one believed me when I said GM would fall apart... or that the same would happen to General Growth Properties. But that’s exactly what happened.\" And, that brings us to today...

Masturbating in public is not a crime, the Italian supreme court has ruled, even if it is done so with the clear aim of being seen by other members of the public. Italy’s highest court, La Corte di Cassazione, was asked to rule on the case of a 69-year-old man who had been caught masturbating in the southern city of Catania. Identified only as Pietro L, the man had been convicted after he was seen \"taking out his penis\" and \"practising autoeroticism\" in front of students at the University of Catania campus. Italy’s baby-making campaign has not got its intended response According to the local edition of La Repubblica, the local Prefect of Catania and the Court of Appeal had agreed that the man should be sentenced to three months in prison and fined €3,420. But supreme court judges said that a recent government reform meant \"the act is not included in the law as a crime\". In doing so, the court has eliminated the criminal aspects of sentencing for obscene acts in public places. The case of Pietro L will now go back to the Prefect of Catania to be sentenced again. La Corte di Cassazione ruled the man must be given a fine between €5,000 and €30,000, with the exact figure to be determined by the local court. In taking their decision, the supreme court judges noted the fact that the Italian parliament passed a law last year decriminalizing the offence of lurking in places frequented by girls in order to be seen masturbating.

              "  'context': 'Jeff Guo\\'s digital avatar watches TV on fast-forward. (Dani Johnson, Amy King / The Washington Post) I HAVE a habit that horrifies most people. I watch television and films in fast forward. This has become increasingly easy to do with computers (I’ll show you how) and the time savings are enormous. Four episodes of \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" fit into an hour. An entire season of \"Game of Thrones\" goes down on the bus ride from D.C. to New York. I started doing this years ago to make my life more efficient. Between trendy Web shows, auteur cable series, and BBC imports, there’s more to watch than ever before. Some TV execs worry that the industry is outpacing its audience. A record-setting 412 scripted series ran in 2015, nearly double the number in 2009. \"There is simply too much television,\" FX Networks CEO John Landgraf said last year. Nonsense, responded Netflix content chief Ted Sarandos, who has been commissioning shows at a startling rate. \"There’s no such thing as too much TV,\" he said. So here we are, spending three hours a day on average, scrambling to keep up with the Kardashians, the Starks, the Underwoods, and the dozens of others on the roster of must-watch TV, which has exploded in the age of fragmented audiences. Nowadays, to stay on the same wavelength with your different groups of friends — the ones hating on \"Meat Chad\" and the ones cooing over Khaleesi — you have to watch in bulk. This is where the trick of playing videos at 1.5x to 2x comes in — the latest twist in the millennia-old tradition of technology changing storytelling. The concept should be familiar to many. For years, podcast and audiobook players have provided speedup options, and research shows that most people prefer listening to accelerated speech. In recent years, software has made it much easier to perform the same operation on videos. This was impossible for home viewers in the age of VHS. But computers can now easily speed up any video you throw at them. You can play DVDs and iTunes purchases at whatever tempo you like. YouTube allows you select a speedup factor on its player. And a Google engineer has written a popular Chrome extension that accelerates most other Web videos, including on Netflix, Vimeo and Amazon Prime. Over 100,000 people have downloaded that plug-in, and the reviews are ecstatic. \"Oh my God! I regret all the wasted time I\\'ve lived before finding this gem!!\" one user wrote. But speeding up video is more than an efficiency hack. I quickly discovered that acceleration makes viewing more pleasurable. \"Modern Family\" played at twice the speed is far funnier — the jokes come faster and they seem to hit harder. I get less frustrated at shows that want to waste my time with filler plots or gratuitous violence. The faster pace makes it easier to appreciate the flow of the plot and the structure of the scenes. Wonkblog writer Jeff Guo watches all his television shows at 160% speed. This clip from ABC\\'s Modern Family will give you an idea of what that looks like. (ABC) As I’ve come to consume all my television on my computer, I’ve developed other habits, too. I don\\'t watch linearly anymore; I often scrub back and forth to savor complex scenes or to skim over slow ones. In other words, I watch television like I read a book. I jump around. I re-read. Sometimes I speed up. Sometimes I slow down. I confess these new viewing techniques have done something strange to my sense of reality. I can’t watch television in real-time anymore. Movie theaters feel suffocating. I need to be able to fast-forward and rewind and accelerate and slow down, to be able to parcel my attention where it\\'s needed. The most common objection I hear is that this ruins the cinematic experience. Annette Insdorf, a film professor at Columbia, told me: \"Sometimes watching a movie is like lovemaking: Isn\\'t a sustained seduction more gratifying than momentary thrills?\" But the more I\\'ve learned about the history and the science of media consumption, the more I\\'ve come to believe this is the future of how we will appreciate television and movies. We will interrogate videos in new ways using our powers of time manipulation. Maybe not everyone will watch on fast-forward like I do, but we will all be watching on our own terms. In a way, what\\'s happening to video recalls what happened to literature when we stopped reading aloud, together, and started reading silently, alone. Beginning in the Middle Ages, people no longer had to gather in groups to hear tales or learn the news or study religion. They could be alone with a text and their own thoughts, an unprecedented freedom that led to political and religious turmoil and forever changed intellectual life. With computers, video consumption is also becoming a solitary, self-paced act — and maybe a more analytical act, as well. If you believe, as I do, in the artistic potential of television and film, then perhaps we are on the brink of another cultural transformation — viewers finally seizing control of this medium. And the medium will be better for it. FOR a very long time, life was limited by the rate at which we spoke. Although we have had writing systems for millennia, early texts were designed to be read aloud, meaning that literature unfolded at the pace of human speech. Many ancient Greek and Roman documents, for instance, lacked punctuation, spaces or lowercase letters, making it challenging for people to understand them without sounding out the words syllable by syllable. \"A written text was essentially a transcription which, like modern musical notation, became an intelligible message only when it was performed orally to others or to oneself,\" historian Paul Saenger writes. There are physical limits to how quickly we can form sounds, as anyone who has attempted a tongue-twister can attest. Mouths need time to move into position for the next vowel or consonant. A good estimate for the natural rate of speech in English is 200 to 300 syllables per minute, which translates into 150 to 200 words per minute. According to Audible, the audiobook company, the typical book recording is performed at 155 wpm. A 1990 study found that radio broadcasts run at 160 wpm on average, while everyday conversations, which use shorter words, occur at about 210 wpm. For much of human history, this was the sound barrier for communicating ideas. It’s not that silent reading was impossible in antiquity. It was just very difficult. There exist tales of scholars who seemed to absorb books silently; in the fourth century, Saint Augustine told of an odd monk who read without forming the words with his mouth. \"When he read,\" Augustine wrote, \"his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still.\" Historians debate whether these silent readers were regarded as freaks or the practice was merely unusual. Reading was still a group activity in the fifth and sixth centuries. One person read aloud while others listened. Even for scribes who copied manuscripts in solitude, the act of reading was intertwined with the act of speaking. Many early medieval monks who had taken vows of silence were still allowed to mumble as they read, Saenger writes, because mumbling was considered part of the reading process. During the Middle Ages, scribes began introducing spacing and punctuation into texts, which made silent reading much easier for everyone. The practice began in monasteries around the 10th century and slowly spread to university libraries a few hundred years later, and finally to the European aristocracy by the 14th and 15th centuries, according to historian Roger Chartier. The technique of silent, solitary reading released people from the sluggishness of the spoken word — as well as from the judgment of their peers. Reading in private gave people room to engage with a text, the freedom to think critically and sometimes heretically. Opinions too controversial for group reading could be disseminated and consumed in private. The result, historians say, was an intellectual, scientific — and spiritual — blossoming in Europe. \"Silent, secret, private reading paved the way for previously unthinkable audacities,\" Chartier writes. \"In the late Middle Ages, even before the invention of the printing press, heretical texts circulated in manuscript form, critical ideas were expressed, and erotic books, suitably illuminated, enjoyed considerable success.\" Chartier called silent reading the \"other revolution\" — together with the printing press and mass literacy, these developments created both the demand and the supply for a vast quantity of writing. The faster pace of silent reading accelerated the spread of new ideas and vaulted Western society toward religious and political schism. \"This ‘privatization’ of reading is undeniably one of the major cultural developments of the early modern era,\" Chartier argued. WHAT silent reading also revealed was that the rate of human thought far outstrips the rate of human speech. Broadcasters speak at about 160 wpm, but college students can comfortably devour a text at 300 wpm, which also seems to be the most efficient speed for reading comprehension, on average. Some people, of course, read slower, and others read much, much faster. The beauty of text is that we absorb it at our own pace. Not so for audiovisual recordings, at least not for much of the 20th century. If you play back a tape or a phonograph record too quickly, the voices turn squeaky and unintelligible. Recordings remained difficult to skim until the 1950s, when researchers made a set of discoveries about human speech. It turns out that sounds of the spoken word are vastly redundant. Vowels and consonants drag on longer than necessary for us to understand them. In the late 1940s, Harvard researchers discovered they could cover up more than half of a speech recording without damaging a listener’s comprehension. The trick was to rapidly mute and unmute the audio. These silent gaps were brief enough that people’s minds could fill them in easily. Words sounded choppy, but they remained perfectly intelligible. \"It is much like seeing a landscape through a picket fence,\" the researchers wrote. \"The pickets interrupt the view at regular intervals, but the landscape is perceived as continuing behind the pickets.\" The Harvard researchers rapidly muted and unmuted audio recordings. The top picture shows the original sound wave. The bottom picture shows the resulting sound wave, which has silent bits. Even though half of the sound wave has been destroyed, the researchers found that people could still understand it. (Miller and Licklider, 1950.) A team of engineers at the University of Illinois soon had another idea: Instead of leaving the gaps in, why not cut them out and stitch the remaining slivers of audio together? For instance, deleting every other millisecond of audio would cause the recording to play in half the time. This new way of speeding up sound, which became known as the sampling method, had the benefit of not making people sound like chipmunks. In the 1960s, a blind psychologist named Emerson Foulke began experimenting with this technique to accelerate speech. A professor at the University of Louisville, Foulke was frustrated with the slowness of recorded books for the blind, so he tried speeding them up. The sampling method proved surprisingly effective. In Foulke’s experiments, speech could be accelerated to 250-275 wpm without affecting people’s scores on a listening comprehension test. These limits were suspiciously close to the average college reading rate. Foulke suspected that beyond 300 wpm, deeper processes in the brain were getting overloaded. Experiments showed that at 300-400 wpm, individual words were still clear enough to understand; except at that rate, many listeners couldn’t keep up with rapid stream of words, likely because their short-term memories were overtaxed. Some, of course, fared better than others. Just as people naturally read at different rates, subjects varied in how well they could understand accelerated speech. Further studies found a connection to cognitive ability. Those with higher intelligence, as well as faster readers, were more adept at understanding sped-up recordings. (The NSA once considered using tests involving accelerated speech to screen for people who could become morse code operators.) The most startling discovery, though, was that people actually enjoy listening to accelerated audio. Foulke and his colleagues noticed that college students preferred recordings that had been sped up by 30 percent, from 175 wpm to 222 wpm. More recent studies find that, given the choice, people will increase playback rate by about 40 to 50 percent on average — a 1.4 to 1.5x speedup. This tendency extends to video as well, as experiments with video lectures and even Discovery Channel shows have shown. Increasing the tempo of a recording seems to stave off boredom and help people stay engaged. \"With the slower pace, my attention span actually wavered, and I focused on too much detail,\" one subject told researchers at Microsoft. Sometimes, people don\\'t even notice that they are watching on fast-forward. Cable companies will slightly speed up shows to make room for more ads, but the difference can be hard to detect — in part because the brain adapts to the higher speeds. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Defense Department began investigating compressed speech as a way to boost learning. Military-funded experiments showed that people can be trained to better understand accelerated recordings. Just a few weeks of regular exposure seemed to alter how people perceived and processed language, causing them to prefer faster and faster listening rates. Some of those changes happen within minutes. An experiment in 1997 found that listening to just five sentences of accelerated speech boosted subsequent comprehension rates by 15 percent. This process may be related to how our brains adjust to unfamiliar accents. Have you ever noticed that it becomes easier and easier to talk to someone with a foreign accent? It’s not them. It’s your brain making short-term adaptations. Our brains also make long-term adaptations to accelerated speech. Continued training increases people’s accuracy rates and their comfort with sped-up recordings. Functional MRI scans show changes in how their brains respond to speech. Anecdotally, many subjects found that repeated exposure to accelerated speech caused speech at regular speeds to sound strange. This seems to have happened to me as well. After watching accelerated video on my computer for a few months, live television began to seem excruciatingly slow. Ilya Grigorik, the Google engineer who invented the Chrome extension, had a similar experience. He regularly watches videos at double speed, adjusting the pace up or down depending on how complex the ideas are. \"Whenever I describe it to people, I get a very weird look,\" he said. \"Then I actually convince them to try it. It’s uncomfortable for them at first, but once they get into it, they really get into it.\" WE all chart our own paths through a text. I rarely read a book straight through from start to finish. I take detours, I backtrack, and I always scan the plot summary on Wikipedia to learn what\\'s coming next. Psychologists at the University of California, San Diego have found that people enjoy a story more if the ending has already been spoiled. Suspense, it seems, is overrated. The Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov believed that re-reading was the only way to truly enjoy a novel. Not until the second or third go-around can we perceive a novel’s grand schemes and secrets. Of the initial encounter, he once said: \"When we read a book for the first time, the very process of laboriously moving our eyes from left to right, line after line, page after page, this complicated physical work upon the book, the very process of learning in terms of space and time what the book is about, this stands between us and artistic appreciation.\" There\\'s no one right way to enjoy a book. Literary theorist Roland Barthes encouraged us not to treat novels so literally or linearly, but to traipse around in search of our own meanings. Why, then, do we still watch television straightforwardly? Why do we relinquish ourselves to the pace set by a film’s director? Can\\'t we find more interesting ways to be a couch potato? For a long time, the answer was that the technology did not allow it. But with the rise of computer viewing, everyone can take charge of how they travel through a video. I often consume reality programs at double speed or faster because the idioms of these shows are so familiar. For me, watching \"The Bachelorette\" is like shucking a crab. I know where the juicy bits are, and I know which parts are inedible. Accelerated speeds make it easier to perceive the structure of a story; slower speeds allow me to savor the details of the filmmaking. These alternative styles of viewing are no less illuminating. At double speed, the Red Wedding scene from \"Game of Thrones\" crosses the threshold from high drama to high farce. You start to see how the directors strained to create a moment of maximum trauma, how the death scenes are overacted, how the massacre operates like the mechanical gnashings of a meat-processing plant. Wonkblog writer Jeff Guo watches all his television shows at 160% speed. This clip from HBO\\'s Game of Thrones will give you an idea of what that looks like. (HBO) I recently described my viewing habits to Mary Sweeney, the editor on the cerebral cult classic \"Mulholland Drive.\" She laughed in horror. \"Everything you just said is just anathema to a film editor,\" she said. \"If you don\\'t have respect for how something was edited, then try editing some time! It\\'s very hard.\" Sweeney, who is also a professor at the University of Southern California, believes in the privilege of the auteur. She told me a story about how they removed all the chapter breaks from the DVD version of Mulholland Drive to preserve the director’s vision. \"The film, which took two years to make, was meant to be experienced from beginning to end as one piece,\" she said. I disagree. Mulholland Drive is one of my favorite films, but it\\'s intentionally dreamlike and incomprehensible at times. The DVD version even included clues from director David Lynch to help people baffled by the plot. I advise first-time viewers to watch with a remote in hand to ward off disorientation. Liberal use of the fast-forward and rewind buttons allows people to draw connections between different sections of the film. I found something of a sympathetic ear in Peter Markham, who teaches directing at the American Film Institute Conservatory. \"This notion of privacy, of watching privately and forming your own cathedral of narrative — that’s interesting,\" he said. \"But that, I think, is mostly an intellectual or cerebral experience. The thing about dramatic narrative is that it creates an emotional, visceral, subconscious experience. That stuff has its own rhythm, its own insistence.\" Markham argued that film is more than a stream of dialogue or a sequence of events. The timing of the images imprints on our brains in a special way. \"If you speed up Hitchcock, if you speed up \"Rear Window,\" you won’t get the same experience,\" he said. \"It’s like trying to speed up a Beyoncé track. It’s already at the perfect speed.\" IT didn’t occur to me until later, of course, that people do mess with Beyoncé all the time. DJs chop her up, stretch her over new beats, snatch bits of her vocals to craft new songs. Today’s cinema fans also engage in forms of creative remixing. They assemble montages of their favorite characters. They create entirely original shows by re-editing scenes from ones. The actor Topher Grace, for instance, famously made his own unauthorized version of the \"Star Wars\" prequel movies called \"Episode III.5: The Editor Strikes Back.\" Those who have seen it say it\\'s a masterful recombobulation of those three flawed films. Henry Jenkins, a media theorist at the University of Southern California, reminded me that creative repurposing has been happening in fan communities for decades. Throughout his career, Jenkins has studied the rise of \"participatory culture\" — ways in which fans take control of favorite stories through fanzines, fan art, fan fiction, and more recently, fan videos. \"Fans reject the idea of a definitive version produced, authorized, and regulated by some media conglomerate,\" Jenkins wrote over a decade ago. \"Instead, fans envision a world where all of us can participate in the creation and circulation of central cultural myths.\" Perhaps fan culture offers the most optimistic vision for the future of media consumption. The power of the auteur is diminishing, but our appreciation for the art form is increasing. More and more, we will watch TV on our computers, on own terms, creating our own meanings and deriving our own, private pleasures. \"I think your experience is very similar to my own,\" Jenkins said. \"I do treat television more and more like a book. I totally get that analogy, and it\\'s a good way to think about the degree of control we now have over what we watch — which has been building up over time, with VCRs, then DVRs, and now streaming and digital distribution. We\\'re learning to think about television in a different way.\" \"I\\'m fully convinced that everything is better in a box set,\" he added. Netflix, which is essentially the motherlode of box sets, has made this kind of careful viewing much easier. That\\'s one reason that serialized shows have become so popular in recent years. Since audiences can easily catch up on missed episodes — many of them are bingewatching anyway — show-runners can tell longer, more complicated stories with less repetition. The rewind button allows television to be a little more sophisticated. If you didn\\'t understand the first time, just watch again. But the spread of solitary, customized viewing will not mean the demise of television culture — quite the opposite. People will watch an episode and dissect it on Twitter; they will share their favorite scenes and watch them on repeat. \"While viewing is becoming a more solitary, personal activity, the flip side is that fan communities have grown stronger,\" Jennifer Holt, a media scholar at the University of California at Santa Barbara, told me. \"People still want to connect. They still want that social experience, only now it\\'s all happening online.\" This practice has expanded the dialogue between the makers and the consumers of television. \"Show creators, writers and directors are now extremely sensitive to what the blogosphere is saying about their shows,\" Paris Barclay, the president of the Directors Guild of America, said a few years ago. Barclay, who has worked on shows such as \"Glee,\" \"Empire\" and \"Scandal,\" was wary of this development. \"Some shows have become increasingly dull because taking risks with the show is discouraged,\" he said. \"Audiences generally want to see a different version of the show that they love. They don’t really want to see it become something else.\" But as Jenkins, the media theorist, points out, creators have always adapted their work to suit who was listening. \"Storytelling is a bardic medium,\" he said. \"Bards like Homer would tell a story to a roomful of people and he would be attentive to what they liked and what they didn\\'t like. The same was true of Dickens, whose novels were published serially. He changed plot points and characters on the fly.\" Now that tools are making it increasingly easy to alter the flow of how we watch films and television, viewers will also have power to change the plot and the characters of a show to suit their own tastes. We should look forward to a future that involves more cross-pollination, more crazy fan-theories, more creative misunderstandings, all of it enabled by new ways of consuming television, whether that means binge-watching, surfing clips on social media or even watching on fast-forward. We risk transforming, perhaps permanently, the ways in which our brains perceive people, time, space, emotion. And isn’t that marvelous?

              "  'context': \"Calling all bakers! You've all mastered the art of making the perfect cake. Frosting, fondant, food coloring, whatever it is, you've done it all. What happens when you're finished though? This is a sprinkle cake platter project that will display all of your kitchen creations the way that they should be! Forewarning.... this is a two-day project, so don’t try to make it happen as a last minute effort on the morning of your big party. Plus, you probably won’t have all the supplies on hand. Here’s a list of what you’ll need. Clear packaging tape Springform pan Cutting board Epoxy resin (cast resin) Craft glue Sprinkles! Hairdryer A round wooden block (or another type of base for the stand) Super Glue Sandpaper Cling wrap (optional) 1. Start by using packaging tape to cover your cutting board so that you have a clean, smooth surface (that will also make for easy cleanup). You could also use clingwrap to cover your surface, but you would need to make sure that it is secured and smooth with no wrinkles or pockets for air. 2. Now, grab your springform pan and set aside the bottom piece, you’ll only need to outer ring for this project. Cover the inside surface of the ring with the same tape you used for the cutting board, trying to make it as smooth as possible. 3. Place the springform ring on top of the cutting board and secure it to the taped surface by using super glue on the inside edge where the pan meets the board. 4. While the super glue is setting, mix the cast resin, following the instructions very carefully. This is the most important step of the project. When you’re ready, pour the mixture into the pan. 5. Now it’s time to make it colorful! Grab whatever color sprinkles you want and add them to the epoxy mixture. Just a heads up, you’re probably not going to have any sprinkles left over from this project for your cake, so make sure to plan accordingly! The sprinkles will settle to the bottom of the glue mixture, so try to spread them out as evenly as possible. Don’t be afraid to get creative! 6. This steps pretty simple. All you have to do is take a hair dryer to the mixture. This will get rid of any air bubbles. 7. Wait 24 hours for the mixture to completely set and dry. Then, simply pull the springform ring from the cutting board, and then pop out the mold. 8. Smooth the uneven edges of the colorful creation with sandpaper. The YouTuber doing the tutorial uses a lathe, if you happen to have one. 9. The last step is to choose a base for the stand. Choose a round block of wood with a wide diameter and secure it to the back of the mold with super glue. 10. Once you have the base secured, flip over the stand and place something heavy on top of it so that the glue really adheres to the mold. 11. Now, your stand is complete and all you have to do is bake your cake! He Dumps Sprinkles Into A Pan With Tons Of Glue. Now It's In His Kitc...\",\n",

To give you a little bit of background on this whole mess, YouTube personality Grace Randolph perpetuated this myth last month when she called upon her fans on Twitter to attack movie critics who dared to even have the unmitigated gaul to compare Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice and Captain America: Civil War when early screenings were going on for Civil War. Important: if u see anyone criticizing #BatmanvSuperman to praise #CaptainAmericaCivilWar call ’em out or don’t click – that will stop it — Grace Randolph (@GraceRandolph) April 14, 2016 Randolph even retweeted something one of her followers sent to her of a critic just saying in her Rotten Tomatoes blurb Captain America: Civil War did a better job balancing fun and seriousness compared to BVS. To those today who told me I was \"delusional\" re critics agenda against #BatmanvSuperman, take a look: https://t.co/60cSGkK3bp — Grace Randolph (@GraceRandolph) April 14, 2016 Randolph also accused via retweet of online personality John Campea of being in the bag for Disney when one of her followers tweeted her a picture of Campea at the Captain America: Civil War premiere. Camp, who liked both Man Of Steel and BVS defended himself on Twitter as well as posting a response video on Youtube. Does this myth have any ground to stand on? Is Disney really greasing the palms of movie critics to make sure the House Of Mouse reigns supreme at the box office? Like the word \"supercalafragalisticexpialadoshus\", this is all nonsense. I’m not saying this because I write for a primarily Disney-themed blog. For the record, I LOVED BVS. I saw it in theaters four times! (Guardians of the Galaxy still holds my personal record of seeing a movie in theaters six times. Starlord forever!) Ben Affleck was the bomb as Batman. I’m saying this because common sense tells you it simply isn’t true. No matter how many times Randolph retweeted a critic comparing BVS and Civil War or how sophisticated the petition tried to sound, there was absolutely no proof at all. You can’t make strong accusations like that and then bring nothing to the table. Why would respected movie critics like Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune or Ty Burr of the Boston Globe compromise their integrity and bring their character into question by accepting bribes from Disney just to give a movie a bad review? Honestly think about that. As much as I loved Batman v Superman, I can see why people didn’t like it at all. The movie seemed to be missing some key plot points (How did Superman know Bruce Wayne was Batman? What exactly was Lex Luthor’s reason for hating Superman? Why was Diana Prince looking at that sword in the museum with Bruce?), the tone was too dark at times and Jesse Eisenberg seemed to be channeling Daffy Duck for his version of Lex. What would Walt Disney Studios have to gain by paying off critics to give their competition bad reviews? They currently have five of the top ten highest grossing films of all time (Star Wars: the Force Awakens, The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Frozen and Iron Man 3) and three of the top five highest grossing films of 2016 so far (Zootopia, Civil War and the Jungle Book). Does that sound like a company in need of bribing? Live look at Disney counting their box office earnings this year. Via Giphy Also, if Disney paid off critics to badmouth their competition, then why did this year’s Deadpool, a Marvel property owned by 20th Century Fox, get such rave reviews and all the money in the world? Wouldn’t Disney make sure the merc with a mouth went down in flames so their Marvel properties ruled the roost at the box office? No, it didn’t happen cause Deadpool is an awesome movie and deserves all the praise it gets. \"Oh my God! Did Keith just totally make sense?\" via Gifsme Now look, I am sure there has always been some funny business going on behind the scenes in the entertainment industry. After all, the radio business was busted with the Payola scandal back in 2005 and the late 50’s. But in those instances, radio stations got incentives to play certain songs and artists; not sideline a record label’s competition. But to say a major movie studio that is THRIVING right now is paying off critics to give their competition bad reviews? No, that’s just not happening. Disney has bigger fish to fry.

              "  'context': 'When my husband and I first came together as a romantic couple three years ago, we agreed to practice Radical Honesty in our relationship, meaning he and I wouldn\\'t keep any secrets from each other bigger than a surprise party. The rule can prove more challenging to abide by than you might suspect at first. But both of us feel it\\'s well worth the occasional angst we experience in order to enjoy a romance that lets us feel totally connected and utterly trusting of each other. What does Radical Honesty mean? It means, quite simply, that you tell the your partner everything that\\'s going on in your life. Everything. Not just where you\\'re going that evening and what you\\'ll be doing at work that day and with whom, but also mentioning when someone you meet gives you butterflies. When you feel an urge to reach out to an ex. When you get overwhelmed with guilt about someone you hurt years ago. It means sharing when someone at the office gets flirtatious with you—even if you don\\'t reciprocate his or her advances. Or telling your partner you find someone—even a movie star—sexy. In sum, it boils down to full disclosure and keeping zero secrets in an attempt to ward off any potential trouble further down the road. My desire for Radical Honesty runs deep. I was married for six years and in a nine-year relationship prior to meeting and marrying my current husband, Kiran. Back then I was married to Sid, who was not the love of my life by any means, but we did have a caring, fun relationship—until it all fell apart. I gradually discovered that Sid had been lying to me. First about small things, like running into an ex at an event and grabbing a quick drink with her. Then about big things, like hitting on a mutual friend of ours, telling her how much he wanted to sleep with her. After we divorced, the walls came tumbling down. Other people shared their stories about Sid. Turns out my ex had been dishonest about who he was at his very core. It took me a long time to forgive him—and myself. What I learned beyond a shadow of a doubt from my first marriage was a gift. I came to see how lies, no matter how tiny, can snowball into grander and far more humiliating deceptions. Lies completely undermined my relationship with Sid; I was not about to allow the same thing to happen with Kiran. Of course, practicing Radical Honesty can be tough. It forces you to confront tough emotions head on. In a society that teaches us to avoid conflict as much as humanly possible, to make amends, smooth things over, and tell white lies, Radical Honesty is the opposite policy. It\\'s all about diving headfirst into sticky situations in the name of love. I\\'ll give you an example. I have promised to tell Kiran whenever I hear from an ex-boyfriend, just as he will tell me whenever an ex-girlfriend contacts him. I personally don\\'t think there\\'s anything worse than glancing at your partner\\'s cellphone when it rings or buzzes and seeing that heart-pounding, knee-shaking, jealousy-inspiring ex\\'s name on the screen. What could more instantly and assuredly inspire a total mental breakdown? At least this way, I know that if Angela or Katy (not their real names) reaches out, Kiran will tell me about it—pronto. And yet in spite of our Radical Honesty commitment, I had trouble practicing it in the early days of our relationship. One day, I got an email from an ex (let\\'s call him Robert) saying that he\\'d be in town, and asking whether I\\'d like to get together for coffee. It was a totally innocent request. Robert knew that I was blissfully married to the love of my life, and he himself was in a new, seemingly happy relationship. Furthermore, we had only spent six months dating, and things had ended amicably when we decided to go our separate ways. But for some reason, I didn\\'t tell Kiran right away. I wrote back to Robert, saying sure, I\\'d be happy to meet up for coffee that weekend. Then I waited. And waited. Again, to be clear, I didn\\'t have any intentions of infidelity or any lingering feelings for Robert. I always was going to tell Kiran about my plans to meet up with my ex. But I didn\\'t act immediately to share the news. I was hiding Robert\\'s request for a meeting from Kiran because the prospect of discussing my ex with my current love made me uncomfortable. I worried that Kiran would get jealous. That it would just upset him. I didn\\'t want to hurt his feelings. I wanted to protect him. Well, keeping Robert\\'s email a secret couldn\\'t possibly have been a worse decision. I should have said something to Kiran right away and asked him if he was okay with the platonic rendezvous. If he had been hurt, if he had gotten jealous, I could\\'ve handled it. If he had said \"No, don\\'t meet Robert for coffee,\" I absolutely would have respected his wishes. But I waited until the day before Robert was coming to town before I said something. When I did, Kiran was upset, wanting to know when I had made these plans. I was honest and admitted it had been several days ago. We got into an argument. In the end, Kiran was far more upset that I had explicitly violated our Radical Honesty rule than he was about Robert contacting me or my agreeing to see Robert for coffee. Kiran felt betrayed that I had kept a secret from him for days. I felt horrible, apologetic, and dishonest. And I ended up canceling on Robert, because repairing my relationship with my one true love was more important to me than making a social visit with an ex. Everyone lost out due to my own reluctance to confront the situation fearlessly and with integrity. On the contrary, every time I have shared my vulnerabilities with Kiran, he has responded with such tenderness and compassion that I am blown away. He meets every embarrassing memory or urge with love, respect and understanding—and I do the same for him. Because of this—our ongoing policy of Radical Honesty—I know beyond a doubt that our marriage will endure. It\\'s not an easy practice, and maybe it never will be, but it works for us.

              "  'context': 'WASHINGTON -- Rep. Lee Terry (R-Neb.) said on Thursday that he is against military intervention in Syria, even though his \"gut feeling\" is that the Syrian government now possesses chemical weapons that came from fallen Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussain. Terry, who has served in the House since 1999, supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. In an interview on Thursday with Omaha radio host Tom Becka, Terry said Syria was a completely different situation. \"The theory then and the evidence was that Iraq was an enemy of the United States and had direct plans in either support of al Qaeda and/or with other weapons that we found out weren’t there -- which I still think they were moved to Syria,\" said Terry. \"And it wouldn’t surprise me if some of the chemical weapons that have been used by Syria actually came from Iraq.\" There is no evidence that Hussein sent weapons of mass destruction to Syria. When Becka asked whether Terry\\'s claim about the transfer of weapons was based on information he had received as a member of Congress, Terry replied, \"Gut feeling. Yeah, I have not had any classified briefing, but all we know that Iraq had ... chemical and biological weapons and then they weren’t there. ... It wasn’t that the U.S. was guessing; that was something that they had actually declared. But they went someplace.\" Terry, however, is not the first to make this claim; it\\'s been circulating for years among supporters of an invasion. Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney said he believed the transfer was \"entirely possible\" in a 2007 interview. Many proponents of this theory cite an October 2003 statement by James Clapper, Jr., who was leading the National Imagery and Mapping Agency at the time and later became the Director of National Intelligence. \\'\\'I think people below the Saddam Hussein-and-his-sons level saw what was coming and decided the best thing to do was to destroy and disperse,\\'\\' said Clapper, adding that \"the obvious conclusion one draws\" is that there \\'\\'may have been people leaving the scene, fleeing Iraq, and unquestionably, I am sure, material.\" The New York Times noted in 2003 that Clapper had been providing a \"personal assessment,\" and a spokesman for his agency \"could not provide further evidence to support the general\\'s statement.\" In 2005, the CIA’s top weapons inspector in Iraq and head of the Iraq Study Group, Charles Duelfer, said while it was possible there had been such a transfer, they had failed to find any proof of this theory. From the ISG report: The investigation centered on the possibility that WMD materials were moved to Syria. ... ISG found no senior policy, program, or intelligence officials who admitted any direct knowledge of such movement of WMD. Indeed, they uniformly denied any knowledge of residual WMD that could have been secreted to Syria. [...] Based on the evidence available at present, ISG judged that it was unlikely that an official transfer of WMD material from Iraq to Syria took place. However, ISG was unable to rule out unofficial movement of limited WMD-related materials. The ISG also concluded, \"While a small number of old, abandoned chemical munitions have been discovered, ISG judges that Iraq unilaterally destroyed its undeclared chemical weapons stockpile in 1991.\" Rep.

Orthodox... The standard narrative of American religious decline goes something like this: A few hundred years ago, European and American intellectuals began doubting the validity of God as an explanatory mechanism for natural life. As science became a more widely accepted method for investigating and understanding the physical world, religion became a less viable way of thinking—not just about medicine and mechanics, but also culture and politics and economics and every other sphere of public life. As the United States became more secular, people slowly began drifting away from faith. Of course, this tale is not just reductive—it’s arguably inaccurate, in that it seems to Of course, this tale is not just reductive—it’s arguably inaccurate, in that it seems to capture neither the reasons nor the reality behind contemporary American belief. For one thing, the U.S. is still overwhelmingly religious, despite years of predictions about religion’s demise. A significant number of people who don’t identify with any particular faith group still say they believe in God , and roughly 40 percent pray daily or weekly. While there have been changes in this kind of private belief and practice, the most significant shift has been in the way people publicly practice their faith: Americans, and particularly young Americans, are less likely to attend services or identify with a religious group than they have at any time in recent memory. If most people haven’t just logicked their way out of believing in God, what’s behind this shift in public religious practice, and what does the shift look like in detail? That’s a big question, one less in search of a straightforward answer than a series of data points and arguments constellated over time. Here’s one: Pew has a If most people haven’t just logicked their way out of believing in God, what’s behind this shift in public religious practice, and what does the shift look like in detail? That’s a big question, one less in search of a straightforward answer than a series of data points and arguments constellated over time. Here’s one: Pew has a new survey out about the way people choose their congregations and attend services. While Americans on the whole are still going to church and other worship services less than they used to, many people are actually going more—and those who are skipping out aren’t necessarily doing it for reasons of belief. There were at least three fascinating tidbits tucked into the results of the survey. First, people who report going to worship services less frequently now than they used to overwhelmingly say the logistics of getting there are the biggest obstacle.Second, a significant number of people who said they’re not part of any particular religion expressed mistrust of religious institutions, suggesting these organizations’ reputations have something to do with why people are dropping out of public religious participation. Finally, and perhaps most interestingly, the country seems to be split in half in terms of how often people get to services. Roughly 51 percent of Americans say they go to church or another worship service somewhere between once a month and multiple times per week, while 49 percent said they go rarely or never. But within that 51 percent, more than half of people said they go more often than they used to—in other words, about quarter of Americans have gotten more active in their religious communities in recent years, not less. On the other hand, fewer than half of the people who rarely or never go to church said this has been a new decline in the last few years; a greater portion of that group said they’ve always stayed home on Sundays. All of this is a way of saying that, comparatively speaking, there’s more activity happening on the devout side of the spectrum than the drop-out side; this study suggests that even in a time of religion’s public decline, some people are experiencing religious revival. According to the survey, about one-fifth of Americans now go to religious services a few times a year, but say they used to go a lot more. Roughly half of this group stopped going as often because of what the researchers called \"practical issues\": They are too busy, have a crazy work schedule, or describe themselves as \"too lazy\" to go. Others said they just don’t care about attending services as much as doing other things. While it’s easy to empathize with the hassle of trying to wake up and rally kids to go sit still for several hours every Sunday morning, this explanation is interesting for a slightly different reason: It suggests that many people view religious services as optional in a way they might not have in the past. Fifty or 60 years ago, churches, in particular, were a While it’s easy to empathize with the hassle of trying to wake up and rally kids to go sit still for several hours every Sunday morning, this explanation is interesting for a slightly different reason: It suggests that many people view religious services as optional in a way they might not have in the past. Fifty or 60 years ago, churches, in particular, were a center of social and cultural life in America. For many people, that’s still the case, but the survey suggests that many people may be creating their social lives outside of a religious context—or perhaps forgoing that kind of social connection altogether. The experience of those who are losing their religion shouldn’t obscure those who are finding it. The sidelining of services may connect to another factor indicated in the survey: Among people who were raised religiously and who fell away from religion in adult life, roughly one-fifth said their dislike of organized religion was the reason. Another 50 percent said they stopped believing in the particular tenets of the faith they were raised in. Insofar as the decline in U.S. religious affiliation is an intellectual or philosophical story, it seems to be this: Fewer people are willing to sign on with the rules and reputations of institutions that promote faith. That doesn’t mean people don’t care about religious ideas or questions—many of those who are unaffiliated with a particular group still consider themselves \"religious\" or \"seeking\"—but they might not be as sold on the religious institutions themselves. The experience of those who are losing their religion shouldn’t obscure the experience of those who are finding it, though. Twenty-seven percent of people in the survey say they’re attending services more often than they did in the past, cutting against the country’s overall decline in religious practice. This was most common among evangelical Protestants, three-quarters of whom say they go to church at least once or twice a month. Half of the people who said they’re going to services more often explained the change in terms of their beliefs: They’ve become more religious; they found that they need God in their life; they’ve gotten more mature as they’ve aged. By contrast, relatively few said they started going to church more often for practical reasons. Belief brings people to worship, it seems, while logistics keep people way. The survey offers evidence that at least some Americans find worship services less relevant than other things they could be doing with their time, or perhaps they’re too hard to make time for. But the biggest takeaway is the variety of religious experience in America. Just as some people are drifting away from religion, others are moving toward it—and no matter what they might do on Sunday mornings, many people seem to find religious thinking still relevant to their lives.

Here\\'s why: 1. Sugar is harder to resist than any other food. We need sugar to function—without it, we\\'d quickly power down. It\\'s so important, in fact, that our bodies have the ability to synthesize it from fat, complex carbs and protein through processes that take place in the liver. But when presented with effort-free sugar on a platter (or in a drinking glass or a candy box), our bodies go wild. Sugar is even more compelling than fat, found a recent study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Researchers tracked brain activity in more than 100 high school students while they drank chocolate-flavored milkshakes and found that shakes that were high in sugar but low in fat fired up the brain\\'s reward circuitry just as strongly as super-decadent shakes that paired sugar and fat in large quantities. Increasing the fat content of the shakes didn\\'t have the same effect, affirming that sugar was what the students\\' brains really wanted. 2. ...In fact, sugar can be as hard to resist as drugs. The idea of a \"sugar addiction\" isn\\'t just a concept broadcast far and wide by your green-juice-obsessed neighbor. Experiments with both people and animals have shown that sugar affects the brain in the same way that morphine and other opioids do, and when sugar-addicted rodents were suddenly taken off the stuff, they went through withdrawal—complete with the shakes and anxiety. They had become chemically dependent, explains Nicole Avena, PhD, a neuroscientist with the New York Obesity Research Center at Columbia University who was involved in these studies and is the author of Why Diets Fail (Because You\\'re Addicted to Sugar). Humans get hooked, too. The more sugar we eat, the more we want, Avena says, and we need increasing amounts of it to keep producing the same euphoric effects. That\\'s one of the main reasons people who say they\\'re just going to have a tiny scoop of ice cream (and really mean it) end up eating four scoops. 3. It makes you gain the worst kind of fat. Consuming refined sugar won\\'t only lead to a gain in body fat, but it can also cause you to develop fat inside your liver, and that\\'s a major health risk, explains Robert H. Lustig, MD, MSL, an obesity expert and the author of Fat Chance: Beating the Odds Against Sugar, Processed Food, Obesity and Disease and The Fat Chance Cookbook. When you eat more fructose (the sweet molecule in sugar) than your liver can handle, the liver turns the excess into fat. Some of it gets transported out and lodges in the arterial walls, increasing your risk of heart disease, while the rest accumulates inside liver cells, leading to non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease, making your liver sick. Lustig says this causes insulin levels to rise, which drives up blood pressure and increases your risk for pancreatic burnout and diabetes, lipid problems and cancer. 4. It makes you old beyond your years. Consuming a lot of fructose, such as in the much-maligned (but still much-consumed) high-fructose corn syrup, accelerates cellular damage and aging, Lustig says, and causes cells all over the body to die off faster than normal. A fatty liver plus a high percentage of these rapidly decaying cells puts you at a higher risk for cancer, cognitive decline and other degenerative diseases, he says. 5. It\\'s everywhere. Eighty percent of all packaged foods contain sugar, Avena says, even many items that don\\'t seem particularly sweet. Bread, pepperoni and other cured meats, ketchup, tomato sauce in jars, peanut butter (even many \"all-natural\" brands), savory crackers—these are just a few of the unexpected foods that Avena says contain surprise amounts of non-naturally-occurring sugar, making it hard for us to stay below the American Heart Association\\'s recommendation of six teaspoons per day. 6. ...And it\\'s often hiding out under an alias. If you\\'re sold on the idea of avoiding sugar, then you know you\\'ll have to watch out for high-fructose corn syrup, too. And cane syrup. And molasses. Agave. Caramel. Dextrose, glucose solids, d-mannose...Avena says there are more than 50 names for sugar, and many of them are cryptic and easy to overlook. Scour labels to make sure that you recognize all the ingredients (for example, a bag of potato chips should contain potatoes, oil, salt, and that\\'s it). As a reminder, always consult your doctor for medical advice and treatment before starting any program. Give Up Sugar: The One \\'Crazy\\' Thing All Nutritionists Agree Is a Good Idea',\n",

Prince George, who is kicking off his sixth week of preschool at Westacre Montessori in Norfolk, near his family\\'s country home, leaves his title at the classroom door when he hangs up his coat each day. The 2-year-old royal is known simply as \"George\" among his classmates and teachers, a royal source confirms. The name will likely be written on his coat-and-backpack peg, and his teachers will write it for him on his artwork, says Louise Livingston, who is director of training at the Maria Montessori Institute, where many of the teachers at George\\'s school have studied. On Sunday Princess Kate – who has been continuing her advocacy for children\\'s mental health support – revealed her son\\'s possible career goals, sharing that he would like to follow his airman dad Prince William and join the air cadets one day. \"I am sure the Montessori teacher will have some pictures of airplanes to show him so she can teach him the names of different types of airplanes,\" says Livingston. \"It is always helpful to bond with children through their own interests,\" Livingston adds. George is adjusting \"very well\" to nursery school, which he attends part-time, PEOPLE was told last week. \"The process of settling in is important in all nursery schools, but in a Montessori environment it is particularly so because children need to be helped to adjust to the freedom of choice that will be offered to them,\" says Livingston. In the first few weeks, George\\'s teachers will have spent a great deal of time going over the rules that govern Montessori learning. \"They rest on the principles of respect for each other and respect for the things in the environment,\" says Livingston. The children pick up those tenets through play activities \"that help them to learn things like how to say \\'good morning,\\' how to push their chair back under the table so no one else trips over it, how to unroll a mat for their activity, where to place it so you are not in the way of anyone else\\'s activity and how to ask for help when you need it,\" she adds.

Not only did it haul in $966 million worldwide, it was also a master class in realistic computer animation, showing that no animal or landscape was too naturalistic or too complex to project on the green screen. Look what it hath wrought: All hail The Lion King! All hail Jon Favreau! The Walt Disney Studios on Tuesday announced that the Jungle Book studio and director are re-teaming for a \"live-action\" The Lion King \"on the fast track to production.\" \"Live action\" are in quotes there because unlike Jungle Book, which was filmed entirely in a downtown Los Angeles warehouse but at least had a real-life kid playing Mowgli, The Lion King has no human characters. There\\'s a very good chance that every frame will be created on a computer. With only servers as sets, is The Lion King (still no release date, but expect it sometime around 2020, complete with songs from the original, per Disney) to be judged as an animated or a live-action movie when it comes to awards time? And awards could certainly be in the offing. Favreau (Elf, Iron Man) has shown a certain touch for family fare, and seems to be getting more deft with each outing. The Lion King just couldn\\'t be in better hands with Favreau, who is now solidly a Disney guy. (But will they ever let him make the Magic Kingdom movie he\\'s been tinkering with now for years? Probably). Speaking of Disney, the Mouse House sure is burning through its classics: We\\'ve now had \"live action\" versions of Maleficent, Cinderella and The Jungle Book, with Beauty and the Beast on the way and others in development. The 1994 Lion King was itself a juggernaut at the box office — twice — making $968.8 million worldwide and killing it again with a 3D re-release in 2011.

              "  'context': 'The Hubble Space Telescope has captured what scientists are describing as a \"cosmic caterpillar\" nearly 6 trillion miles long slinking through deep space. The celestial critter in the new Hubble telescope photo is actually a cloud of gas stretching one light-year (10 trillion kilometers) across, scientists say. This cloud is in the process of collapsing down under its own gravity to give birth to a star — but it\\'s a race against time, because the established bright stars in its vicinity are fighting this process. There are 65 extremely hot, bright stars lurking nearby the cloud, visible on the right side of the image. A powerful stellar wind is blowing out from these stars, as well as 500 less bright companions nearby, gradually eroding the caterpillar cloud. The cloud is fighting back, too, though, bulking up over time by collecting material surrounding its outer envelope. Whether the caterpillar will gather enough mass to counteract the erosion is unclear. \"Only time will tell if the formed star will be a \\'heavy-weight\\' or a \\'light-weight\\' with respect to its mass,\" NASA scientists wrote in a statement. The caterpillar cloud is called IRAS 20324+4057, and the cluster of bright stars on the right is known as the Cygnus OB2 association. The area lies 4,500 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus, the Swan. The bright stars are 15 light-years away from the cloud. The new image is a composite of two photographs. One was captured in green and infrared light by the Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys in 2006. The other comes from the ground-based Isaac Newton Telescope, which took the data in 2003 under a project called the INT Photometric H-alpha Survey. The composite image was released Aug. 29 by the Hubble Space Telescope team.

              "  'context': 'Primetime football games are often some of the most watched programs on television, but that wasn’t the case for Monday night’s NFC South matchup. The high-scoring affair between the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints drew what’s likely to be a record-low in \"Monday Night Football\" history. According to Sports Media Watch, the game earned just a 5.7 overnight rating on ESPN. The previous low was a 6.7, which happened on two separate occasions, once in 2007. The reason behind the low viewership isn’t that Drew Brees and Matt Ryan are boring, or that fans didn’t feel like watching the Saints’ secondary get ripped to shreds yet again. It has to do with the other battle going on at the same time between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Monday night’s presidential debate, the first of three, drew a whopping 80.9 million viewers in America across the 12 networks that carried it, according to CNN. That doesn’t include those who watched at restaurants or bars, or the people who streamed it live online. The debate earned a 46.2 overnight rating, which is unprecedented for a broadcast outside of the Super Bowl. By comparison, this year’s Super Bowl averaged a household rating of 49.0. 46.2 overnight for the debate just -6% lower than this year\\'s Super Bowl overnight. — Michael Mulvihill (@mulvihill79) September 27, 2016 In 2015, the Patriots’ victory over the Seahawks drew a 47.5 rating, while Super Bowl 48 earned a 46.4. That just goes to show how many Americans stopped what they were doing to watch Trump and Clinton debate our country’s issues for the first time. The top market for the debate on Monday night was New York, which earned a 55.1. The last time the Giants were in the Super Bowl, New York averaged a 49.7 rating, to give that some context. That 55.1 rating in NYC is really remarkable. The last time the Giants won the Super Bowl NYC did a 49.7. Game 7 of the 2001 WS did a 39.5. — Michael Mulvihill (@mulvihill79) September 27, 2016 This was obviously just a matter of poor timing for the NFL, with the debate falling on the same night as a less-than-exciting game. This isn’t the first time it’s happened, though. The last time a presidential debate competed with a Monday night game was in 2012, when the Lions-Bears drew a 7.3 overnight rating.

That\\'s why HuffPost Celebrity decided to launch its all-new #nofilter quick-fire question-and-answer series. Because how well do you know someone until they\\'ve shared their guiltiest pleasures? Bill Engvall is one of the best damn \\'blue collar\\' comedians you\\'ll find in these parts. The \"Dancing With the Stars\" alum was on his way to becoming a household name soon after teaming up with Blue Collar Comedy pals Larry the Cable Guy, Ron White and Jeff Foxworthy -- circa 2000 -- where they took their act on the road, quickly becoming the hippest rednecks in North America. Engvall\\'s album \"Here\\'s Your Sign\" is certified platinum and his second album \"Dorkfish,\" landed at the No. 1 position on the Billboard Comedy Chart. The 56-year-old comedian even got his own TV show \"The Bill Engvall Show\" (2007--2009) on TBS where he hired a then unknown, future Academy Award-winning actress, Jennifer Lawrence, who played his teenage daughter, Lauren Pearson. Engvall braved the balmy warm weather out west while agreeing to sit down and take HuffPost\\'s #nofilter challenge. While we had his attention (prior to the quiz), we asked about his courageous stint on Season 17 of \"Dancing With The Stars\" -- with dancing pro Emma Slater (he finished fourth) -- and his time on set with that little superstar, JLaw. I loved you on \"Dancing with the Stars.\" How much fun was that for you? It was a blast. As I told Emma, my little dance partner, \"I didn\\'t want to like it as much as I did.\" It was the hardest thing I\\'ve ever done in my life, but I will tell you that it\\'s the most addictive thing and I actually miss it believe it or not -- even through all the aches and pains and pulled groins. It was something that was so far out of my comfort zone. It taught me that when life puts a challenge in front of you, don\\'t necessarily back away from it because it may be something that you didn\\'t see. How much pressure did you feel each week on the results show? I noticed each week when you were saved, there was this shocked look on your face. I would say that after about week five every time Emma and I got pushed forward my reaction was, \"Hey. Oh God. Really? Can we not recount?\" (Laughs) Honestly, after week two I didn\\'t feel any pressure at all because I had already achieved what I thought I could do. Did you ever hold out hope that you could win that Mirror Ball Trophy? I honestly think I had a shot to win it. I\\'m glad Amber Riley won. It actually played out the way it should have because getting knocked out the first night of the finals was perfect because I was actually done. Literally my body was saying there\\'s just no more in the tank. Because it was 13 weeks of six hours-a-day without a day off. In one of the taped packages, I laughed out loud when they ran the piece where Emma had her legs wrapped around your neck. The look on your face was priceless. The thing was she kept wanting to do all these tricks and I was like, \"I don\\'t know if I can do them.\" So we did this one and when they showed the footage, my friend\\'s like \"Dude, what\\'s your wife think?\" I go \"Please! Emma is younger than my daughter.\" (Laughs) It was like she had a lot more energy and flexibility than I did. My only thought was just don\\'t drop her. Don\\'t do anything to hurt her. So that\\'s why the look on my face was like, \"Oh, let\\'s just get through this.\" The last time I interviewed you, you were in the middle of \"The Bill Engvall Show.\" You told me at the time: \"If it gets canceled, I will be devastated.\" Shows get canceled every day so when your show was axed, how did you take it? It hurt because I felt like if this show had been on five years earlier, I\\'d be in syndication. The week that it got canceled I had talked to TBS and they had said we\\'re going to announce that we\\'re going to shoot 75 more and be in syndication. Literally the next day, the market went crazy and the bottom dropped out. In syndication, the biggest buyers are car dealerships. When they got hit, there was nobody buying syndication, so I literally was one day from being in syndication. Jennifer Lawrence played your teenage daughter. Yeah, bless her little heart. All the interviews she did, she always gave me credit. In fact, when she was on the Barbara Walters special just recently somebody called me and said, \"Hey, Jennifer Lawrence said you gave her her first job.\" And I said, \"Well we did.\" She was one of those I knew we weren\\'t going to be able to hold her very long. We were going to have to write the episode where she went off to college because you just knew she was going to move on to bigger things. Did you teach her everything she needed to know about acting? (Laughs) No. That girl had it. And I hate that word, she had \"it,\" but she really did. When she won the Academy Award last year, how proud were you for her? I couldn\\'t have been more proud if she had been my own daughter. The thing I loved about Jenny and I still love is that she\\'s just down to earth. I hope the business doesn\\'t jade her because she\\'s so genuine and I think that\\'s what people love about her. What\\'s your guiltiest pleasure? Getting massages. If you had only one choice, would you rather be the sexiest man in the world or the smartest? I think I\\'d rather be the sexiest. I\\'ve learned in my older age that sexy gets you further than brains. When was the last time you told a little white lie? It was on \"Dancing with the Stars.\" After I pulled my groin, the producer asked me if I was going to be able to go on and I didn\\'t think I was, but I said, \"You betcha.\" What\\'s the one thing you do when you\\'re alone that you wouldn\\'t do in front of anyone else? Sing at the top of my lungs. When I\\'m in the car and a song comes on I like, I\\'m that guy. What happens in your recurring dream? I dream that I\\'m best buddies with the Clintons and Al Pacino is my best friend. Is it okay to recline your seat in an airplane? It depends on the airline. Southwest Airlines, no. But Delta, yes. Finish this sentence: I\\'m funnier than ... (Long pause) ... a root canal. What TV show from the old days do you miss the most? \"The Andy Griffith Show.\" What\\'s funny about that show is if you tried to sell that show today, they would look at you like you\\'re an idiot. Exactly. What I like about it is there were no sexual innuendos. No ... not even between Andy and Miss Crump. Finish this sentence: I start to feel old when I ... ... get out of bed in the morning. What movie could you watch 10 times? \"Shawshank Redemption.\" What\\'s your biggest pet peeve when you\\'re driving? When I let people in and they don\\'t wave. What is the most overused word in the English language? Selfie. I hate that word. What would you not do for a million dollars?

The quarterback made the 49ers final roster that was announced on Saturday. The team cut a total of 20 players so that they could get down to the NFL mandated 53-man limit by 4 p.m. ET. The 49ers had four quarterbacks on their roster going into Saturday, and it was pretty clear that at least one of them was going to cut. In the end, coach Chip Kelly decided to dump rookie Jeff Driskel and keep Kaepernick. The move by Kelly wasn\\'t a complete surprise. The 49ers coach has said all along that if he kept Kaepernick, it would be a football decision that would be unrelated to his protest of the national anthem. In the week leading up to cut day, Kelly made it clear that he thought Kaepernick was one of the two best quarterbacks on his roster. The decision to keep Kaepernick raises some interesting questions going forward. For one, Kaepernick\\'s contract now becomes an issue. If the quarterback plays at all in 2016 and gets injured, then his 2017 base salary of $14.5 million would automatically become guaranteed. Kaepernick also receives a $125,000 bonus for every game that he\\'s on the team\\'s active roster, so if the 49ers decide to deactivate him on game day -- and go with Christian Ponder as their No. 2 QB -- then the team could save $2 million in bonus money ($125,000 x 16 games). Of course, Kelly doesn\\'t think like a front office guy when it comes to contracts, so don\\'t expect him to deactivate Kaepernick just to keep him from earning a game day bonus. #49ers Chip Kelly: Right now Blaine is No. 1 and will start vs. the Rams. Kap is No. 2. Only ones to be active on game day. — Cam Inman (@CamInman) September 3, 2016 As Kelly said on Saturday, Kaepernick will be the team\\'s No. 2 quarterback behind Blaine Gabbert for the team\\'s season opener on Sept. 12 against the Rams. Anyway, besides the contract, keeping Kaepernick also means that the 49ers are also going to have deal with the controversy that comes with him. Kaepernick\\'s decision to protest the national anthem has become a scorching hot topic in America. \"There\\'s a lot of things that need to change,\" Kaepernick said on Aug. 28. \"One specifically? Police brutality. There\\'s people being murdered unjustly and not being held accountable. People are being given paid leave for killing people. That\\'s not right. That\\'s not right by anyone\\'s standards.\" The 49ers quarterback has said that one of the big reasons he\\'s protesting the national anthem is because he has an issue with the police brutality that\\'s going on unchecked in this country. That statement didn\\'t sit well with the Santa Clara Police Officer\\'s Association, and that group has now threatened to pull officers from working 49ers games at Levi\\'s Stadium. Of course, even though Kaepernick\\'s on the team now, the 49ers could change their mind at any point and cut him sometime down the road.

Fiona Stanley, The Good Pub Guide editor, said: ‘Piped music, canned music, muzak, lift music, airport music - call it what you will, it’s there and our readers loathe it in any shape or form. ‘It enlists bitter complaints from our readers and has done so ever since we started the guide 35 years ago. ‘It’s such an issue that we have always asked every Main Entry pub since 1983 whether or not they have it, and then clearly state this in each review.’ One pub-goer who contributed to the guide, advised: ‘At best it’s bad manners foisting a random choice of music on you that you have not chosen and do not want to hear, at worst, it interferes with people’s hearing.’ View photos Another said: ‘People go to pubs to meet their friends, be sociable, have a drink or a meal and discuss the problems of the world.’ But not all publicans are willing to listen to their patrons, with a significant amount believing that music actually plays a positive part in their business. ‘In the end it comes down to the question we’ve been asking for years’, Mrs Stanley said. ‘Do good pubs need piped music and do the majority of good pubs’ customers want it? ‘And hand on heart, of all the thousands of pubs we have visited over the many years of producing The Good Pub Guide, it’s pretty rare for us to feel our pub experience has been heightened by what is being played through the speakers above our heads. View photos ‘It’s clear our readers agree so surely it’s time for all publicans to take note and turn it off.’ But it’s not all bad news in the pub world, as the national survey also found that the average price of a pint had increased by just 1p to £3.47, compared with last year’s 15p rise. The guide also awarded the coveted pub of the year title to the 300-year-old Horse Guards in Tillington, West Sussex, which boasts ‘beams, panelling and open fires in rambling rooms, inventive food, local ales and a charming garden’.

              "  'context': 'One of the many reasons Arnab Goswami’s response to the criticism of his interview with Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unprecedented is that for the first time, Arnab felt the need to issue a personal reply. Usually, Times Now exists in its own little world. In the Times Now universe, other news organisations revolve around Times Now. Their only reason for existence is to supplement the reporting done by Times Now. To them, only Times Now breaks all the stories that matter. They’d like you to believe that Times Now is the only news organisation asking the right questions. They pretend that it’s the only channel that doesn’t have an agenda. All the information required by a viewer of Times Now can be had from the channel itself. No need to watch or read anything else. Times Now functions less like a news organisation and more like a cult dedicated to Arnab Goswami, the Dear Leader of Indian news. That is why his army of reporters were out in full force on social media defending their one true god against any and all criticism. Remember, the chosen one can never do anything wrong. The only reason he is being mocked is because the others are jealous of him. They will never have his voice or his brains or his success. The only reason they go after him is to bring him down. Arnab and other members of his cult tried to dismiss the backlash as pushback from Lutyens’ loyalists but even they know that is not the truth. People did not criticise him because they wanted him to be disrespectful to the prime minister. No sane person would want or expect him to yell at an elected representative of the public. You can be respectful and still ask less brown-nosing questions like: Are you being held back from being completely and totally awesome? Arnab the character However, the fact that the self-proclaimed voice of a billion people felt the need to climb down from his heavenly abode to chatter with us mere mortals means that the universal panning his interview received did really disturb him. Like every other megalomaniac who pretends to never be bothered by external brickbats, he too is quite sensitive to them. The character Arnab plays on the Times Now Newshour – and it is a character – is based on the myth that he speaks truth to power. That’s his whole shtick! It doesn’t matter to him who the recipient of his rant is! It doesn’t matter to him how uncomfortable his show makes the people in power. It doesn’t matter if he upsets the delicate sensibilities of the populace. The truth shall prevail, Monday to Friday, at 9 pm, only on your channel. Yet, the minute the voice of the nation came face-to-face with actual, unadulterated power, it turned subservient. The voice went from being tough and assertive to timid and submissive. The man who isn’t afraid to call a spade an anti-national couldn’t even sustain short periods of eye contact with power. Power will always look for the easy way out. Power doesn’t want to be questioned; power wants to be obeyed. Power doesn’t look at those bowing down to it as someone they need to favour. Power only wants to use them to serve its own end. Once power has no use for you, it will discard you and forget that you ever existed. In the story of the Wizard of Oz, when the curtain falls, the grand wizard who claims to be capable of great, magical feats is revealed to be an ordinary man who is in over his head. Yes, Arnab will still command the \"best ratings\" out of all the other news channels. He will still have an inordinately loud voice in determining our national discourse. He will still be the Jupiter to the other news channels’ Pluto. In a few days, people will move on and forget this incident along with this silly article. But, at 9 pm on June 27, the curtain was lifted, and it was revealed that a man who claimed to be capable of great, magical feats was just another ordinary man who is in over his head.

Of course the answer depends on how you define dangerous. Personally I’ve had a thing about sharks since the first time I saw Jaws. But if you’re judging by how many people are killed by an animal every year, then the answer isn’t any of the above. It’s mosquitoes. When it comes to killing humans, no other animal even comes close. Take a look: What makes mosquitoes so dangerous? Despite their innocuous-sounding name—Spanish for \"little fly\"—they carry devastating diseases. The worst is malaria, which kills more than 600,000 people every year; another 200 million cases incapacitate people for days at a time. It threatens half of the world’s population and causes billions of dollars in lost productivity annually. Other mosquito-borne diseases include dengue fever, yellow fever, and encephalitis. There are more than 2,500 species of mosquito, and mosquitoes are found in every region of the world except Antarctica. During the peak breeding seasons, they outnumber every other animal on Earth, except termites and ants. They were responsible for tens of thousands of deaths during the construction of the Panama Canal. And they affect population patterns on a grand scale: In many malarial zones, the disease drives people inland and away from the coast, where the climate is more welcoming to mosquitoes. Considering their impact, you might expect mosquitoes to get more attention than they do. Sharks kill fewer than a dozen people every year and in the U.S. they get a week dedicated to them on TV every year. Mosquitoes kill 50,000 times as many people, but if there’s a TV channel that features Mosquito Week, I haven’t heard about it. That’s why we’re having Mosquito Week on the Gates Notes. Everything I’m posting this week is dedicated to this deadly creature. You can learn about my recent trip to Indonesia to see an ingenious way to combat dengue fever by inoculating not people, but mosquitoes. (Somehow this story involved me offering up my bare arm to a cage full of hungry mosquitoes so they could feed on my blood.) You can read a harrowing account of what it’s like to have malaria and hear from an inspiring Tanzanian scientist who’s fighting it. And I’ve shared a few thoughts from Melinda’s and my recent trip to Cambodia, where I saw some fascinating work that could point the way to eradicating malaria, which would be one of the greatest accomplishments in health ever. I hope you’ll have a look around. I can’t promise that Anopheles gambiae will be quite as exciting as hammerheads and Great Whites.

              "  'context': 'James Madison University is continuing to face pressure over how it disciplines students for sexual assault, with a growing number of alumni and students demanding reforms. JMU is just the latest school in Virginia to face federal and public scrutiny over its handling of sexual violence, and alumni are noting they raised nearly identical concerns 20 years ago. But state lawmakers have remained largely silent, even as three public institutions are under federal investigation. Four universities in Virginia are currently being investigated by the U.S. Department of Education\\'s Office for Civil Rights for possible Title IX violations specifically related to sexual violence -- JMU, the University of Virginia, the College of William & Mary and the University of Richmond. Two other schools in the state, the Virginia Military Institute and Virginia Commonwealth University, faced Title IX reviews that concluded this spring. JMU\\'s case is based on a complaint from a student who has since withdrawn from the university. The school found three men guilty of sexual assaulting her, and guilty of harassment for spreading video of the incident around campus. The school punished them with \"expulsion after graduation.\" \"A finding of responsible, but with expulsion after graduation, is not a just decision in this case,\" Tammy Castle, an associate professor of justice studies at JMU, told The Huffington Post. \"Students have been suspended for drinking offenses, and expelled for plagiarism, and this sends the message to the university community that sexual assault is not as serious as these other behaviors,\" Castle added. \"It also discourages victims from speaking out against sexual assault, and supports a rape culture.\" Students And Alumni Demand Change The case, first publicized in June, has outraged students and alumni. An online petition demanding a change in JMU\\'s sexual assault policies had reached 12,000 signatures as of Tuesday. JMU spokesman Bill Wyatt noted that prior to the petition, the university put in place \"a comprehensive, ongoing review of our policies, procedures, training, and support services relating to sexual harassment and assault.\" He declined to comment further to HuffPost except to refer back to a June 19 statement. However, alumni are noting in online discussions that this controversy is similar to issues some of them protested about 20 years ago. In 1993, students could only be charged with \"sexual misconduct,\" which covered everything from unwanted touching to rape. Students demanded a new policy that differentiated between more and less serious offenses, and at one point organized an overnight takeover of an administrative building on campus. \"We\\'re talking right now about how we can respond to this latest situation,\" said Brian Kildee, one of the activists who pushed for reforms to the school\\'s policy in the early \\'90s. \"We succeeded in changing some key policies in the 1990s. Twenty years later, it\\'s clear that changing the underlying culture is much more difficult.\" Brad Perry, who about 14 years ago served two years as the Male Outreach Coordinator in the now-defunct JMU Office of Sexual Assault Education, said that during his tenure, officials were frequently unwilling to investigate cases. \"I remember a campus sexual assault colleague of mine said, \\'Schools will never change the way they handle these cases until they are more scared of being sued by a victim\\'s family than a perpetrator\\'s family,\\'\" recalled Perry, who later spent a decade as a Statewide Violence Prevention Coordinator at a Virginia nonprofit. \"[Universities] don\\'t really have a whole lot of incentive to do much about this and they haven\\'t.\" Investigations On Multiple Campuses Each of the investigations at the Virginia schools, like that at JMU, was sparked by federal complaints. UVA\\'s investigation is unusual in that it started in 2011, but remains open. The Education Department declined to say why the investigation was so long-running, and noted \"that some cases take longer than others due to the nature and complexity of the issues involved.\" Officials for the University of Richmond and the College of William & Mary confirmed their investigations were due to complaints. Richmond vowed to cooperate and noted it has in place a bystander-awareness training program to help students recognize and prevent sexual violence. William & Mary referred to a previous statement making similar points. VCU wrapped up a Title IX investigation in April with a signed agreement about a new policy it must put in place to deal with sexual violence and harassment. The April 29 letter closing the investigation -- which had been sparked by two complaints -- stated it did not determine whether VCU was compliant or not with Title IX, but the letter concluded OCR\\'s review. OCR consolidated the two complaints about VCU into one investigation. One complaint was from a graduate student who alleged the university didn\\'t properly handle discrimination she faced in a class, took nine months to resolve her case, and retaliated against her when she voiced her concerns. The other complaint alleged VCU botched a Title IX investigation and failed to coordinate with law enforcement to maintain victim confidentiality. There was no letter of findings issued to say what, if anything, VCU had done wrong in its handling of the cases. A recent OCR investigation found that the Virginia Military Institute, the oldest state-supported military college in the country, required female students who are pregnant or parenting to resign or face expulsion. One senior male cadet issued wire hangers to female student and told them they were their \"abortion tools,\" but VMI failed to involve a Title IX coordinator or take steps to discipline the male cadet. VMI agreed earlier this year to take a number of steps dictated by OCR to rectify its sex discrimination. No Legislative Action Despite a flurry of activity by federal officials at Virginia\\'s colleges, the state\\'s lawmakers have remained on the sidelines. The Virginia governor\\'s office, the leadership of the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates, and the chairs of the state education committees in the Virginia legislature all failed to respond to requests for comment from The Huffington Post about whether lawmakers had plans to address sexual assault on campus in the state. The Virginia legislature did consider one piece of legislation in 2011 that would have brought school and police investigations closer together by requiring local law enforcement to be notified of all campus rapes. The law was named \"Kathryn\\'s Law\" after a UVA student, Kathryn Russell, who went public about how in 2004 the university tried to dissuade her from reporting her rape. UVA was also sued in 2003 by a rape victim who was told she\\'d face punishment if she spoke about her assailant, who the university had determined was responsible for sexual assault but had allowed to stay on campus. Following a 2004 story on the case in a local newspaper, more than 400 students gathered on campus wearing symbolic pink or red gags. The Education Department determined in 2008 that UVA violated the campus security law the Clery Act by requiring accusers to agree to a nondisclosure policy as a precondition to accessing outcomes and sanction information. Yet back in Virginia\\'s state legislature, Kathryn\\'s Law died in committee and never got a full vote. The bill did result in the Virginia Crime Commission conducting a statewide survey of college campuses. The review found that in 2010, there had been a total of 16 rape reports on Virginia campuses but zero arrests. Forcible fondling had led to three arrests. The commission found 10 percent of Virginia colleges did not have a written policy for rape investigations, as required by Va. Code § 9.1-1301, and 39 percent of universities were using a standard of proof in campus rape adjudications higher than what the federal government recommends. In addition, 76 percent allowed an accused rapist to cross-examine his reported victim. The ongoing federal investigations of JMU, UVA, William & Mary and Richmond could take six months to several years to complete. OCR typically concludes these investigations with resolution agreements stipulating changes that must be made by the schools. If the office is unable to reach a resolution agreement with the school, it can refer the case to the U.S. Department of Justice or move to cut off the university from federal funding. Need help?

Of course, he never thought the sale would actually go through, but to his huge surprise it did. That’s right, in a couple of clicks, and for the princely sum of $12, Sanmay had become the proud owner of the most famous website address in the world. However, it didn’t take Google long (one minute, to be precise) to realize something had gone terribly wrong with its system, prompting it to fire off an email to Sanmay telling him it’d canceled his order and refunded his purchase. After reviewing the error, Google decided to give Sanmay a financial reward for bringing the bug to its attention. Despite people’s curiosity about how much Google paid the guy who momentarily owned its domain name, neither the Web giant nor Sanmay disclosed the sum. Until now, that is. Sanmay, who’s currently an MBA student at Babson College in Boston, said last year the company had offered him \"a $x reward in a very Googley way,\" and now we see what he means. Sort of. In a post on its security blog this week reviewing events from 2015, the Mountain View company revealed it paid Sanmay $6,006.13, the figure supposedly spelling out Google. \"Squint a little and you’ll see it,\" the company says. Of course, for a company that reported profits of $4 billion for its most recent quarter, some will wonder why Google didn’t dig a little deeper into its pockets for an error of this magnitude. However, the money was paid as part of Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program, which offers cash to those spotting bugs lurking within its multitude of systems and tools. The company said in the post that last year it paid out more than $2 million to over 300 bug hunters around the world – equal to about $6,000 per payout, the same as Sanmay received (if you squint a little). Anyway, the MBA student said from the start that holding the Google domain \"was never about money,\" and was perfectly happy with Google’s reward.

A bad hire can be financially costly to your company and set back your team’s progress. There’s an enormous burden on managers tasked with determining what their team needs and then making a judgment call on who can fill that role, within a relatively short period of time. Experience, intelligence, and determination are all important aspects to consider when looking at a job candidate, but the primary focus needs to be on talent, argue Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman in their classic management guide, \"First, Break All the Rules.\" When the book was first published in 1999, Buckingham told Business Insider, it was controversial for its conclusion that the best managers develop their employees’ strengths and ignore their weaknesses, since the prevailing wisdom was that bosses should amass a team of well-rounded individuals always correcting their shortcomings. The coauthors’ conclusions weren’t based on intuition, but rather 25 years of Gallup studies of 80,000 managers across 400 companies. Over time, more companies began adopting Buckingham and Coffman’s prescribed approach, and now companies like Facebook operate entirely on their philosophy. Facebook HR chief Lori Goler recommends their book to all new managers. In their book, Buckingham and Coffman define talent as \"a recurring pattern of thought, feeling, or behavior that can be productively applied.\" They say there are three types of talent to consider: Striving talents: \"They explain why he gets out of bed every day, why he is motivated to push and push just that little bit harder.\" \"They explain he gets out of bed every day, he is motivated to push and push just that little bit harder.\" Thinking talents: \"They explain how he thinks, how he weighs up alternatives, how he comes to his decisions.\" \"They explain he thinks, he weighs up alternatives, he comes to his decisions.\" Relating talents: \"They explain whom he trusts, whom he builds relationships with, whom he confronts, and whom he ignores.\" It is up to the manager to determine a talents profile for the position they are looking to fill. It’s important, Buckingham told us, that this profile doesn’t become a checklist that guides the job interview. The worst thing a manager can do in an interview, he said, is ask too many follow-up questions in an attempt to find the answer they’re looking for. \"Every time you ask a question you give something away,\" he said. \"You don’t want to give anything away.\" Buckingham explained that the interviewer should be looking for frequent behaviors, and if the candidate is a great fit, they will naturally reveal these behaviors without prodding.

And this isn\\'t just any song, Keys won a GRAMMY for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance for \"If I Ain\\'t Got You.\" When the song was over, Keys marched up to the stage, hugged Diaz and said, \"wow.\" The audience had learned before the performance that Diaz grew up idolizing Keys, but the other coaches still put up a decent fight to get her to join their teams. After pitches from Miley Cyrus, a poem from Adam Levine, and a great talk from Blake Shelton, Keys was back. And what did she do? Keys sang the song back to her. After she said, \"can you just tell me a little bit about yourself?\" Yes, that\\'s right, Keys, 15-time GRAMMY winner sang the song back to her. And with that 30-second performance, Keys changed \"The Voice.\" And, maybe, I teared up. Alicia Keys Changed \"The Voice\" With This One Move During Blind Auditions',\n",

For the second consecutive year, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing plans to give away at least $3 million of his bonus to roughly 10,000 of his company's workers, Bloomberg News reports. Employees across 20 countries will take part in Yuanqing's wealth with 85 percent of payout recipients working in China. The average payout per worker of $325 is nearly equivalent to a month’s pay for an employee in China. A company spokesperson told Bloomberg that a majority of the workers who will receive part of the bonus will be hourly employees who are not eligible for other bonus programs. Yuanqing's generosity may be partly inspired by his company's record sales this year. In the second quarter, Lenovo passed Hewlett-Packard as the world’s number one supplier of personal computers. As CEO pay has exploded over the last couple of decades, the gap between how much executives make compared with their workers continues to skyrocket. For S&P 500 companies, the average ratio of CEO-to-worker pay was 204 in 2012, Bloomberg reports. That figure is up 20 percent from 2009 and 1,000 percent from 1950. Luckily, Yuanqing is not alone in sharing his company's success with every employee. Lord Wolfson, CEO of the U.K. retailer Next, gave away his entire annual bonus of $3.6 million to his employees in April.

BREAKING: Chaos breaks out in House chamber as Speaker Paul Ryan gavels in following all-day sit-in by Democrats. pic.twitter.com/gK2zhVYf4G — CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) June 23, 2016 House Democrats staged a sit-in June 22 for more than 15 hours to try and force a vote on gun control measures. Here\\'s why. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) The original post, which explains why the cameras were off in the first place, follows: It’s a politically convenient thing to imply — and House Democrats sitting on the floor of the House since 11:30 a.m. aren’t shy about implying it — that House Republicans shut off the normally unblinking eyes of the C-SPAN cameras to try to hide the Democrats’ sit-in demanding a vote on gun control. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) even accused House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) of doing it himself. Hero @repjohnlewis is leading a sit-in on gun violence & @SpeakerRyan shut off the camera so you can’t watch. Shameful. #NoBillNoBreak — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 22, 2016 But that’s actually not the whole story. In fact, the cameras are turned off as a matter of procedure when the House isn’t in session — and the Democrats are essentially forcing the House out of session with their sit-in. It also seems worth noting that, when the tables were turned eight years ago and Republicans were doing a sit-in, both the cameras and the lights were also off. So let’s put partisan politics aside and explain the real reason the C-SPAN cameras — the only cameras allowed in Congress — are off. When the new Congress got together in January of last year, like every new Congress before it, it voted on the rules that would govern it. One of those rules — ostensibly not that controversial at the time — was that when the House of Representatives wasn’t in session, the C-SPAN cameras would be off. C-SPAN is useful for capturing a lot of moments the American public might not otherwise see, but no need to broadcast an empty room, right? (Side note: As even approving rules for C-SPAN’s filming indicates, Congress controls what the cameras show and when.) Fast forward to Wednesday, when the House was just about to go out of session for the afternoon. House Democrats, led by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), seized the floor and demanded a vote on gun-control measures. They literally sat down on the carpeted floor to demand a vote and said they’d stay there as long as it took to negotiate one. D.C. perked up. We turned to C-SPAN. And C-SPAN had nothing to offer us. That’s because House Republicans presiding over the floor at the time gaveled the Congress on a break as the sit-in started. There was clearly a disruption going on, and they weren’t sure what to do. (The House isn’t like the Senate, where one lawmaker can force it to stay in session for hours and hours.) So the House went on recess, and per the rules, the C-SPAN cameras shut off. Even congressional reporters, the people who cover the mundane ins and outs of House proceedings, were confused. Not to politicize C-SPAN, but this is one of those moments where they should maybe turn on the cameras. This is an unprecedented situation. — Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) June 22, 2016 C-SPAN felt compelled to issue this statement via Twitter. It even pinned it to the top of its Twitter profile, meaning it\\'s the first tweet people see when they visit its page. A yellow alert now runs on the bottom of the screen: \"CAMERAS IN CHAMBER CONTROLLED BY HOUSE.\" C-SPAN has no control over the U.S. House TV cameras. — CSPAN (@cspan) June 22, 2016 House Democrats began broadcasting their sit-in on Periscope, a feature most definitely not available the last time a sit-in occurred, back in 2008. (Also technically against House rules — no devices allowed on the floor.) Back then, House Republicans staged a sit-in as Congress was about to go on a month-long August break. They wanted Democrats, who were then in the majority, to allow a vote to expand oil and gas drilling to help alleviate $4-a-gallon prices. During that sit-in, as Politico reported — and Ryan’s office felt compelled to point out — House Democrats actually turned off the lights in the chamber, too. \"Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the Democrats adjourned the House, turned off the lights and killed the microphones, but Republicans are still on the floor talking gas prices,\" wrote Politico’s John Bresnahan. (The only other sit-in since the 1970s that political scientist and Catholic University professor Matthew Green could recall before that, in 1995, was over a budget dispute. Sit-ins are a pretty rare phenomenon.) Back to Wednesday’s sit-in: Sure, Ryan technically could gavel back in session to get the cameras rolling again. But that’s not really within the realm of political reality; House Democrats are actively working against his interests, both politically and policy-wise. A few hours after the sit-in began, the cameras did flash on when the GOP gaveled back in and made one futile attempt to restore order. They essentially asked the Democrats to stop their sit-in and go back to the day’s business. Democrats refused, even yelling over the speaker. And the House gaveled back out. Per House rules, the C-SPAN cameras went dark again. And they’ve stayed that way for the rest of the sit-in. Lawmakers started filming the action on Periscope again. And in a weird, full-circle moment, C-SPAN started airing the Periscope feed — apparently a first for C-SPAN. C-SPAN cameras couldn’t show Democrats’ gun control sit-in — so Democrats did it themselves',\n",

Primarily because it asked the WRONG question about sex. More on that after you see the results. Per Independent: Ten is the ideal number of lovers to have had for both men and women, researchers have claimed. More than 1,000 people took part in the online survey for Britain’s biggest extra-marital dating site IllicitEncouters.com, being asked how many lovers they would want a new partner to have had. Between eight and 12 was the most popular answer, chosen by 38 per cent of women and 37 per cent of men. You see, what they have concluded is the ideal number of partners we want the person we are having sex with to have had, NOT the ideal number we want. There is a big difference there. Of course no one wants to have sex with some chick who’s fucked all 53 guys on an NFL roster, so naturally this number is going to be substantially lower than our own hopes and dreams. The study even concluded that... Any number above 20 was considered a turn-off, chosen by 3 per cent of women and 4 per cent of men. Yeah, dipshits, it is a turn-off to know that about a person, but is a guy who has slept with 100 chicks turned-off by his own actions? I highly doubt it. Unless, of course, he’s acquired an STD or a one-night-stand child. Then, and only THEN, is when he will start to regret his past transgressions.

              "  'context': 'There’s one group of Americans that consistently cares about climate change \"This is climate change. It’s going to get worse.\" By Jeremy Deaton Violeta Maya lives on the west side of Brooklyn, along a busy highway, in a neighborhood spare of trees and green spaces. Now 80, Maya emigrated from Puerto Rico when she was a child. In the intervening decades, she has watched pollution from cars and factories cloud the skies above her home. \"We have a lot of pollution, and this has caused a lot of asthma,\" Maya, who suffers from asthma herself, said. \"They bring more stuff into this community than they do into Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, anywhere else. We can’t breathe.\" \"This is climate change. It’s going to get worse.\" For Maya, the hazards extend beyond the noxious fumes seeping from tailpipes and smokestacks. Planet-warming carbon pollution is fueling record-breaking heat around the country and in New York. She can feel it. \"The heat is so bad that my doctor said to me, ‘You cannot go out in the heat,’\" she said. \"I see older people with umbrellas. I see people who have to hold onto the gate for a while to catch their breath. This is climate change. It’s going to get worse.\" Sunset Park, Brooklyn. CREDIT: Wikipedia Maya isn’t alone. Poll after poll after poll after poll after poll finds Hispanics and Latinos are more likely to acknowledge the climate is changing, worry about the threat, and support policy to slow the rise in temperature — even though they are less likely to identify as environmentalists. Why? One possibility is that Latinos tend to lean left and vote Democrat. But even among Democrats, people of color are more likely to believe climate change should be a top priority for policymakers. Among Americans of color, Hispanics and Latinos stand out: Several polls — see here, here and here — find they are more likely to support pro-climate policy than African Americans, even though they are less likely to identify as liberal or Democrat. There a few guesses as to why this is the case. Foreign-born Latinos may care more because they have strong ties to countries that are threatened by climate change. Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico are acutely vulnerable to heat, drought coastal flooding. Severe heat is worsening pollution in Mexico City, making the air almost unbreathable. Analysis from Pew suggests the lurking variable is age. \"With a median age of 27 years, Hispanics are significantly younger than whites (42), blacks (33) and the nation as a whole (37). Overall, younger Americans are more likely than older Americans to say the Earth is warming because of human activity.\" It is difficult to tease the signal from the noise. The more you slice and dice the numbers, the harder it becomes to make inferences about any particular group. In surveys of American adults, Hispanics typically make a up a small subset of the data. The key variable may not be age or country of origin, but rather who stands on the front lines of climate change and — more importantly — who doesn’t. Feeling the brunt of climate change In a recent study, Maryland residents were asked about their perceptions of climate risks. Vulnerable groups saw themselves as being more at risk to the impacts of climate change. \"Historically socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, such as Hispanics, Latinos, and African Americans, may face higher exposure to environmental risks and have less capacity to adapt,\" Karen Akerlof, George Mason University social scientist and the study’s lead author, said. Even when controlling for ideology and acceptance of climate change, Akerlof explained, \"we find that Hispanics and Latinos are significantly more likely [than whites] to think that they themselves and their households are at risk from the health effects of climate change.\" Los Angeles on a smoggy day. CREDIT: Wikipedia Hispanics are more likely to live in cities, near polluting factories, power plants and refineries. According to a report from the National Hispanic Medical Association, they are more likely to suffer from asthma or other bronchial maladies as a result. Owing to the urban heat island effect, Hispanics are also more vulnerable to heat waves— a threat compounded, oftentimes, by limited access to air conditioning or medical care. \"In many cases, we’re talking about people who are in lower income brackets and live in urban areas that are potentially prone to high heat indexes,\" said Akerlof. \"These are obviously populations of concern.\" \"These are obviously populations of concern.\" Just as relevant as the statistics regarding who feels vulnerable to climate change is who doesn’t. Akerlof pointed to a series of studies highlighting the \"white male effect.\" Again and again, studies find that white men are more likely to dismiss the risks of climate change. White men tend to earn more money. They tend to be more conservative. In general, they feel less vulnerable to environmental risks and are less likely to support environmental regulation. It would appear that white men oppose changing a system that largely benefits white men. \"What you’re seeing there is that basically everybody else is normal. White males are abnormal,\" said Akerlof. \"They’re not recognizing the true risks because they’re so invested in the system that they do not want to see anything that would threaten the current status quo.\" Cesar Chavez, 1972. CREDIT: Environmental Protection Agency What social scientists find in the data, many Latinos have long felt. Mexican-American labor leader Cesar Chavez gave voice to this idea in a 1970 essay for Playboy magazine. \"It’s amazing how people can get so excited about a rocket to the moon and not give a damn about smog, oil leaks, the devastation of the environment with pesticides, hunger, disease,\" Chavez wrote. \"When the poor share some of the power that the affluent now monopolize, we will give a damn.\" Climate change will be a defining issue for the next generation of Latinos. As the demographics shift and Hispanics make up a larger portion of American society, expect public opinion to follow suit.

              "  'context': 'Mom pumps breast milk for her friend’s adopted baby after her own infant daughter passed away Donating breast milk is a gracious act. But feeding your friend’s adopted baby after the loss of your own infant is more than gracious — it’s entirely selfless. This story of a grieving mom deciding to donate breast milk to her friend is so deeply moving, and something not every mom would have the strength to do. Today contributor Lauren Casper told the heartbreaking and incredibly touching story of friend Sarah Rieke’s decision to donate her breast milk to Casper’s adopted daughter Arsema. The friends were expecting their children together, with Casper awaiting adoption of a baby girl from Ethiopia and Rieke 20 weeks pregnant. The day of the \"big\" ultrasound, the friends excitedly anticipated news of the little one’s sex. Casper writes, \"I was secretly hoping for the news to come back that she was having a girl. I was dreaming about our daughters being great friends, just like their big brothers are. The text came... girl... but there were complications.\" As it turned out, those complications weren’t compatible with life and as Casper says, \"I prepared my nursery for the homecoming of my daughter and Rieke planned a funeral.\" Yet, her friend was still supportive, even in this time of unimaginable grief. She writes, \"We spent a lot of mornings together crying and talking and even laughing at times. She threw me a baby shower and gave me two blankets out of a packet of four... the other two would be wrapped around her daughter after she was born.\" Shortly after Arsema was brought home from Ethiopia, her friend approached her with a heartfelt offer. Rieke said, \"I was wondering if you would like to have my breast milk after Evie is born. I thought maybe you could use it to feed Arsema. I don’t know how long I’ll pump or how much I’ll be able to produce, but I’d love to give it to you if you want it.\" Rieke’s daughter, named Evie Caris, was born the month after Arsema came home and lived for just four hours. Only a week after her baby passed, the grieving mom made good on her offer and started bringing milk to her friend’s baby every week. Of the selfless act, Casper wrote, \"Each time I filled Arsema’s bottle and sat in the rocker to feed her I would think about Sarah and Evie. I would pray for Sarah’s broken heart and thank God for the gift Sarah had so selflessly given me and my daughter.\" She further explains that her friend wanted to do something \"meaningful\" and it seemed pumping for Arsema was healing for her in a way, as she grieved the loss of her own baby girl. In giving Arsema her milk, she provided a gift Casper couldn’t give her children. \"She knew one of the painful losses of infertility and adoption was my inability to breastfeed my children. They each had such a rough start in life and I wish I could have been able to at least give them that.\" To some, it might be hard to understand how a mom could have pumped milk for another baby only days after losing her own, but if you’re a parent, her probably reasons come into focus rather quickly. She likely wanted a connection to her child and to feel she had some impact on the world, no matter how small. By pumping the milk that was meant for her daughter and allowing it to nourish another baby, it kept Evie’s memory alive in some way. And gave a beautiful gift to a friend, establishing a bond they’ll have for the rest of their lives. Of Rieke’s selfless act, Casper writes, \"I wish I could have breastfed my children. Sarah wishes she could have fed her daughter (and so do I... oh so do I). But life doesn’t always make sense. When everything is broken and mixed up, we have to create our own beauty from the pieces.\" And that’s exactly what these friends did.

How do highly successful people maintain their motivation and continue to chase their toughest goals through an entire year? A reader named John recently contacted me with a similar question. He wrote, I'm currently working in investment management, a challenging job and a competitive environment that requires extra hours. Also, studying for the CFAan average of two to three hours a day for six months. This is doable without any doubt, but how can someone keep the same energy and motivation? At this time of year, you may be asking a similar question. Perhaps you're reflecting on the past year and wondering why you weren't able to stay focused on your goals from 11 months ago. Or perhaps you're planning your New Year's Resolution for 2017 and wondering how you'll stay motivated long enough to actually accomplish it. Many Ways To Drive Motivation They say, success leaves clues and I've had the opportunity to spend time with many self-made millionaires, Olympians, Marine Corps generals, Fortune 500 CEOs, Navy SEALS, Congressmen, and countless other high achievers. But before I reveal the single most effective motivation technique, let me acknowledge that there are many things that can help you drive and maintain motivation. For example: Goal Setting And The Goldilocks Rules goal setting is one of the most powerful psychological tools we have, but the trick is in setting the right The great thinker and writer James Clear calls this the Goldilocks Rule. If your goal is too hard, it will lose its power as you consciously or unconsciously determine it's just unrealistic. If you set your goal too low, it will also lose its power as you will assume you'll hit it no matter what. As Clear writers, humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. Higher Purpose Despite the innate power of goal setting, a longer lasting fuel for motivation is having a higher purpose. Simon Sinek has popularized the concept of knowing your Why. It's your true purpose or belief that inspires you. Whether your motivation is to lose weight, stop smoking, get out of debt or launch a new business, ask yourself why you want to do that. In fact, ask several why's in a row and you might be surprised at your answer. Accountability Partner who can help you to keep your commitments? It's easy to break a promise to yourself, but far harder to admit your failure to a friend or colleague. Ideally, your partner is on the journey with you. Perhaps a running buddy who meets you in the park at 6:00 AM, or a fellow writer who tracks her daily word counts. But even an independent observer can sway your behavior. I have my assistant ask daily, Did you work out? How many clean meals did you eat? How many hours did you write? How many thank you notes did you send out? She actually tracks my data on an Excel spreadsheet and shares back the results and trends each month. The #1 Way To Stay Motivated While there are many great tools to drive and maintain motivation, one is more important than all the others. What is it? Prime your body. The reality is that you live inside your body. Motivation, a mental state, is influenced by environment. And the environment of your mind is your body. Think about it: how motivated do you feel when you have a high fever? How motivated do you feel when you have stomach flu? How motivated do you feel when you have a migraine headache? Motivation can only be maintained when you feel energized physically. Four Ways To Maximize Physical Energy First, focus on quality sleep not quantity of sleep. Just yesterday I was watching a Facebook Live video from fitness guru, Joe Wicks. Someone asked what he thought of pre-workout energy drinks (many hardcore workout folks drink high caffeine energy drinks to maximize their effort during their work outs). Wicks answer, The best pre-work is a good night's sleep. For my productivity book, I interviewed 13 Olympic athletes about their productivity routines and almost all of them talked about sleep as recovery. Yes, ideally you should get eight hours of sleep but for most of us, that isn't just realistic. But you can improve your deep sleep, which is the sleep cycle that is most restorative. You are likely waking up many times throughout the night without realizing it. Think of your bedroom as a sleep sanctuary. What can you do to make sure the temperature is just right, and that it's as dark and quiet as possible? Room darkening blinds are ideal, but a good sleep mask can do the trick, too. Telling your partner to keep the TV off in the bedroom is a must, and don't forget to tell your teenagers when you are going to bed so they can keep it down too. Second, drink a lot of water. When you wake up you are already about 1% dehydrated, and most of us never fully hydrate. Studies show that even mild dehydration leads to loss of focus, decision making, creativity and yes, energy. You'd be surprised at how much water you need to keep your mind at its best. Remember the phrase, half you hydration. This means you should take your body weight (in pounds) and divide it in half, and that's the number of ounces of water you should take in each day. I weigh 170 pounds right now, so I divide that by two, and get 85. I drink 85 ounces of water a day. That's a lot of water! To help, I use a Nalgene water bottle and throw a few lemon slices and cucumbers in for a bit of flavor. On the weekends I'll just carry a gallon jug of water with me throughout the day with the goal to empty it. Three, don't skip meals. Your new mantra: Food is fuel! There is probably nothing more controversial in the health and fitness world than what and when to eat. High protein diets, vegan diets, bullet proof coffee for ketosis, fasting days, so many options! For myself, if I want to optimize for motivation and energy (not rapid weight loss) I consume five small slow-carb meals a day. I used to skip breakfast thinking I was saving time and calories, then I'd binge lunch of a sandwich or slice of pizza, and wolf down a big dinner of whatever. What I experienced was wild swings of glucose the fuel for your brain as I'd go from waking up to low glucose to flooding my body with carbs, and then the inevitable carb crash. I'm at my best when I'm eating similar to a Body for Life plan or a Tim Ferriss slow-carb diet plan. Fourth, daily exercise. Don't panic, just move! You don't have to become a hardcore Crossfit'er (although kudos if you are). You don't have to spend an hour a day in a gym (although that would be awesome). You just need to move in a way that gets your heart beat way up for twenty minutes a day. For most people, a vigorous walk around the neighborhood or on the treadmill each morning does the trick. A yoga session or after work pickup basketball game is great. This isn't for long-term health benefits, although there are. You are moving for 20-minutes a day for same-day energy and clarity. Research is clear, 20-minutes of cardiovascular activity increases blood flow to the brain and gives you an immediate boost of energy, clarity, focus, and creativity. Whether you are just trying to power through long days of work and family, or you are trying to crush your New Year's resolution, to maintain mental motivation, focus on your body. -- Kevin Kruse is the author of 15 Secrets Successful People Know About Time Management .

We recently spoke to Gordon about her upcoming Body/Head album with free-noise guitarist Bill Nace. \"I do find myself watching a lot of shows about women in crisis,\" Gordon said. \"Like \\'Scandal.\\' I think I relate to this idea of having to hold all of these things together and having a million things going on.\" Kim Gordon Will Appear On Season 3 Of \\'Girls\\' And We Can\\'t Wait',\n",

The areas where misunderstanding did occur were for the most part reasonable. The classic poop emoji? Seventy-six percent nailed it, but 18 percent looked at that swirly 💩 and thought ice cream. The peach emoji, commonly used to refer to a butt, fared a little worse with 42 percent thinking it meant \"feeling peachy\" and 35 percent thinking it was just a general fruit. This would help explain any 🍑💩 texts from the parents — who doesn\\'t love peach ice cream, after all?   The eggplant emoji, on the other hand, is apparently in need of a PR push.  SEE ALSO: Instagram won\\'t let us interact with the eggplant emoji Sixty-nice percent (insert obligatory \"nice\") believed that 🍆 referred to either cooking eggplant or vegetables. And, well, while they\\'re not wrong exactly the youngsters of the world know what it really means.

This is what Tickle-Me-Elmo thinks of the fact that your deranged, barbaric consumerism allowed your mind to go there even for a second: (via YouTube) While we're with Elmo on this one -- and you really should be too -- hordes of people around the nation must be at least a little less sure. They're preparing to camp out in frigid temperatures outside big box stores, waiting to join the crush of humanity as it flows through the aisles, carrying away the best deals on products that they never really needed in the first place. Black Friday can seem ridiculous, but it's no joke. Every year, seemingly unfathomable things happen on the day after Thanksgiving, including deaths and injuries. The first casualty of modern times came in 2008, when a New York Walmart worker was killed in a stampede of frenzied shoppers. Five years later, Walmart still hasn't paid a fine for its employee's death. In 2011, Black Friday shoppers ignored a collapsed comrade, leaving him to die as they rushed the store hunting for sales. A year later, would-be customers exchanged gunfire outside a store after a dispute over a parking spot. Two were wounded. If you think that's bad, it's only getting worse. This year, the deals are starting earlier than ever, with many stores opening their doors to the masses on Thanksgiving Day, thereby forcing workers and enabling shopping obsessed consumers to give up their holiday. Look, we understand the desire to get Christmas shopping out of the way as early and as cheaply as possible.

The grand total was $4 billion, about twice what it was supposed to cost, and more than the skyscraper adjacent to it. But there might be another record-breaking figure associated with this project. I couldn’t believe how much the architect got paid. The Real Deal has a lovely graphic that breaks down the final costs of the WTC Hub. The story explains some of the budgetary increases, mostly due to the many (many) changes the design needed to undergo. Which is understandable, I think, and pretty normal for these big public projects. So some of these figures seem large, but reasonable. $355 million to integrate the subway line? Okay. $32.1 million for a skylight? Fine, I guess. But then you get to the design fees. According to The Real Deal, architect Santiago Calatrava was paid $80 million to design the WTC Hub. The total design fees were $408.5 million. Calatrava’s cut was $80 million. For perspective, $80 million is the adjusted-for-inflation cost to build Grand Central Terminal. I’ve written about architecture for a long time, and I’ve tried very hard to think about another project that so famously ballooned over budget. I’d have to guess this is one of the largest fees ever paid to an architect, and I wonder if it was money well-spent. I’m not being one of those \"my six-year-old can design a better train station\" people—I don’t doubt Calatrava’s skill (even if it’s not suited to my particular taste) and I’m sure he had a lot of people working on the project for a long time who should also be paid well. And I do agree that the city deserves great infrastructure; if anything should be $4 billion, it should be a public building. But. BUT. That’s just it—this is public money. As some have mentioned, the Port Authority has a deal to turn part of the station into a mall which is not open yet, and so some of that money will be recouped. But there’s also the fact that Calatrava’s buildings are infamously nightmarish when it comes to maintenance. Maybe he can pay for any repairs out of his own pocket.

In light of Farrah Abraham\\'s inability to distinguish between feminism and small birds lesbianism, we did some research on other famous ladies who need a little help with the positive and empowering meaning of the term. There are plenty of female celebrities who are proud to advocate for the advancement of women, but not so proud to call themselves feminists. In many cases, it\\'s unclear whether they are unsure what the word means or perhaps just afraid to say it. We\\'ve rounded them up for your ideological scrutiny. But first, let\\'s go over some \"f-word\" FAQs. Can you just give me a definition of feminism? Well, feminism refers to a nexus of ideological movements, and applying a strict definition can be constricting if not reductive, but a clear definition explains the term as \"the advocacy of women\\'s rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.\" The key word here is \"advocacy\" insofar as it encourages the advancement of women. Wait, so are feminists mostly lesbians who don\\'t shave their armpits? I really don\\'t see what about that definition I just gave could possibly make you ask about armpits, but: no. There are hairy lesbian feminists, but the term has literally nothing to do with physical appearance (or lack of shaving). I also heard something about all feminists being pimply sluts. Is that true? Pretty sure you made the pimply part up. Also, no. One major aspect of the feminist movement is the fight against slut-shaming or the oppression of women\\'s ability to express their sexuality in a male-dominated culture. There are a number of double standards, perhaps the most prevalent being the idea that a man who is sexually active is a \"pimp,\" and a woman who is sexually active is a \"whore.\" That\\'s some real crap! Totally agree. Wait, but ... if that\\'s true, and feminists aren\\'t hairy lesbian sluts, then this kind of sounds like a good thing! It is definitely is! Yeah, but then why do so few people call themselves feminists? I\\'m so glad you asked. See, the thing is, \"feminism\" is plagued by a negative stigma that often persists even for those who work as advocates for women. A lot of it boils down to fear of a word, and that becomes problematic for the spreading of the idea. Some really great lady people seem to be either ignorant or concerned about their reputation when it comes to placing a label on their actions. Really? Like who? Well, as Salon noted, there are a few. A number of celebrities would rather be called \"humanists,\" and many are just hesitant, but some are proud to call themselves the \"f-word.\" Here are some strong celebrity women who have shared their relation to the word \"feminism\": Katy Perry: \"I am not a feminist, but I do believe in the strength of women.\" Carrie Underwood: \"I wouldn\\'t go so far as to say I am a feminist, that can come off as a negative connotation. But I am a strong female.\" Madonna: \"I’m not a feminist, I’m a humanist.\" Hmm, where have we heard that before? Sarah Jessica Parker: \"I took a page from [the playwright] Wendy Wasserstein\\'s book. She said \\'I\\'m not a feminist, I\\'m a humanist.\\'\" Demi Moore: \"I am a great supporter of women, but I have never really thought of myself as a feminist, probably more of a humanist because I feel like that’s really where we need to be.\" Taylor Swift : \"I don’t really think about things as guys versus girls. I never have. I was raised by parents who brought me up to think if you work as hard as guys, you can go far in life.\" Bjork:: \"[I don\\'t identify as a feminist] because I think it would isolate me. I think it’s important to do positive stuff. It’s more important to be asking than complaining.\" Beyoncé : \"That word [feminist] can be very extreme ... I guess I am a modern-day feminist. I do believe in equality ... Why do you have to choose what type of woman you are? Why do you have to label yourself anything? I’m just a woman, and I love being a woman.\" [Although, Bey does have to label herself, we know what term she\\'d use: \"I need to find a catchy new word for feminism, right? Like \\'bootylicious.\\'\"] Lady Gaga: \"I’m not a feminist. I hail men, I love men, I celebrate American male culture – beer, bars, and muscle cars.\" [Note: Gaga later told the LA Times she is a \"little bit of a feminist.\"] Despite all the denial (and confusion), there are some loud and proud feminists among the Hollywood elite... Amy Poehler: \"Aw, I feel bad if [Taylor Swift] was upset [following that joke I made at the Golden Globes]. I am a feminist, and she is a young and talented girl.\" Rashida Jones: \"I would [call myself a feminist], yes. I believe in the unadulterated advancement of women. And we have so far to go still. I do think because women are so clever and flexible and such good communicators, it been hard for men to evolve and keep up. I think we could do a little better to help them out.\" Lena Dunham: \"The idea of being a feminist—so many women have come to this idea of it being anti-male and not able to connect with the opposite sex—but what feminism is about is equality and human rights. For me that is just an essential part of my identity. I hope [\"Girls\"] contributes to a continuance of feminist dialogue.\" Ellen Page: \"I don\\'t know why people are so reluctant to say they\\'re feminists. Maybe some women just don\\'t care.

The 47-year-old host of Tucker Carlson Tonight joined the network just two months ago as a replacement for outgoing host Greta van Susteren. His 7 p.m. show has been a hit, averaging 2.8 million total viewers and posting strong ratings in the key 18-49 demo, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Carlson will begin hosting the 9 p.m. hour on Monday, January 9. Kelly’s last day at the network is Friday, January 6. \"In less than two months, Tucker has taken cable news by storm with his spirited interviews and consistently strong performance,\" Fox News chief Rupert Murdoch said in a statement. \"Viewers have overwhelmingly responded to the show and we look forward to him being a part of Fox News’ powerful primetime line-up.\" The move to 9 p.m. on cable’s most-watched network is Carlson’s biggest television gig yet; he hosted CNN’s The Spin Room and later, its innovative talk show Crossfire, before moving on to MSNBC for several years with his own show, called The Situation with Tucker Carlson, later renamed Tucker. In 2010, he founded the conservative news website The Daily Caller. The Drudge Report was the first to report the news of Carlson’s promotion. Meanwhile, Martha MacCallum will take over Carlson’s 7 p.m. slot with a new show titled The First 100 Days, which will center on President Donald Trump’s first three months in office, and Fox News reporter Shannon Bream will appear on America’s Newsroom opposite Bill Hemmer. \"Martha is a versatile and skilled anchor who has proven to be an essential component of our news programming. For the last 12 years, our viewers have trusted her reporting and we are pleased she will be part of our primetime line-up for the first 100 days of the new presidency,\" Murdoch said in a statement. Kelly, one of Fox News’s two biggest stars next to Bill O’Reilly, is leaving the network for her own daytime news show and Sunday night newsmagazine show on NBC.

Then when they found out they had broken the law, they kinda sorta corrected the error but didn’t actually follow their legal obligation to get the money back. It’s all at least a little suspicious. The story includes the phrase: \"Trump staffers said that a series of unusual — and unrelated — errors by people working for Trump had led to both the improper donation and to the omission of that donation from the foundation\\'s tax filings.\" What’s more, the contribution to Bondi came right when she was one of several attorneys general who were looking into possible Trump University fraud investigations. Shortly after receiving the illegal campaign contribution she dropped the investigation. Oh, also, it turns out that the Trump Foundation itself was part of a setup to ensure that Trump’s own money was never used to finance a Trump charitable contribution. In the grand scheme of the 2016 campaign this seems like maybe not that big of a deal.

In 2015, researchers at Time went through 35 years of FAA data, attempting to identify where in an aeroplane the safest seats were. They found, after limiting their research to 17 accidents since 1985, that seats in the rear third of the aircraft had a lower fatality rate (32 per cent) than seats in the middle (39 per cent) and front (38 per cent) of the plane. In 2007, Popular Mechanics looked at survival rates for every commercial crash in the US since 1971. This research also found that the rear seats were safest. Survival rates for these seats were 69 per cent compared to 56 per cent over the wing and 49 per cent at the front of the plane. These investigations go against the aircraft manufacturers: A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said: It's an age-old question. There's just no way to say.

In a recent poll concluded by the Pokémon Company in which Japanese fans were asked who among the 721 Pokémon was their favorite, Greninja claimed the No. 1 spot. The water-dark type Pokémon from the Pokémon X and Pokémon Y series reportedly garnered 15 percent of the total votes from more than about 500,000 voters. Greninja is a large frog-like Pokémon that evolves from Frogadier and is the third and final evolution of Froakie. Reports suggest that the Pokémon’s victory above the other 721 Pokémon, most especially Pikachu, may be attributed to Greninja’s recent appearances in various media. Greninja has been seen in the Pokémon anime series as one of Ash’s own and has a special transformation called Ash-Greninja. The Pokémon has been added to the Super Smash Bros. as one of the playable and formidable characters and has even been dubbed as a rare Amiibo character. These combined allegedly boosted Greninja’s popularity among Japanese fans. Pikachu, on the other hand, didn't even place in the top three, landing in the fourth spot right after psychic Pokémon Mew, and the legendary Pokémon God, Arceus, in third and second places, respectively. Coming in after Pikachu up to the 10th spot in order are Sylveon, Genesect, Rayquaza, Zygarde in its 50 percent form, Charizard, and Meloetta in its Aria form. Series originals Charmander and Squirtle didn’t make it to the list. Bulbasaur, however, landed on the 89th spot. The Pokémon General Election 720 voting event is a marketing campaign for the company’s upcoming new movie release, Pokémon X Y & Z.

It all went down after the DNC, when Larry Sanders stopped the whole show to cast his vote for his brother, and reports are Hillary was FURIOUS. Or, no... that’s some bullshit. What did you think the payoff for this clickbait headline would be? That Hillary ordered him kicked out of the party? You’ve likely seen a lot of headlines like this in the past year. You may well have clicked on many of them. Today I’d like to talk to you about how bullshit managed to infect this primary, and continues to consume our politics. The art of a headline like this is simple: I took someone beloved (Larry Sanders, who spoke so movingly at the DNC on behalf of his brother) and I combined it with a large dose of schadenfreude — the pleasure we take in other peoples’ suffering. Or in this case, maybe the better word is cynicism: the pleasure we take in believing the worst about people. There are many, many people in the world who want to be told bad things about Hillary Clinton — particularly underhanded nasty things that victimize the progressive left — and that is a desire that’s easy to manipulate. I could have also gone with the headline, \"You Won’t Believe What Trump Ordered the RNC to do to the Khan Family!\" The art of good headline writing and image selection in order to get someone to click and go to a website is usually called \"clickbaiting,\" but I think we should call it \"bullshit curation.\" And this primary, the bullshit curators made a massive cottage industry out of your desire to read nasty things about Hillary Clinton. So much so that people still believe things that are patently untrue. Let’s start with USUncut.com. Why does this website exist? Years ago, it was a tax advocacy group working against austerity measures. But last year, its founders left the organization according to their Linkedin profiles. There’s no \"about\" section on the site. No masthead. No statement of purpose. A critical tenet of journalism is that you have to know who the journalists are — that they are real people whose agenda you can measure. You know who owns Fox News. You know who reports for it. You are able to draw conclusions about their agenda based on what you know about them. Sites like USUncut, however, have unclear ownership and unclear loyalties. And apart from this guy , its bullshit curators don’t seem to have any social media footprint — no Facebook or Twitter presence. Maybe they are real journalists who have managed to avoid having a byline in any publication prior to USUncut. Maybe they are real people who have never made a Facebook or Twitter or LinkedIn profile — or who keep those profiles secret. Or maybe they’re freelance writers hired by a click farm to gin up the most salacious headlines possible atop rehashed versions of other peoples’ stories. Under the terms of \"fair use,\" journalism commenting on someone else’s story is protected use of that person’s story, so the game here is simple: A) Real news source breaks story B) Write a story pulling a couple lines from the real news source and commenting on them, generally by slanting them in the direction your readers want to hear C) Add the most outrageous headline you can come up with paired with an image that feeds the interpretation your readers are likely to have of that headline Voila! You’ve taken someone else’s work and made a commentary piece that people are more likely to click on because the headline is sexier than the responsible original piece. By way of example, let’s look at this story: Did that actually happen? Do you know? Don’t google it. Do you know if the DNC committee rejected an amendment to eliminate superdelegates? If you’re like me, you likely saw this headline half a dozen times on friends’ news feeds. Maybe more. You likely have lodged in your head that superdelegates are going to continue as they were this primary, no change, because the evil DNC and Hitlery Klingon blocked any reform or change. But that’s not what happened. Both campaigns worked together and compromised and have formed an ongoing committee to change the rules Could there be any headline less sexy than \"ongoing committee to change the rules is formed\"? But there is no follow up to this headline on USUncut. We got the bullshit, but none of the fact. (UPDATE! I was totally wrong! I SUCK! Here was their follow on piece which I searched for and could not find.) You probably also saw headlines like this: Remember that one? The DNC blocked EVERYTHING Sanders worked for. None of it made it into the platform. NONE. They voted down every last one of his initiatives. Well, wait a minute. Did they? Here’s conservative bastion, The Nation , on how Sanders and his minority on the platform committee achieved multiple major victories in writing the platform. Victories that Sanders then recited in his speech at the DNC. Did they get everything? No. Was it super political? Yes. Did they win on more fronts than they lost? Yes. There’s a lot of nuance there. Terrible for clickbait. And yet, the perception that the DNC threw all of Sanders’ proposals out was so real going into the convention that many of his own supporters thought he wasn’t telling the truth when he said they’d created the most progressive platform in the Democratic Party’s history. There weren’t any follow up stories on sites like US Uncut setting the record straight, except one citing the inclusion of a $15 Minimum Wage (if you’ll recall, multiple sites ran stories about how Clinton’s people had killed the $15 Minimum Wage in the committee as well). Like the Dude, the bullshit abides. Bullshit curation is dangerous. Unless you are constantly reading minute to minute news, and from multiple sources, it is quite easy for these explosive headlines to stick in the consciousness and become truth. Don’t believe me? Look at what has happened to the right wing in this country. They have been in a curated bullshit echo chamber for a decade, and now live in a fundamentally different reality than the rest of us, where crime goes down in the real world, but up in theirs; the Earth gets hotter in the real world, yet never changes in theirs; presidents are born in Hawaii in the real world, but are provably from Kenya in theirs. Why do the curators do it? Well, the answer seems very clear: the better and more cynical the headline and image pairing, the more clicks. The more clicks, the more revenue from the dozens of ads that appear on each page: There is real value to owning a site that can reliably drive hundreds of thousands of people to look at an article. By becoming a well-liked curator of bullshit, you get even more viewership for your bullshit, which means the bullshit has to keep coming — and in more refined form. By the end of the primary, there were many sites delivering the bullshit equivalent of pure-grade heroin. So, why have I told you all this? Because I’d like to challenge you to look at news in a different way. Here are some rules: • Only believe primary sources. If you can hear a candidate saying it, the candidate said it. Don’t believe anyone’s description of what the candidate meant. Judge for yourself. Listen to the words. That means: Only believe primary sources. If you can hear a candidate saying it, the candidate said it. Don’t believe anyone’s description of what the candidate meant. Judge for yourself. Listen to the words. That means: • Don’t believe anything your friends say. Seriously, your friends don’t know anything. Unless they were there personally and heard it themselves, why are you taking their opinion as truth? Don’t believe anything your friends say. Seriously, your friends don’t know anything. Unless they were there personally and heard it themselves, why are you taking their opinion as truth? • Don’t believe stories about a \"guy who heard\" the candidate say something. My friends in the military are awash in stories about terrible things Clinton supposedly said to her security details. None of these stories has ever been confirmed. Similarly, don’t believe the things people heard Trump said once to a guy in a car. Don’t believe stories about a \"guy who heard\" the candidate say something. My friends in the military are awash in stories about terrible things Clinton supposedly said to her security details. None of these stories has ever been confirmed. Similarly, don’t believe the things people heard Trump said once to a guy in a car. • Read well-sourced journalism that relies on primary sources. Read well-sourced journalism that relies on primary sources. • Judge the words and actions of the candidates yourself. Should you judge Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump for the things they say? Yes. Should you decide whether you believe them? Yes. Should you read up on policies they enacted and judge them for those policies? Yes. But very importantly: should you judge them based on policies people tell you they actually believe in, but have never said they do nor have ever acted on? No. That is called a conspiracy theory. If you are on the progressive left, you are generally suspicious (I am guessing) of people trying to sell you things. The corporate media is a great example of this — they lie, many of us believe, to keep up viewership and sell ad time. It is, therefore, astonishing to me that the bullshit curators had such a powerful influence on the progressive left this cycle. Why did they write these salacious headlines? Who do they work for? It certainly seems like they’re out to make a quick buck. Why aren’t you more suspicious of anonymous people on the Internet telling you things than you are of Jake Tapper? It’s time to grow a little more suspicious of Internet headlines, folks. Remember, only you can prevent bullshit. UPDATE: Several people have QUITE RIGHTLY called me out for only focusing on USUncut. I find them immensely irritating and so I focused on them. But by no means does that mean they’re the only offender. They’re probably not even the worst offender. You can find many other sites that have used this tactic — and sites that have used knee-jerk defensiveness on Hillary’s behalf to drive clicks. The phenomenon I’m talking about is in no way limited to sites that supported Bernie, and I should have been clearer about that. The right wing has sites doing this, the middle does, the left does. If someone is passionate on a subject, there are sites manipulating that passion to drive clicks. And I know The Nation is not a conservative bastion. It was a joke.

              "  'context': 'A woman in Goldsboro, N.C., found a body in a deep freezer she bought from her neighbor. She was told to wait for a church to pick up items left in the freezer, but when the church never came, \"I decided to open it,\" the unidentified woman said. The seller has left town, and the body parts were sent to authorities to identify. (Reuters) When the Goldsboro, N.C., resident spotted the freezer at her neighbor’s yard sale last month, she thought she was getting a good deal. The neighbor was charging $30 for a deep freezer with a hinged lid — the kind of freezer large enough for someone to climb inside. But the neighbor said there was a caveat, she recalled to WNCN. She couldn’t start using the freezer immediately because the neighbor had promised to lend it out to her church’s Sunday school class for a \"time capsule\" project. The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, says her neighbor told her the church would come to pick up the items inside the freezer, which was sealed shut with duct tape. Afterwards, the buyer was supposed to get the freezer back. So the woman waited. Three weeks passed; the church members never came. \"Nothing was adding up, so I started to become suspicious about it,\" the woman told WRAL. She was keeping the freezer plugged in in the corner of a spare bedroom, alongside houseplants, an armchair, a vacuum cleaner and spare toiletries. Last Friday, she peeled off the duct tape and looked inside. The first things the woman saw were a green sheet and a bag of kitty litter, she told WTVD. Then, her eyes landed on a human foot. \"I saw toes and a foot and ankle,\" the woman said. She slammed the freezer shut. It must be fake, she thought to herself, opening the lid again. This time, she was sure it was real. \"My heart went into my throat,\" the woman told WRAL. She ran out of the house and called 911. \"I have a serious problem,\" she told the 911 dispatcher. \"My neighbor sold me a deep freezer. I just opened it and there’s a body in there I think.\" \"Your neighbor sold it to you?\" the dispatcher asked. \"I am freaking out,\" she responded, short of breath. \"I understand, ma’am,\" said the dispatcher. \"Your neighbor sold it to you?\" \"Yes,\" she said. The Goldsboro Police Department said in a statement on Wednesday that an autopsy confirmed the freezer indeed contained human remains. The body belonged to a Goldsboro resident, but her identity is being withheld until next of kin can be notified, police said. The medical examiner determined that there were no signs of foul play and her death was natural. The police are investigating. Concealing the death of a person is a felony, and disposal of bodies is controlled by state hygiene and environmental laws. The name of the original freezer owner has not been released. The woman who bought the freezer has a strong and disturbing suspicion: that her neighbor dumped her own mother’s dead body inside the freezer. The woman told WNCN that her neighbor’s elderly mother had lived with her, but she hadn’t seen her since September, when the mother had a stroke. The mother had interacted with the woman when she was sick, she told WTVD: \"I recognized the foot. It was her mother’s foot.\" Other neighbors said the freezer seller has since moved to West Virginia, where she told people she was visiting her mother at a nursing home. \"I think maybe the daughter was dependent on the mother’s check and didn’t know what else to do,\" the woman told WRAL. Speaking to WTVD, she said: \"I’m glad that I was the one who was chosen to be able to find her mother so that that poor woman can rest.\" Body in yard-sale freezer freaks out N.C. woman.

              "  'context': 'In Malawi a packet of sanitary towels can cost a whole day\\'s pay, and girls often miss school because the cotton strips they use instead are inadequate. Charlotte Ashton met a woman in Blantyre who\\'s come up with a solution. It\\'s a 14-year-old girl\\'s worst nightmare. You\\'re standing in front of your class when giggling erupts from the back and everyone\\'s pointing at your behind. With despair you realise your sanitary pad has leaked and an embarrassing circle of blood has appeared on your dress. I clearly remember the anxious checking of my school skirt as a teenager. You\\'d pull aside a close friend: \"Have I leaked?\" But the worst never actually happened and I don\\'t remember seeing it happen to any classmates. Because in the West we\\'re blessed with effective, disposable, affordable sanitary protection - the vast majority of us can afford pads or tampons every month. Here in Malawi, that\\'s not the case. The sanitary pads in the shops cost 500 Malawi kwacha (75 cents; 50p) per pack. That\\'s nearly a whole day\\'s pay at the minimum wage - and you really need two packs per period. Imagine spending two days\\' wages every month just on sanitary pads. To find out what women do instead, I head to a school in a township on the outskirts of Blantyre, Malawi\\'s second city, to talk periods with a group of teenage girls. \"Tell me,\" I venture. \"We\\'re here to talk about sanitary pads. Do any of you use the disposable ones?\" A row of shaking heads then a brave hand goes up. \"We take pieces of old chitenge and tear them into strips.\" Benku is 15 and bright-eyed. Chitenges the pieces of cotton material Malawian women wear around their waists. \"Then we fold them over and put them into our underwear.\" \"That must be uncomfortable,\" I ask. \"Yes,\" she agrees. \"Sometimes I get sores on my legs where the material rubs. And sometimes the chitenge falls out! \"That happened to me once in class. The boys were laughing. I was so embarrassed.\" Find out more From Our Own Correspondent has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, get the podcast or listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 The monthly burden doesn\\'t end there. The girls explain how they get up early or stay out late to wash the used strips - in a quiet moment when no-one\\'s around to see. Hanging them up to dry in the sun would be too public a display of an issue that\\'s taboo here. So the girls find a dark corner inside to dry their rags. And then the answer that I somehow found saddest of all: \"Do your mothers help you?\" Their heads shake again: \"No,\" says Benku\\'s friend. \"My mother asked my aunt to explain everything to me when I got my first period.\" Another girl was given an old chitenge and a lesson in what to do by a neighbour. A third was sent to her grandmother\\'s for a week. This monthly struggle has been the same for generations. But unlike their mothers, aunts and grandmothers these young women have a champion, who\\'s determined to tackle the problem. Image caption Trinitas holding a chitenge strip Trinitas is a tall, vivacious 31-year-old researcher at Blantyre\\'s College of Medicine. When six boys but only two girls turned up for a focus group she was running at this school, she asked the teacher where they all were and was told they\\'d excused themselves that week because they were menstruating. And that\\'s a whole other tragic side to this issue: girls often don\\'t leave the house while they\\'re bleeding. \"So how many days of school are you missing every month?\" I ask the group. \"Five, five, six, four, five,\" they tell me. Trinitas remembers this from her own schooldays and is angry that another generation of girls is suffering. She\\'s the daughter of a single mother and studied at a basic government school. Yet she beat the odds and made it to university - thanks, she says, to her mother\\'s insistence on the value of education. With that in mind Trinitas bought an old treadle sewing machine and started making reusable sanitary pads from fabrics available locally. She\\'s been doing market research at the school and the girls have all tried out her pads. The feedback is resoundingly positive. \"They\\'re so easy to wash!\" says one girl. \"The top layer is lovely and fleecy so they\\'re comfortable,\" says another. Trinitas\\'s challenge is to get capital investment in this chronically poor country - enough to scale up production and bring down the price so it\\'s low enough for the average Malawian. The girls are clearly excited by the new freedom this product could afford them. \"The wings and the poppers mean I can move around as usual,\" chirps one. \"We can do skipping rope and everything.\" And with that I\\'m reminded that these schoolgirls deserve better than a week of discomfort and humiliation every single month.

              "  'context': 'Waze, the smartphone traffic and navigation app used by more than 50 million drivers, may actually make some commutes a little longer starting Friday -- all in the name of safety. It\\'s also considering a feature to warn drivers about routes that go through high-crime neighborhoods. Users in Los Angeles (and soon in New Orleans) will get an alert that their Waze has changed how it maps their route to work. The app will no longer direct drivers to cross over or turn through busy intersections that lack a stop sign or a light, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave. In what some Waze users call a \"suicide straight,\" the app would sometimes direct drivers across multiple lanes of heavy traffic. Another concern for some is when Waze suggests a left turn through that same multi-lane traffic without a light. But Waze\\'s Amber Kirby says, not anymore. Starting first in Los Angeles, the app may sacrifice a little time for safety. When CBS News drove with the new feature in Santa Monica, Waze had us turn left on a lightly-trafficked side street instead of across the much busier Lincoln Boulevard, sending us to a stop sign and a less stressful right turn. \"Do you guys have a sense for what this is going to do to people\\'s commute?\" Van Cleave asked. \"How much longer is it going to make my drive to work?\" \"If you are commuting 40 minutes to an hour, maybe it adds a couple minutes here and there,\" Kirby said. \"Do you worry that some people are going to say, \\'But you\\'re supposed to save me time. And now you\\'re costing me two minutes?\\'\" Van Cleave asked. \"They can then either opt to turn it off, or they can make the turn anyway. ... Waze will reroute you,\" Kirby explained. That\\'s one of several changes the Waze team is considering. In Brazil, an elderly woman was murdered after she entered an incorrect address and was routed into a neighborhood known for gang violence. The company is now working on what could be a controversial next step, a new feature in that country to alert drivers about routes through high-crime areas. \"We\\'re working with the government, we\\'re working with local community groups who are able to identify which neighborhoods have safety issues,\" Waze head of brand Julie Mossler said. \"How do you do that in a way that isn\\'t labeling a community or a neighborhood a \\'bad neighborhood\\'?\" Van Cleave asked. \"Sometimes it\\'s a choice of words. So, \\'dangerous\\' is sort of a judgment, whereas \\'high-crime\\' is factual,\" Mossler said. Mossler said the feature would use crime data verified by a third party and could also be supported by data the app gathers from users, including reports of accidents, incidents and police presence. \"Crime data is notoriously unreliable,\" Ezekiel Edwards from the American Civil Liberties Union said. \"People would be relying on flawed data to make decisions about where to drive and where not to drive, with whom to engage and with whom not to engage, perhaps where to spend money, where not to spend money ... and further perpetuate inequalities among neighborhoods as a result,\" he added. But Waze\\'s Mossler said the company takes a risk in not acting, \"so we don\\'t really have a choice.\" \"Of course there\\'s a risk, if you don\\'t handle it correctly, and that\\'s why it\\'s gotta be done with deep sensitivity, and I think we\\'ve done that so far,\" Mossler said. That high-crime filter could be launched before the Brazil Olympics. Right now, there\\'s no timeline for it to come to the U.S. As for difficult intersections, this will be a default setting, so you\\'ll have opt out if you don\\'t want it. How much time it adds to a commute will depend on how long your commute is. Waze believes for most people, it will be less than a couple of minutes. After Los Angeles and New Orleans, the feature could also be in Boston and Washington, D.C. by the end of the year. Your commute could now get a bit longer with Waze',\n",

              "  'context': 'In a Surprise Move, Feminists Defending the Rights of the Convicted in California By Avens O’Brien In August, the state legislature of California passed a bill to approve imposing mandatory minimums in sexual assault cases. This bill came about after the surprisingly short six-month sentence of Brock Turner for three counts of felony sexual assault (he was let out after three months for good behavior). The bill is now awaiting California Governor Jerry Brown’s signature to become law – but there has been a considerable amount of backlash from a group one would generally expect to see in favor of harsher penalties: feminists. A coalition of 25 feminist organizations have submitted a letter to Governor Brown, urging a veto. From their letter: As student survivors of gender violence and their allies, we respectfully request that you veto AB 2888, which would institute a mandatory minimum sentence for any defendant found guilty of sexually assaulting an unconscious or intoxicated person. We know firsthand that the consequences of rape are no less damaging for a victim who is unconscious than for a victim who is not. We also know that mandatory minimum-term laws are a harmful, mistaken solution to our rightful anger over the Brock Turner case and the many others like it. Over the latter half of the 20th century, mandatory minimum laws have led to overly punitive sentencing and prison overcrowding. While some support this legislation in hopes that it will address racial biases in sentencing that worked in Turner’s favor, mandatory minimums have in fact exacerbated racial and class disparities in prosecution. Further, mandatory minimums can deter victims—the vast majority of whom were assaulted by a friend, partner, or family member—from reporting an assault and seeking resources. When survivors do come forward, mandatory minimums deter prosecutors from pressing charges against particular defendants—namely those who, like Turner, are white and wealthy—and make juries less likely to convict. Furthermore, mandatory minimum laws have failed to reduce assault. (Indeed, studies show that the severity of sanction does not deter violence.) Groups that signed the letter include Know Your IX, ACT for Women & Girls, Campus Assault Reponse (James Madison University), FIRSST (Goshen College), National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, National Resource Center on Domestic Violence, Social Justice Club (University of Wisconsin), URGE, UltraViolet, and many others. President of Brooklyn College, Michelle Anderson, stated \"I oppose the legislation,\" and \"I hope he [Governor Jerry Brown] does veto it....I think we have a history in this country of overreacting and overusing the criminal justice system. Feminists have been saying for years that mandatory punishments are not the right response to sexual violence.\" As a California resident, feminist activist, and opponent of the terrible way our criminal (in)justice system has been used to abuse our citizens, I have written to Governor Brown urging him to veto this bill. His contact information can be found here. On top of this letter, several others have come out against CA’s AB 2888: It’s encouraging to see so many standing up to this.

              "  'context': 'In 2007 Apple launched the iPhone, a product that would forever change the cell phone industry. It would set the bar by which all other phones were measured. It would topple giant companies and force every other player in the market to completely reinvent their product lines. It would grow to become the biggest moneymaker in Apple history, and allow the company to report the No. 1 and No. 2 most profitable quarters any company has ever reported. Now, a brand new product that is selling twice as fast the original iPhone has been widely deemed a flop. The Apple Watch got off to a rocky start thanks to what can only be categorized as an uncharacteristically messy product launch, but Apple quickly recovered and hit its stride. Despite being Apple’s first foray into a young new product category, estimates since the device’s launch have been very positive. Apple’s smartwatch quickly outsold every other smartwatch on the market, and sales are thought to have continued at a strong pace throughout the Watch’s first year on the market. According to analysts’ consensus ahead of Apple’s fiscal second-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, Apple is thought to have sold between 12 million and 13 million Apple Watches during the device’s first year of availability, The Wall Street Journal noted . That’s at least double the number of iPhones Apple sold in its first year on the market. It’s also good for about $6 billion in revenue assuming an average selling price of about $500. Despite a start that can only be classified as strong — the Apple Watch is already believed to account for 61% of global smartwatch sales — some high-profile analysts and industry watchers still insist on categorizing the device as a \"flop.\" Among them is Union Square Ventures cofounder Fred Wilson , who has been negative on the Apple Watch since before it was released. In a classic case of not being able to see the forest for the trees, even some of the smartest experts out there seem to think that any new market Apple enters is a failure unless it instantly rivals the iPhone in terms of revenue generation and profitability. Needless to say, this a horrible way to measure the success or failure of a new product line. Nothing will ever be as successful as the iPhone right out of the gate. The iPhone wasn’t even a smash hit right out of the gate, having sold just 6 million units in its first year on the market. To put that in perspective, Apple sold nearly 6 million iPhones each week during the holiday quarter last year. It’s still early days for the Apple Watch. It could become the next big thing for Apple down the road, but even if it doesn’t it’s already bringing in billions in additional revenue each quarter.

              "  'context': 'People have dreamed about interstellar travel for decades. Wouldn\\'t it be nice to escape political turmoil, climate change, overpopulation, and nuclear proliferation? Wouldn\\'t it be nice to move, with a few family members and friends, to a welcoming virgin world? Hollywood makes it seem easy. We strap in aboard our starliner, and the craft gently lifts off. A button is pushed. The star field distorts. The ship slips into a wormhole, and we take a shortcut through space-time to arrive in a new planetary system and a blue-green oasis. In reality, things aren\\'t that simple. We don\\'t know how to create a wormhole. Warping space requires immense energies — and forms of matter that might not exist. Space is so vast that if we were to depend on the conventional chemical propulsion systems that have taken us to the moon and other planets in our solar system, a voyage to the stars would last tens of thousands of years. It\\'s so frustrating! Just as astronomers locate potentially habitable planets around nearby stars, we\\'re reminded of the difficulty of visiting these worlds. Someday humans may be able to develop interstellar spacecraft powered by antimatter or fluctuations in the universal vacuum. (Antimatter combined with normal matter would be the most energetic possible rocket fuel. Tapping the universal vacuum implies a near-infinite energy source, if this proves possible.) But for now, let\\'s limit our view to proposed interstellar spacecraft powered by innovative propulsion techniques that do not violate the laws of physics as we now understand them. The first realistic possibility, initially proposed in 1968 by physicist Freeman Dyson, was a craft powered by successive explosions of hydrogen bombs (separated from the crew compartment by colossal shock absorbers). The proposed spacecraft, dubbed Project Orion, was huge, with dimensions measuring in kilometers. Powered by the entire thermonuclear arsenals of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, Dyson calculated, it would have been capable of sending thousands of human colonists to the Alpha/Proxima Centauri system (at 4.3 light-years from Earth, the closest star system) within 1,000 years or so. Starting in the 1970\\'s, scientists at the British Interplanetary Society and its offshoots, including the Institute for Interstellar Studies, proposed a series of interstellar probes and huge human-carrying space arks bearing classical names such as Daedalus and Icarus. These were essentially sanitized versions of Dyson\\'s Orion: Instead of hydrogen bombs, these conceptual craft were to have been propelled by small pellets of nuclear fusion fuel ignited by lasers or electron beams. These proposed craft were supposed to have been able to reach Alpha/Proxima Centauri within centuries. But the fusion apparatus would be massive. It would be difficult to fund preliminary developmental in-space experiments because of the immense ship sizes required. In the late 1970s, scientists started thinking about interstellar craft powered by not by chemical or nuclear processes but by \"propellantless\" systems. One of the most promising ideas is for craft propelled by the propulsive force of sunlight falling on a thin, highly reflective \"sail.\" Calculations indicate that such a system, pushed to its technological limits, could propel a robotic payload to Alpha/Proxima Centauri within only a few centuries. Human-carrying arks, whose speed would be bound by our bodies\\' limited ability to withstand the high g forces of rapid acceleration, would take about 1,000 years to complete the same journey. Unfortunately, the solar-photon sail has its limits. One is the inverse-square nature of solar luminosity: With every doubling of a ship\\'s distance from the sun, its acceleration would fall by a factor of four. But there may be a way around this limitation. During the next decade, a Silicon Valley billionaire named Yuri Milner intends to invest $100 million in the Breakthrough Initiative Project Starshot. His idea is to attach a tiny robotic payload to a super-thin, highly reflective sail measuring only about 100 square centimeters and hit it with a multi-gigawatt laser beam generated by a huge facility here on Earth. If scientists can find a way to keep it in the powerful beam for a few minutes without melting, it would fly off at a velocity sufficient to reach Alpha Centauri in a few decades. This is all very challenging. We\\'ll need to figure out how to keep the tiny sail stable in the powerful beam without melting, maintaining the beam on target during the multi-minute acceleration run, and reconfiguring the tiny sail for both interstellar cruise and encounter with the Centauri system — but it is by no means impossible. And at least for now, it may be our best chance we — or, rather, robots — have for reaching the stars.

Four years later, something rather incredible happened, and it doesn’t happen very often. Erica was pregnant again... with twins. That’s right — for a second time in less than five years, a second set of twins was on the horizon! And this time, they didn’t want to know the sex of the twins until the day of the delivery. In November 2014, Weston and Erica headed off to the hospital for induced labor. Doctors had to break Erica’s water because she was full-term at 38 weeks and a few days. Like a proud husband and father, Weston decided to document the big day. He filmed everything from the drive to the hospital and up until the magical moment the babies were delivered. The couple was surprisingly cool, calm and collected the whole way through. En route to the hospital, Erica looks at her husband and jokingly asks, \"Are you ready to have five kids?\" It’s too late to turn back now! As it turned out, Weston was more than prepared. He popped open the trunk to reveal a slew of electronics to capture the memories, like computers, an iPad, and a camera fitted with a GoPro. The result is a heartwarming and personal video that takes viewers along on this crazy ride. Weston says, \"The labor was insanely quick at only three hours from water breakage to newborns.\" My favorite moment is when the nurses break into a chorus of cheers after revealing the twins’ genders to Erica.

I was wary to discuss \"The Sopranos\" at all with Imperioli (who, of course, played mobster Christopher Moltisanti on David Chase\\'s acclaimed show) out of fear that since the subject comes up so many times in his day-to-day life he may just be over it by now. This is not the case. Imperioli\\'s eyes light up as he recounts tale after tale -- including an admission that he wasn\\'t a huge fan of the first script. Imperioli, who I met at his lower Manhattan hotel room, is now co-starring in Spike Lee\\'s \"Oldboy.\" He plays Chucky, a bar owner who helps his childhood friend, Joe (Josh Brolin), on a mysterious quest to find out who has imprisoned Joe for the last 20 years. The results are ... well, not really what you would expect (unless you\\'ve seen the Korean film on which \"Oldboy\" is based). Did you audition for \"Oldboy,\" or was the role offered? Spike called me -- I had worked for him a bunch of times. And he called out of the blue and had assumed that I had already gotten the offer from my agent, which I didn\\'t. So he called and said, \"I\\'m really psyched we\\'re working together again.\" And I\\'m like, \"What? What are we doing?\" He\\'s like \"Oldboy! You\\'re playing Josh Brolin\\'s best friend.\" I said, \"Spike, I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\" It\\'s interesting when Spike Lee makes a kind of movie that isn\\'t what he is most known for doing. Yeah, he is a filmmaker. Because when he started out, he was identified with being a \"black filmmaker.\" He was telling these stories and they were mostly black characters. They weren\\'t necessarily, like, \"She\\'s Gotta Have It,\" could be any race, it doesn\\'t matter. Because he really was at the forefront of a new kind of generation of cinema where a lot more African Americans were going to be making films. Originally, they started calling him \"the black Woody Allen,\" and he probably hated that title. But, that\\'s only a part of who he is ... he\\'s a lot of things and over the years, we\\'ve seen that his filmmaking and his art encompasses all of those things. Did you watch the original movie? No. This one I haven\\'t seen, either. I\\'m going to see it at the screening tonight here in New York, then I will see the original. There\\'s something I\\'ve always wondered. On \"The Sopranos\" you were playing younger... Yeah, my character was younger than me. After \"The Sopranos\" ended, did that ever affect you for other roles? That people assumed you were younger? I think people always thought I was more of a Guido than I am. That\\'s more the issue. They knew you were acting, right? Not necessarily. They kind of thought it was more like \"Jersey Shore\" when it came out. What? I\\'m not kidding! I think a lot of people thought that we were not necessarily even actors -- that they had found us in New Jersey and put us on television. I think a lot of people had that perception. Not after it had been on for awhile, right? No, no. At the beginning. That\\'s insane. A lot of people are insane [laughs]. And then they\\'d meet me and they would be kind of disappointed that they weren\\'t meeting Christopher. That\\'s fascinating. Sad but true. Like a lot of people, I recently watched all of \"The Sopranos\" again. It was better than I even remembered it was. Obviously David Chase\\'s vision of the whole thing, it\\'s beyond brilliant -- and really, really creative and amazing. But, in addition to that, I think the fact that it\\'s really funny. Like really. Like pee in your pants funny. And in an absurd, sometimes even slapstick way, which is great. But, there\\'s this kind of magic that happened with \"The Sopranos\" because a lot of the actors, for me, I knew and had worked with most of those people. Two of the actors, John Ventimiglia and Sharon Angela -- Johnny played Artie and Sharon played Rosalie Aprile -- I was in acting school with them when I was a teenager. I had done movies with Vinnie Pastore and Tony Sirico, and I know Edie Falco, we had done some stuff together. So, in some sense, it was kind of like this generation of New York actors having this moment to do it together, like as a band. Rather than something that was cast in Hollywood and you got a bunch of good actors and made a good TV show. So, there was that other added element of magic that I think happened. You\\'ve been on television shows since then. Can you tell when that magic is missing? When I read the pilot of \"The Sopranos,\" I wasn\\'t terribly blown away by it. I\\'ll be honest with you. Really? Number one, I needed a job at the time. Number two, there really wasn\\'t big shows on cable. Yeah, I thought it was a good character, it was kind of fun, but I wasn\\'t so clear on the tone of the show. I thought it was more of a spoof of the mob. So, if you just read the pilot, you don\\'t really get a sense of how deep he was going to go, David Chase. I knew it was good, but it wasn\\'t something like, \"I have to do this,\" or that I was blown away by it. But then I saw some of the people who were going to do it -- like Edie and Lorraine [Bracco] and Vinnie and Tony. I didn\\'t really know Jim [Gandolfini], I didn\\'t know his work. But, when I saw those actors -- especially Edie, who was always one of my favorites and who I had a lot of respect for for a long time -- I was like, \"okay, that\\'s cool.\" But it wasn\\'t until we started shooting the first season when the other scripts started to come in -- when you saw, \"Oh, wow.\" The scripts kept getting better. So, it wasn\\'t until we started seeing those scripts. You wrote a few episodes. How did that come about? I wrote a spec script after the first season, because I had really fallen in love with the show. Particularly with all of the characters. I wanted to get into the minds of the other characters. So, I wrote a spec script between the first and second season and gave it to David. And during that time, also, \"Summer of Sam\" came out -- I was one of the writers there -- and David saw that. So, between those two things... He\\'s famously tough on his writers. Was he as tough on you, even though you were in the cast? Yeah, he was very tough -- tough on everybody. But, not in a bad way -- in a very good way. And I think the biggest thing I learned from that guy was the detail. Because, as a writer, his attention to detail and specifics was incredible. Nothing was ever generic; nothing was ever taken for granted. If ever a delivery boy shows up at the door with a pizza, it was always like, \"A Pakistani guy with a Brazil soccer jersey who has a limp shows up with a pizza\" -- and the guy has no lines! Everything was like that. Always. I just interviewed Alan Taylor for \"Thor: The Dark World\" about of all the death scenes he\\'s directed... Alan Taylor directed \"Thor\"? \"The Dark World,\" yes. You didn\\'t know that? No. I had no idea. That\\'s pretty cool. But Christopher was his favorite death scene. You know, when I was 17 or 18, I worked on an NYU film and he did the sound on it. And when he came on \"The Sopranos,\" I recognized his face. I was like, \"You went to NYU, did you do this?\" He\\'s like, \"Yeah, I was the sound guy.\" It\\'s so weird. I don\\'t have a question, but I just want to say that I met James Gandolfini randomly at a bar one night and he was nice to me when he didn\\'t have to be and I never forgot that. Yeah, he was that kind of guy. You know, I think the thing with Jim was, my mom called and said, \"everyone is calling me,\" after Jim died. I said, \"Why is everyone calling you?\" She goes, \"Because everyone feels like they knew him.\" When someone like Michael Jackson dies, this huge mega-star that people are mad about, he always seemed like they worshiped him from afar. He was on this pedestal. Whereas with Jim, I think they all felt like he was one of them. And he was a big part of this city. He was just out and about everywhere. Another friend of mine who is an actor who lives in Tribeca said there was a big snowstorm and he looks out his window and he saw Jim shoveling some woman\\'s car out of the snow. And he said, \"I feel kind of safe knowing that Jim Gandolfini lives in the neighborhood.\" And I understood what he means, because you would see him out and about. He\\'s not someone who traveled with bodyguards in limousines. Have you seen \"Enough Said\"? It\\'s very touching. No, I don\\'t know if I\\'m going to see that. It\\'s tough. I mean, I\\'ve seen some clips from it and it seemed like more than anything, that\\'s closer to who he was than anything else I\\'ve seen him in. \\'Sopranos\\' Star Michael Imperioli On \\'Oldboy\\' And The Best Thing About James Gandolfini',\n",

The feature was unlocked after an update yesterday at 6 PM ET/3 PM PT. This is a much awaited feature for the successful vehicle soccer based game, which was promised some time ago. This makes Rocket League the first game to enable cross-platform play between Xbox One and PC. On the other hand, the cross-platform play has already been allowed in Rocket League since its release in PlayStation 4 and PC versions. Jeremy Dunham, Vice President of Psyonix said, \"We’re really excited to bring Xbox One and PC players closer together. Cross-network play has been something that Xbox One gamers have been asking us for since the day we launched, and thanks to Microsoft’s new cross-network policies, we’re proud to give it to them.\" Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that they are interested in allowing Xbox One to support cross network play with Sony’s PlayStation 4. However, Sony didn’t seem too interested in the proposal presented by its counterparts. While speaking to Eurogamer before, Sony Worldwide Studios’ Shuhei Yoshida said, \"Because PC is an open platform it’s much more straightforward. Connecting two different closed networks is much more complicated so we have to work with developers and publishers to understand what it is they are trying to accomplish.\" \"We also have to look at the technical aspect – and the technical aspect could be the easiest. We also have to look at policy issues and business issues as well.\" Well it is quite unlikely that the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One cross-platform play will happen any time soon, but who knows what’s in store for the future.

              "  'context': 'The National Consumers League tested 11 different olive oils purchased at various supermarkets, and found that six of them, despite being labeled \"extra virgin,\" weren\\'t extra virgin at all. This shouldn\\'t come as a surprise, given extensive reports of lax standards and outright fraud in the olive-oil business. In fact, the findings are better than some earlier studies that indicated some olive oils were adulterated with other kinds of oil, such as soybean oil, or were made with olives from countries other than Italy, despite label claims of \"Made in Italy.\" These practices were revealed in a widely shared New York Times interactive feature last year that was based on a couple of different studies. The NCL\\'s testing comes with a load of caveats. It wasn\\'t a \"study\" so much as a more-or-less random bit of testing. Puzzlingly, while the NCL listed the five oils that passed the test, it didn\\'t name the six that didn\\'t. That’s because the companies whose products failed the tests made \"a huge stink\" over the results, said Sally Greenberg, the NCL’s executive director. Those companies complained that only a single bottle of each variety was tested, and so the results were unfair, since occasionally a single bottle will go bad thanks to exposure to light or some other environmental factor. She said the NCL might test the same products again in \"six or seven months,\" using a different lab, and if the results are repeated, the NCL will reveal which products failed. \"If it happens twice, well then maybe we’re on to something,\" she said. In 2011, the University of California at Davis found that about 69% of the olive oil sold in the United States is adulterated. The NCL tested olive oil purchased in supermarkets in the Washington, D.C. area. None of the products they tested contained any oil that didn\\'t come from olives, but six of them, despite labels indicated the contrary, didn\\'t meet the standards for calling it \"extra virgin.\" The testing included lab analysis and tasting by experts. \"The results of our olive oil testing reveal that, while consumers are buying and paying extra for olive oil labeled EVOO, too much of the olive oil bought off the shelf isn’t the real deal,\" said Sally Greenberg, executive director of the NCL, in a statement.

Kaepernick’s decision to sit or take a knee during the national anthem first drew attention after his team’s Aug. 26 preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, when he told NFL.com that he was \"not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.\" Since then, Kaepernick’s continued protest has drawn considerable criticism from politicians, police unions, pundits, other professional athletes and many on social media who have opposed both his message and his method of conveying it. But the problem Kaepernick wants to highlight has continued. And on Monday, it was back in the news again, after police in Tulsa, Oklahoma, released multiple videos that showed the fatal shooting of Terence Crutcher. The videos show that 40-year-old Crutcher, like so many other black men, was unarmed with his hands in the air when police officers shot and killed him as he returned to his car, which had stalled in the middle of a roadway. The videos run contrary to the department’s initial statements about the shooting, which claimed that Crutcher had ignored officers’ warning to raise his hands. Since @Kaepernick7 attempted to raise awareness about police reform in America, police have killed 67 people. In 22 days. #TerenceCrutcher — Black Irish (@Mint_mulatto) September 19, 2016 Overall, police have killed at least 67 people since Kaepernick’s protest began, according to The Guardian’s database. Roughly 22 percent of the victims have been black. Police have killed more than 780 people so far in 2016, according to The Guardian’s numbers. At least 193 of those people ― or about 25 percent ― were black. Of the 15 black people killed since Kaepernick’s demonstration started, at least 11 were shot, according to The Washington Post’s tracker of fatal police shootings. The white officer who shot Crutcher, Betty Shelby, was placed on paid administrative leave while the department investigates the case ― another issue Kaepernick highlighted when he spoke out against police killings. \"To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,\" Kaepernick said. \"There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\" ASSOCIATED PRESS Terence Crutcher, 40, is one of at least 15 African-Americans to die during encounters with police since Kaepernick began protesting before NFL games in late August. Kaepernick’s message has spread across the sports world since the start of the NFL season. Players on a number of NFL teams ― including the Miami Dolphins, Denver Broncos and Tennessee Titans ― joined his demonstration during the first week of the NFL season. The Denver Broncos’ Brandon Marshall, who has taken a knee during the anthem, responded to the Terence Crutcher video by saying such situations are the \"exact reason we’re protesting.\" Some of the protests have drawn the ire of police. In Miami, the union that represents the Broward County Sheriff’s Office called on the department to stop providing security details for Dolphins’ games after four members of the team knelt during the anthem last week. \"In certain professions,\" the head of the union said, \"an individual’s freedom of speech must take a back seat to the organization or government entity that they choose to represent.\" The NFL Players Association, which has stood behind Kaepernick’s right to protest, fired back at that statement Monday. \"Don’t we stop being the land of the free and the home of the brave when a citizen is asked to take a ‘backseat’ for expressing his freedom by those sworn to defend it?\" DeMaurice Smith, the NFLPA’s executive director, said in a statement. \"Players don’t stop being men and citizens just because they are wearing a jersey.\" And while many have questioned how a black athlete could qualify as oppressed, recent cases highlight that Kaepernick and other black athletes are also at risk of experiencing police violence.

However, people were doubtful of her claims when she failed to produce a photo of the two of them for proof. Some even thought that Andrea was simply seeking attention. \"Ang galing ko,\" Andrea joked when she remembered about not having a photo together with Diesel. Eventually, speculations regarding the truth behind her statements were silenced when Ricky Lo managed to confirm the situation with Vin Diesel. Diesel confessed of having met Andrea in LA during an interview with Ricky Lo. When asked whether Diesel had courted her then, the former member of ‘Viva Hot Babes’ refused to give a clear answer and laughed it off instead. In a previous interview with PEP.ph (Philippine Entertainment Portal), Andrea narrated that Diesel walked up to her and Bayle while they were in a bar – at this point, she remained unaware of the identity of the actor. A few moments later, Diesel invited them over to his place as he was hosting a house party. It was only when they have arrived at his home that the face and name clicked into place in Andrea’s mind. The pair saw each other twice before the Filipina had to fly back home. With the rumors circulating that her ‘miracle baby’ Beatrice Anne was an offspring of Diesel, Andrea quickly dismissed it and shared how she single-handedly raised her daughter. The child had to undergo several surgeries before, and Andrea confessed that it was no feat especially since she was away from the support of her loved ones. Thankfully, Andrea’s continuous prayers have been fruitful as Beatrice is now a healthy six-year old. At present, Andrea’s life is far from what was once filled with controversy – she is now busy being a hands-on mother, business owner, and a politician.

Comic book fans, even those who panned the theatrical release of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice have been pining for the release of the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition. Now that it’s available to own on Blu-Ray and on Amazon Video, things have changed. As almost any critic will tell you, the version of the film shown in theaters was deeply flawed for a number of reasons. Chief among those reasons, though, was the fact that the entire film felt rushed and like there were necessary plot points that were essentially glazed over or skipped entirely. With the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition having 30 more minutes of footage and even a shiny R-rating, some of those major issues with the theatrical version have been fixed. Suffice it to say that the the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition is the far superior version of Zack Snyder’s film. However, one thing that readers have noticed is that the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition isn’t yet available to rent on Amazon Video. This obviously begs the simple question of when this better version of the movie will in fact be available to rent. The short answer is that we don’t know, but we do know that this isn’t uncommon with bigger releases. Amazon Video did the same thing with Star Wars: The Force Awakens and many others when they were released, but they eventually became available to rent on Amazon Video after a few weeks.

The composer handled score duties for the studio on this summer\\'s \"Iron Man 3\" and also replaced Carter Burwell as music maestro on \"Thor: The Dark World.\" \"We\\'d just had a spectacular experience with Brian Tyler on \\'Iron Man 3,\\' and he enthusiastically stepped into this, and delivered what I think is the best score we\\'ve had in a Marvel movie,\" Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige told The Playlist about Tyler\\'s \"Thor 2\" contributions. What goes into making a score for the world\\'s biggest franchise machine? HuffPost Entertainment asked Tyler during a recent phone chat. 1. Pay attention to the story The score for \"Thor: The Dark World\" sounds nothing like what composer Patrick Doyle did on \"Thor,\" and there\\'s a reason for that. \"In this film, he is fully realized,\" Tyler said, noting that the God of Thunder had gone through an entire \"Thor\" movie as well as \"Marvel\\'s The Avengers\" before landing on \"The Dark World.\" \"We needed a mature character theme, where he\\'s regal, he\\'s epic, and the romance with Jane [played by Natalie Portman] is kind of melancholy, because she\\'s this mortal that he\\'s fallen for, which could not be further from his side of the train tracks.\" 2. Take advantage of your setting Unlike \"Thor,\" which put the title character on Earth for much of its length, \"Thor: The Dark World\" keeps the major focus on Asgard, his home planet. \"There\\'s spaceships and lasers. So you have that element of the \\'Star Wars\\' influence, which we all grew up with,\" Tyler said. \"It\\'s science-fiction, but within it they wear capes and fight with swords and ride horses. There\\'s almost a \\'Lord of the Rings\\' feeling as well. The music had to reflect these things. Those were not elements really present as much in the first one. So it required something different. I think my score for \\'Thor: The Dark World\\' would have been out of place in the first film and vice versa.\" 3. Listen to Marvel \"Marvel wants themes that are recognizable and that kind of, more or less, give a branding, personality and a musical thematic hook [to these characters] that you can hang your hat on, post-\\'Avengers,\\'\" Tyler said. Not that collaborating with Marvel is a chore. \"I love working with them. Kevin Feige is someone I feel simpatico with,\" Tyler said. \"I just really feel he always has the best interests of the film at heart. We\\'re just trying to make films that we would love to watch ourselves. I was a fan long before working with them. A lot of the people at Marvel now were just like me: kids who grew up collecting Marvel comics.\" 4. Give the audience nostalgia If the theme from \"Thor: The Dark World\" sounds familiar, that\\'s intentional. \"Something that I find is the hardest thing about composing, but also the most rewarding, is writing something that instantaneously has nostalgia,\" Tyler said. \"You want it to fit so well that the audience thinks it always had to be that way.\" 5. Have friends like John Williams Tyler, who grew up listening to John Williams\\' \"Star Wars\" score, has become close with the famed composer during the last several years. \"His mantra is that it\\'s all about the music. \\'It\\'s all about the music, Brian.\\' It\\'s true!\" Tyler said about the advice he\\'s taken from Williams. \"There\\'s so much other stuff that goes on -- box office and politics and awards season -- but at the end of the day, it doesn\\'t matter. You should just do what you think you should do, and you\\'re always going to have people who throw stones -- there are going to be people who don\\'t like what you do -- but there will be people who also enjoy what you do.

              "  'context': 'It was discovered in 1892 and ignored for almost a century. But by studying the many fossils of this enigmatic reptile, Tyler Lyson from the Denver Museum of Nature and Science has devised a fascinating new idea about turtle origins . He thinks that their iconic shells evolved not for defense, but for digging. They anchored the powerful arm strokes needed to shift soil and sand. Before turtles became impregnable walking fortresses, they were professional burrowers. Travel back in time to 260 million years ago, just before the dawn of the dinosaur era. Journey to what is now South Africa, and make your way to a river bank. Then, wait. If you’re lucky, you might see a small, hand-sized creature poking its head out of the mud. It looks like a fat lizard, with bulging flanks and stocky legs. But if you managed to grab it and flip it over, you’d find that its flanks are bulging because its ribs are exceptionally wide, broad, and flat, reinforcing its undersides. It’s almost like the little creature has half a shell. First, the lower ribs became wider and fused with each other to give half a shell—the plastron. Then, the upper ribs followed suit and merged with the spine, creating the carapace. (This means that, contrary to cartoons, you can’t pull a turtle out of its shell.) Eventually, through an intricate bit of evolutionary origami , the ribs started growing over the shoulder blades, rather than sitting below them as in you, me, and most other land-living vertebrates. Once paleontologists knew what one intermediate turtle might look like, they found new ones like Pappochelys . They also added existing fossils like Eunotosaurus to the family; ironically, it had been previously ruled out as an early turtle because it lacked osteoderms. With these fossils, scientists could reconstruct the evolution of the shell. Everything changed in 2008, when Chinese researchers discovered a 220-million-year-old turtle with a shell that covered just its belly and not its back. They called it Odontochelys semitestacea —literally, the \"toothed turtle in a half-shell.\" It was as beautiful an intermediate fossil as they could have hoped for. And strikingly, it had no osteoderms at all. It did, however, have very broad ribs. The developmental biologists were right! It didn’t help that for the longest time, the oldest known turtle was a creature called Proganochelys , which already had a fully developed (and very spiky) shell, meaning it couldn’t tell us anything about how that structure first arose. For almost a century, biologists argued about how turtles got their shells—a debate almost as slow and plodding as the creatures themselves. Paleontologists mostly argued that the shells evolved from bony scales called osteoderms, which are also responsible for the armor of crocodiles, armadillos, and many dinosaurs. These scales simply expanded to fuse with the ribs and backbone, creating a solid covering. But developmental biologists disagreed. By studying modern turtle embryos, they deduced that the shell evolved from ribs, which broadened out and eventually united. That takes care of how the shell evolved. \"For me, the next question was: Why?\" says Lyson. \"And there are two huge reasons why not.\" First, the ribs and their associated muscles help to inflate and deflate the lungs. If you broaden and fuse your ribs, you compromise your ability to breathe. Second, if you’re a reptile, you also become slower. Reptiles have a sprawling gait, so they bend their bodies sideways to increase the length of their stride. They effectively walk with their entire trunks, which you can see in this video of a walking Komodo dragon . But wide fused ribs prevent trunks from bending, so turtles are powered only by their limbs. That’s partly why they’re famously slow. What benefit could a shell possibly provide that compensates for being worse at both breathing and walking? \"When I went to these turtle-specific conferences and I talked to people, they automatically said it was for protection,\" Lyson recalls. \"But that never made any sense.\" Modern turtle shells certainly make for potent defenses, but the wide ribs of Eunotosaurus and Pappochelys do not. They wouldn’t even have covered the creatures’ heads, necks, or backs. If protection was important, it would have made far more sense to follow crocodiles and armadillos down the osteoderm route, which wouldn’t have hampered breathing or walking. So, to explain why the turtle shell evolved, you need to explain why they first started widening their ribs, despite the substantial costs of doing so. Lyson came up with a fresh answer by studying a large number of Eunotosaurus fossils. One specimen, which had been recently discovered by an eight-year-old South African boy, was especially important because it preserved the animal’s entire body, including its hands and feet. Lyson noticed that Eunotosaurus had many distinctive features. It had a short, spade-shaped skull. Its hands were larger and sturdier than its feet. Its shoulder blades and forearms had large attachment points for especially buff triceps, all the better for pulling its arms back with extreme force. In short, it was built like a digger. Now the ribs made sense: they would have anchored the front legs as they scooped away at earth. They were excavation innovations. He compares the turtle shell to bird feathers—complex structures that didn’t evolve for their current function. Those same traits would also have made for a powerful swimmer, but Lyson found that Eunotosaurus has two features that digging requires but swimming does not: big claws for breaking up soil, and thickened bones for withstanding compressive forces. Indeed, when Lyson looked at its legs in cross-section, he found that the front pair was loaded with super thick bone, but the hind pair were not. Again, all the signs pointed to a burrowing specialist. Eunotosaurus was often found near ponds and river banks, but lived at a time when South Africa was dry. Perhaps it burrowed to escape droughts, leaving the unpredictable environment on the surface for a more stable one beneath it. Its eyes support this idea. Another newly discovered specimen of Eunotosaurus has preserved sclerotic rings—bony circles that surround its eyes. By measuring these, Lyson deduced that the animal had small eyes that were likely insensitive to light. He interprets this as evidence of a life spent mostly underground.

              "  'context': 'Republican politicians have been focused on voter fraud as a hot-button issue for most of the last decade. Despite repeated claims of rampant illegal voting, election and law enforcement officials have found no evidence that its a widespread problem.  The data (or lack thereof) makes it all the more noteworthy when a case of voter fraud is discovered. A story emerged late this week about a Texas woman who was sentenced to eight years in prison, thanks to some confusion on her part on whether she was allowed to vote or not. Rosa Maria Ortega, 37, is a permanent resident of the United States who the New York Times reports was brought to America as an infant. The Times relayed a piece of her family history, and shared how she first gained the ability to vote:  Ms. Ortega, a native of Monterrey, Mexico, came to Texas with her mother when she was an infant. More than a decade later, the family was scattered after the mother was arrested and deported. Two brothers born in Dallas automatically gained citizenship; Ms. Ortega became a permanent resident and gained a green card, her brother Tony Ortega, 35, said in an interview. As a Dallas County resident, she registered to vote and later cast ballots in elections in 2012 and 2014, her lawyer, [Clark] Birdsall, said. While that was illegal, there was no attempt to break the law, he maintained: Some government forms allow applicants to declare that they are permanent residents, but the voting registration form asks only whether an applicant is a citizen. Lacking the permanent resident option, he said, she ticked the \\'citizen\\' box. When the county later mailed her a registration card, he said, she believed she \\'was good to go.\\' The issue for Ortega was simple: people with \"permanent resident\" status are not permitted to vote in national, state, or local elections that require citizenship to cast a ballot. Exceptions to this rule in a modern setting are rare, and provisions to allow non-citizen voters to participate in local elections have often been met with dramatic pushback. Unaware of this distinction, it was Ortega\\'s next move that raised alarm and sealed her fate: Ms. Ortega moved to neighboring Tarrant County and again registered, but this time checked a box affirming that she was not a citizen. When her application was rejected in March 2015, the trial showed, she called election officials and told them that she had previously voted in Dallas County without difficulty. Told that she could not vote unless she was a citizen, she asked for another application, and returned it with a check in the box affirming citizenship. That raised questions, and law enforcement officials arrested her on fraud charges. Ortega was close to escaping serious punishment for the offense, and her attorney supposedly set up a plea deal with Texas\\' attorney general, Ken Paxton. County DA Sharen Wilson axed the deal, and publicly signaled her intent to crack down on voter fraud. \"In all aspects of society, people verify their identity,\" Wilson said. \"Why not for voting? This case shows a clear need to enforce the laws we already have.\" Prior to her conviction, Ortega was a registered Republican. She voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, and in 2014 she voted for Paxton -- the man whose office would eventually prosecute her -- in his successful bid for Texas AG.  The eight-year sentence and eventual deportation will have far-reaching effects on Ortega\\'s family. Her four children, all between the ages of 13 and 16, are currently being supervised by other family members and Ortega\\'s fiancee, the latter of whom has no legal custody of the children.  President Donald Trump has doubled down on his party\\'s insistence that voter fraud is an issue. He has publicly called for a \"major\" investigation of the 2016 election, echoing widely-discredited claims that three-to-five million illegal votes were cast last November.

              "  'context': 'Words have the power to inform, embolden, and inspire. But very few have the power to send a cold shiver up your spine quite like the word \"moist.\" Thanks to a new piece of research, scientists might have uncovered what makes this word so uncomfortable to hear. First of all, you’re not alone if you find the word aversive. The study, recently published online in PLOS One , found that around 18 percent of people have a \"categorical aversion\" to the word \"moist.\" Paul Thibodeau, a cognitive psychologist from Oberlin College, considered three different hypotheses for why the word makes so many people’s skin crawl. These possible explanations were the sound of the word, the word\\'s connotation, and the social transmission of the idea that the word is disgusting. Within a series of five experiments, Thibodeau investigated American English-speaking participants\\' opinion of the word \"moist,\" among other words. These included words related to bodily function (such as phlegm, puke, and vomit), clusters of words related to sex (such as f*ck, horny, and p*ssy), and words that sounded similar to \"moist\" (such as foist, hoist, and rejoiced). His study found that people who said they were averse to the word \"moist\" often pointed to the sound of the word as the source of their disgust. People who weren’t averse to the word said it was its connotations to sex. However, people who didn\\'t like the word had no problem with similar-sounding words. The study found that people who identified as categorically averse to \"moist\" also found words such as \"phlegm\" and \"vomit\" more aversive, although not words such as \"vagina,\" \"horny,\" or \"penis.\" This suggests that the word\\'s association with bodily fluid is a strong reason for why it is so gross to so many people. The researchers also found a social element to people\\'s aversion to the word \"moist.\" They showed one group of participants a hilarious video by People Magazine (below) that had \"the sexiest men alive\" saying the word \"moist\" in an purposely cringe-inducing and awkward context. Another group watched a \"control\" video that showed people saying \"moist\" to describe the taste of cake. People who watched the video with the word being said in a socially cringe-worthy context later expressed more disgust for the word. This suggests that our perception of the word is strongly tied to how those around us also perceive it. Due to these findings, the study concluded that our uncomfortable reaction to the word stems from our natural disgust of bodily functions. Importantly, this is strongly reinforced by social cues. While understanding this horrifically awkward word is important, there is a greater point to the study. As Thibodeau explains , the study hopes to understand how we process emotional words, as opposed to neutral words, and how this is affected by our external environment. \"Disgust is adaptive. If we didn’t have an instinct to run away from vomit and diarrhea, disease would spread more easily,\" writes Thibodeau. \"But is this instinct biological or do we learn it? Does our culture shape what we find disgusting? This is a complex and nuanced question. Significant work is needed to answer it definitively. But the present studies suggest that, when it comes to the disgust that is elicited by words like \\'moist,\\' there is an important cultural component – the symbols we use to communicate with one another can become contaminated and elicit disgust by virtue of their association with bodily functions.\" Why You Hate The Word \"Moist\", According To Science',\n",

Instead, the next exciting iPhone will come out in 2017, and it could have several new features, like wireless charging, an edge-to-edge screen, and better camera all wrapped up in a glass body. Catcher Technology makes some of the aluminum shells for the iPhone 6. So its CEO, Allen Horng, might have inside information on Apple\\'s chassis plans. And on Thursday, he said: \"As far as I know, only one [iPhone] model will adopt glass casing next year,\" after Catcher\\'s annual shareholder meeting, Nikkei reports. He continued: \"I don\\'t think this move will have an impact on Catcher\\'s revenue, as glass casing still needs a durable metal frame, which requires advanced processing technology and would not be cheaper than the current model.\" As Nikkei points out, one-third of Catcher\\'s revenue comes from Apple, so it\\'s a critical customer for the company. Before the iPhone 6 came out, with its Catcher-supplied case, company revenues ballooned.

              "  'context': 'California has both the most ultra-wealthy individuals and the highest poverty rate of any U.S. state, according to recent reports. \"This chasm is growing day by day, year by year,\" Larry Gerston, professor of political science at San Jose State University, said to The Huffington Post. \"Those at the top in California are just as happy as a clam. Their incomes are going up much faster than anyone else\\'s.\" In 2013, the Golden-for-some State was home to the most -- 12,560 -- ultra-wealthy individuals, according to a new report by Wealth-X, a think tank focusing on wealthy people. New York had the second most, with 8,945 ultra-wealthy individuals. Wealth-X defines ultra-wealthy as having a net worth of at least $30 million. California gained even more ultra-wealthy individuals in 2013 than any other state, adding an additional 1,605 residents. Florida gained the second most, an additional 565 more than in 2012. But California also has the highest poverty rate in the nation, according to an analysis released Wednesday by the U.S. Census Bureau. Nearly one in four Californians -- about 24 percent of the overall population -- lives in poverty. Behind California, the District of Columbia and Nevada have the second and third highest poverty rates, according to the analysis. Across the U.S., about 16 percent of Americans live in poverty. The census analysis considered income, government benefits, taxes and cost of living. The official poverty threshold for a two-adult-two-child family was $23,283 in 2012. What to do about these grim statistics? For one, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in September the highest minimum wage in the nation, to be rolled out over the next three years. California\\'s minimum wage will bump from $8 to $9 an hour in July 2014, and then up to $10 an hour in January 2016. Brown also fought tooth and nail last year to get voters to pass Proposition 30, which raises income taxes on the wealthiest Californians to help fund K-12 schools, community colleges and state universities. The measure is desperately needed, as California\\'s education system ranks 36th in the nation, with a C grade, in Quality Count\\'s 2013 report. California educates about one-eighth of the nation\\'s students. But Prop 30 is just a temporary fix -- a \"band-aid,\" Gerston said. California\\'s education system desperately needs more funds, and the state\\'s poor need more social services. And getting initiatives passed that address these issues may prove to be an uphill battle, as Gerston pointed out. Part of the problem is that those at the bottom don\\'t vote nearly as much as those at the top, Gerston said. In California, this is exacerbated because recent immigrants are even less likely to vote. But Gerston is optimistic that democracy will catch up with immigration. As more immigrants have been here for second and third generations, percentages of Latinos and Asian American voters have crept up, he said. \"You will see the legislature filled with more and more people reflecting the state\\'s demographics,\" he said. \"The voting turnout will eventually be a majority of non-whites.\" And those non-whites and low-income Californians will vote in their own interest, as voters always do, Gerston said. \"Give this another 20 years, and you\\'re going to see a state that\\'s markedly different.\" The State With The Most Rich People Also Has The Highest Poverty Rate',\n",

              "  'context': 'Earlier this week, the Internet found out there\\'s a market for prehistoric heavy petting. But who\\'s behind dinosaur erotica and its titillating tales of veloci-rapture? HuffPost Weird spoke with Alara Branwen, co-author of works such as Taken by the T-Rex, Ravished by the Triceratops and In the Velociraptor\\'s Nest. Branwen said she and co-author Christie Sims, both in their early 20s, write under pseudonyms and won\\'t be revealing their true identities anytime soon. \"Do you really think we are crazy enough to publish what we publish under our own names?\" she asked. Even so, we got the down and dirty about dinosaur-human lovin\\' and the fans who read about it: HuffPost Weird News: How did you and Christie meet? Branwen: We were assigned to the same dorm room two years ago, and since then we have been best friends. How did you get started writing erotica? I was working a crappy supermarket job that didn’t even make me enough money to pay my bills from college. I was complaining to my coworker about my lack of money when he told me about how people were self-publishing fiction online. This friend who had actually read my writing before, told me I might be pretty good at writing erotica. So I thought, \"Hey, maybe I can do that.\" I did my research, and wrote my first story, which was a story involving a dragon having sex with a human girl titled, \"Doing the Dragon.\" Within a month I was making more [money] writing erotica than I was at my crummy job. So I quit my job and started writing erotica full-time. I also scaled back from full-time to part-time at my college. Christie saw how much money I was making with erotica and she wanted to join in. That long and winding road has led us to become the dynamic duo of beast sex! You often hear that \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is targeted at middle-aged women. Who is the target demographic for dinosaur erotica? You know, we are not really sure. When we first started writing it, we thought we were writing it for women. Since we have published it however, we have had a lot of fan mail from both men and women of all ages. We have a few more men than women, I would say the percentage would be about 60% men /40% women. All of the readers, that we know of, seem to be between the ages of 21 and 65. Why are people aroused by dino-boning? I think it’s because dinosaur erotica appeals to our more base, carnal natures. Some people also probably like the idea of a big, powerful, massive male roughly having sex with a smaller female. It’s like the ultimate sexual experience with an alpha male, which is something that we are all inherently wired to enjoy. At least, I think so anyway. Your Amazon bio notes that you write \"from personal experience.\" Care to elaborate? I have loads and loads of nasty sex with T-rexes and raptors. You have no idea how long it takes to clean up the messes... OK, maybe that isn’t entirely true. But actually I was raised in a fairly open-minded household and I learned about sex at a young age. Christie was the same way. Also, Christie and I are both into some of what would be considered \"kinky\" things (not together). I am into some light BDSM and a few other fetishes that I won’t go into deep detail with. Christie is into some of the heavier dungeon bondage stuff as well as some \"toy play.\" But my fantasies in the bedroom have helped fuel my writer’s imagination. Are the short arms of a T-rex a problem in the bedroom? Sadly yes, the shorter arms make it hard for the creature to balance himself. That limits the positions that he can take part in. Any part of the kama sutra that requires holding your partner are out of the question. That’s usually fine though, the power in his hind legs more than make up for his lack of upper-body support. Short arms are also why male T-rexes are the most voracious in looking for mates. They can’t \"relieve themselves\" by themselves, so they have to have someone \"help them,\" if you know what I mean. Which dino is the best cuddler? A brontosaurus, of course. Those great big longnecks are just big snuggly bears! Do dinos use protection? With each other they do. However, when it comes to interspecies relations, nah. They can’t catch any puny, non-dino social diseases, and since they are a different species than who they are sleeping with, they can’t get their partners pregnant (or vice-versa). All of your stories appear to be about female humans and male dinosaurs. Do you have any plans to write the reverse? What about same-sex pairings? Christie and I have very seriously thought about doing something along those lines, especially same sex pairings. We have mainly done male creature/female human because that was where the market was. However, if we try it and it does well, we will most definitely do same-sex pairings and male human/female creature stories. What\\'s in the future for you and Christie? What comes after dinosaur erotica? Well we are planning to do a few more dinosaur erotica stories in the near future. But after that we plan to go back to doing more fantasy creature erotica. After we reach a certain number of short stories/novels, Christie and I both plan to retire from the monster porn business. Once that day comes I plan to take up writing for games again, and perhaps write science fiction, fantasy, and romance stories. Christie plans to write a series of urban fantasy novels. Where can we see more of your writing? You can see more of our writing on our Amazon author page. I am also going to start putting snippets of new stories up on my blog.

              "  'context': 'By Emily Gurnon Health & Caregiving Editor By Emily Gurnon June 17, 2016 Credit: kriskristofferson.com Kris Kristofferson For years, songwriter and actor Kris Kristofferson was told he was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease or some other type of dementia. His memory was getting progressively worse. But Kristofferson, 79, has revealed that he was misdiagnosed — he actually has Lyme disease, according to a June 6 story in Rolling Stone . A positive test result confirmed the hunch earlier this year, the magazine said. \"He was taking all these medications for things he doesn’t have, and they all have side effects,\" his wife, Lisa, told Rolling Stone. After three weeks of Lyme treatment, there are still some down days, but on other days he seems normal, she said. \"All of a sudden he was back.\" Lasting Effects Possible Lyme disease is caused by an infected blacklegged tick, also known as a deer tick. If left untreated, it can eventually cause a host of debilitating symptoms, including severe headaches, one or more rashes, stiff neck, severe joint pain and swelling, heart palpitations, facial paralysis, dizziness, nerve pain and memory loss, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Many of these patients say that medical officials pay little attention to their persisting symptoms. — Michael Specter, The New Yorker Other cognitive problems that can occur after months or even years include, according to the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center of Columbia University Medical Center: problems remembering names or words slowed thinking \"brain fog\" difficulty following conversations. \"My brain is so destroyed. To me it’s amazing I can still get up and go to the show,\" Kristofferson told the Las Vegas Review-Journal last fall. \"But I can remember all the songs.\" The tiny arachnids are found in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, north-central and Pacific Coast areas of the United States, the CDC says. The disease may reveal itself within 30 days in a characteristic \"bull’s-eye\" rash, but some people never get a rash. And since most bites come from the immature form of the tick, which is about the size of a poppy seed, the incursion can easily go unnoticed. About 300,000 people are diagnosed with Lyme disease each year, according to the CDC, and the government has recognized it as a \"major health threat.\" Ongoing Controversy The medical establishment has been at odds for years, however, with critics who believe that Lyme is vastly under-diagnosed and under-treated. There is fierce disagreement about how reliable testing methods are and even what to call a lasting illness. \"The term ‘chronic Lyme disease’ (CLD) has been used to describe people with different illnesses,\" the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases says on its website. \"While the term is sometimes used to describe illness in patients with Lyme disease, in many occasions it has been used to describe symptoms in people who have no evidence of a current or past infection with [the Lyme bacterium]. \"Because of the confusion in how the term CLD is employed, experts in this field do not support its use,\" the agency says. That angers those who say conventional doctors ignored their complaints. \"Many of these patients say that medical officials pay little attention to their persisting symptoms, and that Lyme disease is anything but easy to treat or to cure,\" wrote Michael Specter in a 2013 article in The New Yorker magazine. Complicating the matter is the fact that the same ticks that carry Lyme disease may pass along other harmful bacteria, as well. (Cases of babesiosis , for example, have been found in people also infected with Lyme.) Early Signs and Symptoms These are usually seen between three and 30 days after a tick bite, the CDC says: Fever and chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, swollen lymph nodes Rash known as erythema migrans (EM) Later Signs and Symptoms These may be experienced weeks or months after the bite, the CDC says: Severe headaches Neck stiffness Additional rashes on other parts of the body Arthritis with severe joint pain and swelling, often in the knees Facial or Bell’s palsy Muscle and joint pain that comes and goes Heart palpitations or an irregular heartbeat (Lyme carditis) Dizziness or shortness of breath Nerve pain Shooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet Problems with short-term memory Prevention Is Key To keep from getting infected by ticks, take the following precautions: Avoid wooded areas with a lot of brush, high grass and leaf litter; stick to the center of trails; use bug repellent with DEET (20 to 30 percent) on exposed skin and clothes; use repellants with 0.5 percent permethrin on clothing (some clothing comes pre-treated). Remember that pets can bring ticks inside, so make sure they are protected, too. Ask your veterinarian for advice. And carefully inspect yourself for ticks after hiking, camping or being in the backyard if it’s close to a wooded area. Kris Kristofferson\\'s \\'Dementia\\' Was Actually Lyme Disease',\n",

Abilify, Abilify Maintena, Aristada and some generics all contain aripiprazole. The FDA says the impulse-control problems are rare, but can be serious. Those impulses could include the type of uncontrollable urges that could harm both the person suffering from the side effects and the people near them. \"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning that compulsive or uncontrollable urges to gamble, binge eat, shop, and have sex have been reported with the use of the antipsychotic drug aripiprazole (Abilify, Abilify Maintena, Aristada, and generics). These uncontrollable urges were reported to have stopped when the medicine was discontinued or the dose was reduced. These impulse-control problems are rare, but they may result in harm to the patient and others if not recognized.\" The effects go away after patients stop taking or reduce the dosage of a prescription with aripiprazole, but The FDA warns that patients should talk to their doctor before they stop using the drug. ATTN: received this statement from Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc., the makers of Abilify. \"Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc. agrees with and supports the U.S. FDA’s decision to include a warning for a rare risk of impulse-control problems in the label for aripiprazole, such as pathological gambling, compulsive eating, shopping, and sexual behaviors. Pathological gambling was already part of the US Package Insert as a Post-Marketing Adverse Reaction. The decision to treat with aripiprazole should be made after a thorough diagnostic evaluation and a discussion between a patient and their physician of both the benefits and risks of treatment with aripiprazole.\" ATTN: also reached out to the makers of Aristada.

              "  'context': ': and how to make it at home. The New York Daily News reports Chef Michele Weber, of Manhattan’s Upper West Side restaurant Good Enough to Eat, plows through four cases of it a week, making \"Crack Dip\" and her special scrambled eggs. Chef Ron Eyester, from Rosebud in Atlanta: \"I use it in my restaurant mac and cheese – it’s so creamy – but we don’t say that on the menu description.\" – Every Day with Rachael Ray. And last winter, when there was a shortage of this key ingredient just before the Super Bowl, the Today Show urged consumers not to resort to hoarding – their favorite queso dip could be made with substitutes. Given the photo at the top of this post, you’ve probably guessed by now what I’m talking about: Velveeta cheese. A childhood friend for many, Velveeta has followed us right on into adulthood. Some claim it still makes the best mac and cheese ever, due to its supreme \"meltability.\" Others swear by it for superior grilled cheese sandwiches. I haven’t purchased Velveeta in years, truth be told. But when I saw this recipe for DIY Velveeta on one or our favorite blogs, Brown Eyed Baker, I simply had to give it a try. And darned if these four simple ingredients (shredded cheese, a packet of unflavored gelatin, dry milk, and water) didn’t make a block of smooth orange \"Velveeta.\" In like 3 minutes flat. So OK, you’re not a Velveeta fan. But make this soft-yet-firm, creamy \"cheese mixture\" and I swear you’ll find as many uses for it as there are old-timey dips, sauces, sandwiches, and casseroles out there using Velveeta – which is plenty. First, line a suitable container with plastic wrap. I used our 9′′ x 4′′ x 4′′ loaf pan, but go ahead and use whatever shape of pan you like. Note: I later discovered this recipe fits perfectly into two plastic wrap-lined 3 1/4′′ x 5 3/4′′ mini loaf pans, the typical foil pans you find at the supermarket. Mini pans yield a more Velveeta-like shape. The preparation couldn’t be simpler. Put 6 tablespoons dry milk (I used our Baker’s Special Dry Milk, which is nonfat) and a 1/4-ounce packet dry unflavored gelatin in a blender or food processor. Blend briefly, just to combine. Add 1 cup boiling water, blending just until smooth. IMMEDIATELY add 16 ounces shredded cheese. I used a couple of 8-ounce bags of shredded orange sharp cheddar cheese. Brown Eyed Baker says to use a mild, freshly grated cheese, but this seemed to work just fine. Process until the mixture is totally smooth. Go ahead, dip your finger in to taste – that’s the best way to tell. Pour/scoop the mixture into your prepared pan. It starts setting up pretty quickly, so don’t dawdle. Gently pat the plastic wrap onto the surface; the less wrinkled the wrap, the smoother your final product. Refrigerate for a few hours, until it’s set. Take it out of the pan, and make sure it’s wrapped securely – no bare surfaces showing. Refrigerate until you’re ready for a grilled cheese. Or mac and cheese. Or everyone’s Famous Queso Dip – which is made with just two ingredients: this cheese, and a can of Ro*Tel Diced Tomatoes and Green Chilies (one 10-ounce can added to a pound of cheese). The recipe, which originally comes from Chef Michael Symon (you know, the guy on Iron Chef), says it’s good for a month in the fridge. I can neither confirm nor deny that – I used mine up at a party within a week of making it. Yup, I admit it – I went all the way and made Famous Queso Dip. And trust me, it’s making another appearance on Super Bowl Sunday. I’ll be feeding the same audience – and even the non-cooks in this crowd can figure out how to buy a bag of Fritos!

              " {'human_spoiler': 'Wearing makeup',\n",
              "  'context': 'We know we shouldn\\'t go straight to spin class or run laps at the neighborhood track while wearing a full face of makeup, but we barely have enough time to change into workout gear once we finish at the office. (It\\'s all about prioritization!) Plus, we\\'re going to wash everything off -- from the makeup to the sweat -- later anyway, right? But we also know that our baby-faced days are numbered. So we asked Dr. Ava Shamban, Beverly Hills-based dermatologist and author of \"Heal Your Skin,\" and Mally Steves Chakola, founder of M. Steves skincare, just how bad it is to wear makeup while exercising. Can we get a pass with waterproof-mascara? Here are the workout beauty facts you should know and put into practice: Heavy foundations, powders or concealers could contribute to clogged pores. Lighter makeup formulas will also slide right off once you break a sweat, according to Shamban. (Not a cute look when you\\'re on the treadmill next to a hot guy.) \"Eye makeup -- especially mascara, even if it\\'s waterproof -- is a bad idea because it can run and get into your eyes,\" she says. \"And blush is totally unnecessary because your workout will flush your face on its own.\" \"Since your pores open up while sweating, you don’t want to block your skin\\'s ability to breathe by wearing heavy makeup,\" Chakola adds. \"I personally find that mica and micronized formulas can be small enough to enter open pores and can lead to irritation or breakouts.\" It\\'s ideal to remove makeup before beginning a workout by using a cleanser that won’t irritate your skin. Regardless of the form of cleanser, choose a cleanser that is sulfate-free, which won\\'t dry out your skin from frequent washing and is free of synthetic fragrances so you\\'ll avoid skin inflammation. But breaking into a sweat can make it easier to rid the skin of pore-clogging substances. \"What heat and perspiration can do is warm the skin, making the dislodging of pore-clogging substances easier during exfoliation with a cleanser, scrub, washcloth or device like the Clarisonic in the shower after your workout,\" Shamban says. \"It\\'s the same principal that aestheticians use when steaming the skin at the beginning of a facial.\" Don\\'t be afraid to wipe your face with your T-shirt while exercising. It won\\'t hurt your skin. The function of sweat is primarily to cool the body rather than excretion, Shamban explains. The excretion exception is that some medicines and the metabolic aftermath of sulfur-intense foods like garlic get exuded from the pores. \"Perspiration from the eccrine sweat glands is basically just water and is pretty clean. On the other hand, perspiration from apocrine sweat glands in the groin, under the arms and on the feet contains bacteria, which is why it smells,\" she says. \"While we don\\'t like the odor (unless it\\'s from someone we\\'re attracted to sexually), in and of itself, sweat is not bad for the skin. Keeping ourselves odor-free is more a social nicety than a real health issue.\" People often confuse the slick feeling of perspiration with the slick feeling of oily skin. But Shamban assures us that they\\'re not the same thing. \"Working out will make you sweat but it doesn\\'t accelerate oil (sebum) production, which is influenced by genetics and hormones. Workouts don\\'t contribute to breakouts unless it\\'s acne mechanica where there is non-stop rubbing from straps, clothing or equipment.\" In this case, try to avoid touching your face, particularly if you have active breakouts. Use a spot treatment after washing your face with a cleanser containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Just think twice before using the towels and shower gel at the gym. Unfortunately, the laundering at most gyms is not regulated like in hospitals. \"The gym towels may look clean, but they are often washed in fragrant detergents and fabric softeners,\" Chakola says. \"While these may make the towel smell clean and look bright, bacteria can live in the fibers of the cloth if the towel isn\\'t replaced frequently or cleaned properly.\" Even if you bring your own towels, the gym environment can transfer bacteria onto your skin, whether you\\'re in a Cobra yoga pose or lifting a set of kettlebells. So after your post-exercise smoothie, Shamban recommends hitting the shower no less than one hour after your workout is done. And don\\'t forget your flip-flops. \"Even in the cleanest establishments, consistently warm, damp environments of gyms, showers and pools (where there is a lot of foot traffic) are breeding grounds for highly contagious viruses like plantar warts or fungi like athlete\\'s foot,\" she says. \"The plantar wart virus can live up to 20 months on surfaces.\" Be kind to your skin. Don\\'t scrub hard or subject it to scalding water. Take a warm shower and use an unscented soap like the Dove Beauty Bar. \"The soaps and cleansers in most gym or public bathrooms are often heavily antibacterial and can really irritate your skin,\" according to Dr. Shamban. If you wash your hair, Chakola suggests washing your face afterward to remove hair product build-up from the skin. And if you\\'re in a rush and you skip washing your hair, try using a dry shampoo to soak up sweat and oils and then pull your hair into a cute topknot to hide oiliness and prevent dirty hair from touching your face. If you use treatment products, Shamban says it is best to wait 10 minutes after bathing and drying your body before applying them in order to give your skin\\'s protective barrier function the chance to reestablish itself. To reduce inflammation on a pimple, place an ice cube directly on it for about 10 seconds on and off repeatedly for about a minute. There are some beauty routines you can keep for the gym. Groom your brows with a spoolie beforehand, pull back your hair into a loose low ponytail and add tinted gloss to your lips to fake looking made-up. \"Also, if your workout clothes are cute and not your brother\\'s old college sweatpants, you\\'ll just feel better about how you look and not have to worry so much about makeup,\" Shamban adds. Moisturizing before workouts isn\\'t really practical, as the lotion is not going to absorb and it can melt and run into your eyes. It can also make your hands slick or make you feel sticky. The exception, of course, is if you\\'re exercising outside, where you\\'ll need a sport-friendly sunscreen. Chakola likes to moisturize immediately after getting out of the shower to lock in moisture. And since no one likes a foundation meltdown, she suggests letting your body cool before applying your makeup. Why You Definitely Shouldn\\'t Wear Makeup To The Gym',\n",

All things equal, Nintendo consoles fall toward the bottom of the list, perhaps because the company places such emphasis on first-party software like \"Mario Kart\" and \"Super Smash Brothers.\" The company makes a lot of money on its own games and original properties, in other words. Some might complain Nintendo\\'s systems also seem a bit outdated by the time they\\'re released -- in terms of sheer horsepower, the Wii lagged behind the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, much as the Wii U is technically less impressive than the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

The New York Times reported on Friday that the cause was cancer. Kaplan was an editor at the Observer for 15 years. During his time there its distinctive salmon-colored pages gained a reputation as an authoritative source on the activities and the foibles of New York\\'s notables. More importantly, the paper became a breeding ground for journalistic talent, and Kaplan pioneered a sharp, sardonic tone that would go on to influence the entire architecture of the media world. As the New Republic put it in a 2012 profile: \"It’s hard to find a major publication right now, in print or online, that’s not in some way flavored by the old Observer...subtract Kaplan from the media landscape of the past 20 years and you lose The Awl, much of Gawker and a good bit of Politico, too.\" Kaplan\\'s career was wide ranging. He left the Observer in 2009, and was most recently the editorial director of the Fairchild Fashion Group. Besides his brothers James and Robert, Kaplan is survived by his second wife Lisa Chase and their son, as well as three children from a previous marriage to Audrey Walker. In the Observer\\'s article on the passing of its former editor, the author recalled a tribute Kaplan wrote on the death of another iconic editor, Clay Felker. The remembrance Kaplan wrote was titled \"Never Hold Your Best Stuff\" and according to the Observer, \"Mr. Kaplan never did.\" Kaplan\\'s death prompted an outpouring of remembrances from the journalism world: Peter Kaplan has died, a great editor.

              "  'context': 'New Mexico is the only state where the average college student has less than $20,000 of debt when she graduates, a report released Thursday shows. For the class of 2013, seven out of 10 college students nationwide carried some form of education debt when they graduated, according to the ninth annual Project on Student Debt report from the Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS), a nonprofit organization. The average graduate was $28,400 in the red, the report says. In six states, students graduated with an average of more than $30,000 in education debt, and only New Mexico grads came in below the $20K mark, with an average of $18,656 in school debt. New Hampshire, Delaware and Pennsylvania had the highest average student debt loads at $32,795, $32,571 and $32,528, respectively. Pennsylvania and New Hampshire also have the most expensive public colleges in the country, according to Department of Education figures. California had the second-lowest average student debt behind New Mexico, with the average Golden State grad owing $20,340, according to Thursday\\'s report. \"As more students borrow, and borrow more,\" the report states, \"concerns about the effects of student loan debt -- for individuals and the broader economy -- have risen.\" \"High student loan debt, risky private loans, and even low debt when paired with low earnings, can hold borrowers back from starting a family, buying a home, saving for retirement, starting a business, or saving for their own children\\'s education,\" the report continues. For-profit colleges were not included in the analysis because out of the 595 proprietary, four-year degree institutions queried for the study, only eight agreed to report debt figures for their 2013 graduates. The report says that of the public and nonprofit private bachelor\\'s degree-granting colleges the researchers contacted, 57 percent agreed to provide data for the analysis. Private student loans currently account for about $150 billion of the outstanding $1.2 trillion in student loan debt nationwide, or about 12 percent of overall education debt. However, nearly 20 percent of the class of 2013 had private student loans, the Project on Student Debt found -- suggesting that the prevalence of such loans could be on the rise. The private student debt load is important to look at, the report says, because those loans often have higher interest rates and offer little if any recourse for borrowers who struggle with high payments. Unlike government loans, private student loans come with no options for income-based repayment or loan forgiveness. \"Where you go to college matters, and the kind of loans you have matter, too,\" said Lauren Asher, president of TICAS. \"Federal student loans come with crucial consumer protections like income-based repayment plans, while private loans offer little or no relief if you hit a rough patch.\" States With Highest Average Student Debt - TICAS - Class Of 2012 Only 1 State\\'s College Students Graduate With Less Than $20,000 Of Debt, Report Finds',\n",

The swimsuit issue, which isn\\'t actually about swimwear at all, but, is, instead, about young, beautifully shaped female bodies, is the single most stolen item in any public library. Shelve it in your magazine section like any other periodical? It\\'ll vanish. Like magic. Always. But hide it behind the Reference Desk and make your patrons sign it out? Is that just good sense? Or is it censorship? Every year, the swimsuit issue gets a bit more lascivious -- the bikinis skimpier, the poses more provocative, the expressions on the models\\' faces less about \"Look at my strong, healthy body!\" and more about \"Do me! Now! Right here on the beach!\" This year\\'s cover shows three stunning young woman, topless, their backs to the camera, smiling happily at the viewer over their shoulders, their gorgeous rumps more revealed that concealed by itty wisps of fabric. Is this really what we want to display on our library\\'s magazine rack? Of course, the collection of my suburban Philadelphia library contains all three books in the Shades of Grey trilogy, and numerous other examples of sexy contemporary \"literature.\" (And the sex scenes in the romances we circulate are hot hot hot.)

What I\\'m saying is that I\\'m all for pornography. But there\\'s a time and a place for porn. I wasn\\'t sure this was the time or the place. I\\'m in charge of processing and then shelving incoming magazines. Before putting this one out on the floor, I decided to consult my supervisor. Carol and I perused the issue together. \"OMG!\" \"Would you look at that?\" \"Yikes!\" \"Do you even SEE a swimsuit in this picture?\" \"Oy!\" \"I hope her mother never sees that shot.\" This was pretty hot stuff. We were inclined to stash it behind the reference desk, along with the other stuff that patrons like to steal. The Tuesday \"Science\" section of the New York Times. The Morningstar weekly stock market updates. But first, we brought the issue to the head of the library. Our boss took a look, then said, \"Just shelve it. Don\\'t treat it differently than any other magazine. It\\'s no worse than what they can see every day on television.\" That woman sure loves the First Amendment. And, of course, the truth is that we\\'re living in an era where anyone, of any age, can view all the naked tushies they want, whenever they want, online. \"Put a security tag on it, of course,\" she added. Although we all know how easy it is to remove those tags. Before I shelved it, my co-workers passed it around. The consensus? We weren\\'t exactly shocked. But we weren\\'t exactly thrilled either. We\\'re all middle-aged women. Many of us are grandmas. Still, in our heyday, we too were hot chicks. But you can be a hot chick and not want to share that aspect of yourself with the entire world. The kind of young woman who is drawn to library work is rarely the kind of young woman who ends up spilling out of her bikini on the cover of a magazine. We librarians don\\'t tend to let it all hang out. Which means that we are, increasingly, at odds with our culture. Modesty? How retro is that?Dignity? Forget about it. Still, we proudly stand behind the First Amendment. Perhaps, to a fault. And while I wasn\\'t exactly elated about adding that little touch of smarm to our quiet reading room, I went ahead and shelved the swimsuit issue, just like any other magazine.

              "  'context': 'Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of Californians support legalizing, regulating and taxing recreational marijuana in the state, according to a Tulchin Research poll. The figure, based on responses of 1,200 likely 2016 voters surveyed during the last two weeks, shows a \"solid majority\" back proposals to legalize adult recreational marijuana, the San Francisco-based pollster said. The poll found 32 percent oppose legalization and 3 percent were undecided. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and American Civil Liberties Union representatives released the poll results during a news conference Thursday and announced the launch of a two-year research effort focused on proposals to legalize recreational marijuana. Newsom will chair a panel of 16 experts, including professors, medical professionals and policy researchers, who will study legal and policy issues involved in adult recreational marijuana. \"This is about real people,\" Newsom said to The Huffington Post. \"Communities are devastated because of this abject thing called the drug war. Forget the politics. This is the right thing to do. \"But we need to answer the tough questions before we put it on the ballot,\" Newsom said. \"I want the research in order to be more convincing to others.\" Not everyone is willing to wait until 2016. Two groups have filed proposals to put recreational pot initiatives on California\\'s 2014 ballot. Both proposals -- the California Cannabis Hemp Initiative and the Marijuana Control, Legalization and Revenue Act -- would regulate and tax marijuana similar to alcohol. And both face an uphill battle in gathering enough funds and volunteers to collect the 504,000 signatures in 150 days needed to make it onto the ballot. The organizers behind California Cannabis Hemp Initiative are collecting signatures, and backers of Marijuana Control, Legalization and Revenue Act are awaiting approval from the state to begin collecting signatures. Other marijuana advocacy groups -- including Newsom\\'s panel -- are working toward a California voter initiative for 2016. \"Voter turnout tends to be much higher in presidential election years,\" Mason Tvert, communications director of the Marijuana Policy Project, told HuffPost. \"We believe a 2016 initiative will best demonstrate just how much support there is for ending marijuana prohibition in California.\" The Drug Policy Alliance echoed this sentiment, saying more education is needed to rally voter support. \"The support for marijuana legalization in California is there,\" Amanda Reiman, policy manager of the Drug Policy Alliance, told HuffPost. \"It just may not be there strongly enough or from the right populations to claim victory in 2014.\" California voters narrowly rejected marijuana legalization in 2010 with Proposition 19. About 53 percent of California voters voted no. Drug Policy Alliance is co-hosting a symposium on legalization in California with the California Society of Addiction Medicine in Denver next week. Reiman said that working with the California Society of Addiction Medicine is part of an effort to win support from California\\'s medical community, which she said is essential to persuade the public. Drug Policy Alliance also is working with environmental and agriculture groups, since much of California marijuana cultivation is outdoors, particularly in the northern counties of Humboldt, Mendocino and Ukiah. California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana when voters passed Proposition 215 in 1996. Since then, the medical cannabis industry has flourished, generating upwards of $100 million in annual tax revenue. \"This is not a matter of 2014 or bust, or 2016 or bust,\" Reiman said. \"Legalization of marijuana in California is going to happen.\" California Is Poised To Legalize Marijuana In 2016',\n",

Rumors have been swirling around Death Stranding ever since Hideo Kojima surprised audiences by debuting the trailer at this year’s E3. Ever since that trailer’s release, fans have been inspecting the footage in a bid to discover any clues as to what the game will be actually about. Kojima has certainly been actively feeding into the mystery surrounding the game, making cryptic statements about how the title \"has already begun\" and going to great pains to prevent leaks about it from reaching the press. With that said, it seems there’s one man, aside from Kojima, who knows more about the game than the average person – and that includes its release date. Icelandic musician Ryan Karazija, one of the members of the band Low Roar that provided the music for the Death Stranding trailer, recently appeared in an interview on the YongYea YouTube channel. During the interview, Karazija gave some insight into what it’s like to work with Kojima and revealed that the game’s release date has already been decided upon. \"We had drinks, we talked, we had good food and laughed a bunch, and he asked about how I made certain sounds on a song, and different things like that. And he showed me, he had his iPad, so he showed me all his pictures about what he was doing, his work with Norman Reedus. So he shows me a bunch of photos, and I know when the game is coming out, and all this stuff, and I can’t tell you guys,\" According to Karazija, it appears that Death Stranding has a set release date, even if he is unable to actually tell anyone when that date is. However, the fact that the game already has a release date in mind is a positive sign that Death Stranding isn’t stuck in development hell and that players will be able to play the game sooner rather than later. News of a solid release date will undoubtedly relieve many Kojima fans of the worry that Death Stranding would fall victim to a fate similar to the cancelled Silent Hills game, which was being developed by Kojima and also starred the lead of Death Stranding, actor Norman Reedus. Gamers hopefully won’t have to wait too long to find out when they’ll be able to get their hands on Death Stranding, as Kojima himself said that Death Stranding will be his best work yet. But until then, fans will just have to keep puzzling over the relation between Reedus’ dog tags and black holes. Death Stranding is in development for both PC and PlayStation 4.

The Washington Office of Financial Management\\'s assessment put state-wide use at 85 metric tons for 2013, but that estimate was based on federal data from 2008 and 2009. Time reports that the difference in the estimates \"very roughly\" amounts to the difference between about 25 and 50 joints per resident each year. The study was conducted in an effort to help the state\\'s liquor control board prepare for the commercial sale of marijuana, which is scheduled to begin in 2014. \"You need to have a good idea about consumption to make decisions about licensing, how many distributors to allow, how many retail shops,\" Beau Kilmer, the lead researcher on the project said, according to Time. \"It’s important to have this information now, because people will want to know what the world looked like before the stores opened up.\" The median estimate of 175 metric tons of marijuana used amounts to more than 6 million ounces, enough for around 340 million joints, according to the Associated Press.

It works like a charm, taking away any pain you have in such a short amount of time. What is there not to love, right? But what about safety? People might be comforted into thinking it is ok, since it is a legal over-the-counter drug. But what people are not aware of is that there are some serious health risks associated with even casual use of the drug. Of those risks, one of the most concerning is the potential for heart damage. Even The FDA is Warning You Even the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been issuing warnings about this drug for the last 11 years emphasizing the dangers of heart damage and failure. The FDA rarely does this, but since recently they decided to become more vocal about the potential dangers of Ibuprofen so they conducted another series of researches and published the following statements: – Even with short term use, one’s heart attack and stroke risk increase significantly. – This risk increases the longer one continues to use ibuprofen. – You do not need to have an existing heart condition to be at risk, although such a condition does increase your chances. Additionally, the FDA categorized people over 40 as the more vulnerable group since 40 is the age at which one’s heart disease begins to skyrocket What is especially alarming is the fact that the FDA has a history of approving some seriously questionable drugs, but even they are waving red flags when it comes to this drug. Don’t Be Fooled One of the biggest problems with over-the-counter drugs like Ibuprofen is that people generally think they pose no major risk so they just shrug and pop pills whenever they think they need to. Hopefully, the information we shared will change your mind in that regard. However, we’re not going to leave you hanging without at least one alternative option for pain relief. Welcome Natural Painkillers! Turmeric, for example, is a plant related to the ginger family. It has a natural ability to block inflammatory cytokines and enzymes and actually prevent inflammation. This is the opposite of most pharmaceutical drugs that only work on reducing inflammation. There are plenty cases, like with rheumatoid arthritis, when turmeric can deliver much better results than any pharmaceutical equivalent.

              "  'context': 'Consumption of this diet starves the brain of much-needed glucose, a new study shows. Consumption of high-fat-content foods causes reduction of glucose levels in the brain, a new study shows. Three days of a high-fat diet in mice led to a depletion of blood glucose reaching the brain and unbalanced the body. It took more than four weeks for the brain to restore the sugar uptake at a cost to the rest of the body. Glucose is the primary fuel and the main source of energy for the brain. When the brain does not get the fuel, this will affect cognitive skills and memory. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Germany examined the mice’s brains to see how a high-fat diet affects them and how this can lead to diabetes and obesity. Dr Alexander Jais, the study author, said: \"A high-fat diet reduces the uptake of blood glucose into the brain in as little as three days. So the brain is starving, even though the mice are consuming a lot of calories daily. Responsible for this is the protein GLUT-1, which is the most important glucose transporter at the blood-brain barrier.\" Free saturated fatty acids can have a toxic effect on the blood-brain barrier cells and reduce the GLUT-1 transporter. The brain has no way to store glucose and some areas of the brain actually lack glucose and they need to get it immediately from the blood stream. These areas include the cerebral cortex — which are responsible for learning and memory — and hypothalamus which controls the metabolism. To compensate for the lack of energy, the brain takes action by using macrophages. Macrophages are particular cells in the immune system and they can produce the growth factor VEGF. This growth factor is part of the system that restores the oxygen supply to tissues and they can increase the production of GLUT-1. The research team was able to measure the glucose levels in mice which were on high-fat diet. They found that the glucose uptake in the brain will still reduce in mice that lack this growth factor. Dr Jais said: \"As a result of this, the mice learn more slowly and have impaired memory.\" When the diet is high in fat the brain is looking for the sugar and to satiate its need will impact the rest of the body. Dr Jais explained: \"We call it the selfish brain, because it gets its glucose by stimulating the body’s appetite for sweet foods and in the long run preventing the uptake in muscles and fat. The cells in the musculature are becoming resistant to insulin, the hormone that normally regulates glucose uptake in the cells of these organs. Ultimately, this leads to the development of diabetes.\" The study was published in Cell (Jais et al., 2016). The Diet That Kills Memory And Cognitive Skills',\n",

After firing 11 shots and brandishing knives at the protesters, the Federal Security Service (FSB) took the two activists into custody. 12 hours later, the Special Forces illegally seized the ship, the Arctic Sunrise, and towed it and its 30 member crew, including American Captain Peter Willcox, to Murmansk where it continues to hold them without formal charges. Peaceful activism is crucial when governments around the world have failed to respond to dire scientific warnings about the consequences of climate change in the Arctic and elsewhere.

              "  'context': '(CNN) Are you having enough sex? You might have wondered if you should up your bedroom activity after reading about other couples\\' resolutions to have sex every day or about all the health benefits of getting horizontal . In what might be welcome news for everyone exhausted from work and frazzled from kids, research suggests you don\\'t have to get down every day to reap the rewards of sex, at least in terms of happiness and relationship closeness. \"I do think couples can end up feeling pressure to try to engage in sex as frequently as possible,\" said Amy Muise , a postdoctoral researcher studying sexual relationships at Dalhousie University in Canada. Once a week \"is maybe a more realistic goal to set than thinking you have to have sex everyday and that feels overwhelming and you avoid it,\" said Muise, who is lead author of the study, which was published in November in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. The study found that sex could boost happiness because it makes people feel more satisfied in their relationship, based on survey data from two separate cohorts, including 2,400 married couples in the U.S. National Survey of Families and Households. \"For people in relationships, their romantic relationship quality is one of the biggest predictors of their overall happiness,\" Muise said. \"Having sex more than once a week might not be enhancing that (relationship connection), although it is not bad.\" However, there are a couple of rubs with this research, Muise said. One is that it is not clear which came first, sex or happiness. It may be that people who have sex once a week or more were happier in their relationship and life to begin with, and not that the sex helped make them happy. Or both may be true: Sex enhances happiness and happiness enhances sex. The other catch is that, although a weekly romp might be just what some people need, it might be too much or too little for others. \"Certainly there are couples for whom having sex less frequently will be fine for their happiness, and there are couples who will get increases in happiness if they have sex more than once a week,\" Muise said. What\\'s the right number for you? \"One of the best effects of an article like this (by Muise and her colleagues) is that it opens up conversations with couples\" about their sex life, said Vanessa Marin, a sex therapist based in Berlin. For some couples, the question of how often they should have sex might not have come up, which could be a sign they feel sufficiently close and satisfied -- or that they are just too busy or disconnected to think about it. \"Most couples want to be having more sex and I think this is really a result of how busy and full most of our lives are,\" Marin said. Marin avoids prescribing an amount of sex that couples should have, because every couple is different, and instead recommends couples test it out for themselves. \"I\\'m a big fan of having clients experiment, like, one month try to have sex twice a week and see how that goes, or once a week, try to play around with it,\" Marin said. As for those lucky couples that are content with how often they get busy under the sheets, one study suggests they may not want to change a thing. Researchers asked couples that were having sex about six times a month to double down on getting down. Couples that doubled their sexual frequency were in worse moods and enjoyed sex less at the end of three months than couples who had stuck to their usual level of bedroom activity. \"Being told you should do something always makes it less fun,\" said George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University and lead author of the study. That is another reason Marin does not make recommendations to couples about sexual frequency -- for fear they could worry they are not living up to expectations and lose their mojo. However, there\\'s a far bigger relationship problem than couples worrying they aren\\'t having quite enough sex -- \"couples that have pretty much stopped having sex,\" Loewenstein said. For these couples, \"I think once a week is a good final goal. ... It is almost like a natural constant to do it once a week,\" he said. Even if these abstinent couples want to be having more sex, they may lack the desire for their partner. These couples can try conventional strategies, such as scheduling more quality time together or trying a change in scenery. \"What couple has not had the experience that you go to a hotel in a new location in a new environment and the person you\\'re with seems different, and different is good when it comes to sex,\" Loewenstein said. But if these tricks aren\\'t enough, couples may have to appeal to their rational rather than lustful side and tell themselves to just do it. \"These couples might be surprised how enjoyable it would be if they restarted,\" Loewenstein said. Should you schedule your sex? It might sound like the least romantic thing in the world to pencil in sexy time with your partner. But if you and your partner are game to try, there is no reason not to make a sex schedule. \"For some couples, scheduling sex works really well, it gives them something to look forward to, they like the anticipation, they like feeling prioritized,\" Marin said. \"Then other couples (say) scheduling sex feels horrible to them, like sex is transactional and just another item on their to-do list.\" Again, Marin recommends couples experiment with scheduling sex to see if it helps them, as long as neither is opposed to it. A good idea for all couples, whether they like the idea of scheduling sex, is to plan for quality time together -- just the two of them. Ideally, this would be about 20 minutes a day with the TV off and cell phones away, but for extra busy couples, it can help to reserve just five minutes a day for a tete-a-tete, Marin said. This time is also the \"container for sex,\" the time and privacy when sex can be initiated, but you don\\'t have to feel pressure about it, she added. Although scheduling sex can help couples that want to be having sex but just can\\'t find the time, it can make things worse for some. \"If there are relationship issues or psychological issues such as stress or anxiety, then scheduling sex might just add to the pressure,\" said Acacia Parks, associate professor of psychology at Hiram College.

As for when to schedule the sex, the best time is probably the time when you are least likely to be pulled away by life\\'s obligations. One of the perks of rise-and-shine sex is that testosterone levels are highest in the morning, and this hormone drives sexual desire. On the other hand, tuck-you-in sex could help lull you to sleep, as hormones released during orgasm could help you relax and feel tired. According to Muise, the participants in her research typically reported having sex at night before going to sleep, which is not that surprising. But it has to work for both parties. \"This is another point of negotiation between partners,\" Muise said. \"One of them is just too exhausted.

After the George & Dragon shut its doors in 2008, the village of Hudswell was left with no other facilities other than a village hall. But, by raising £220,000, the locals were able to buy the pub back and perform extensive renovations. Since opening its doors again in June 2010, the George & Dragon has expanded to offer far more than any traditional pub. It’s the home to the village library, a local shop, community allotments and provides free internet access for its patrons.  Now, The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has given the George & Dragon a top accolade by naming it national pub of the year. Beating more than 50,000 others to the title, CAMRA applauded the pub for it \"welcoming atmosphere\" and \"strong community\" ethos. It was also praised for its range of real ales and cider, along with the beer terrace, which offers panoramic views over the Swale Valley. Stu Miller, Landlord of the George & Dragon said: \"We are truly thrilled to have been recognised by CAMRA with this award.\" \"We\\'re a small Yorkshire Dales pub, owned by the community and run by me and my family, I\\'m extremely proud of what our little pub has achieved.\" But if you can\\'t make it to Yorkshire, be sure to check out the runners-up in the competition which are Salutation Inn in Ham, Gloucestershire, the Stanford Arms in Lowestoft, Norfolk and the Swan with Two Necks in Pendleton, Lancashire.

The Dallas Cowboys (Jerry Jones' team) playing the New England Patriots (Robert Kraft's team) in 2015. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images) There are a handful who bought teams, particularly NFL teams on the cheap years ago, and became billionaires as the value of the teams have risen. Those include folks like the New England Patriots Robert Kraft and the Dallas Cowboys Jerry Jones, whose teams make up the bulk of their net worths. But many more just dabble in sports, investing alongside their friends in everything from football, baseball and basketball to rugby, cricket, auto racing, sailing and of course soccer. FORBES poured through our 2017 billionaire rankings to see just how many billionaires bet on teams. We found 128 from 22 countries, who own stakes, sometimes small, in 147 professional teams in 23 countries, and that could be a conservative number. For our list, we have only considered teams from the top leagues in each country. Minor league baseball teams and second-tier soccer teams for instance, have not been included. Two of London's most prominent soccer teams are both owned by billionaires. Tottenham Hotspur (left) are owned by Joe Lewis and Chelsea (right) is owned by Roman Abramovich. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images) More billionaire's own stakes in soccer teams than any other sport on the planet, which perhaps shouldn't be a huge surprise since it's also the most popular sport on Earth. Forty-two billionaires have stakes in soccer teams. Basketball is second with 34, 32 of which own NBA teams, making it the league with the most billionaire owners (The other two teams are the Chinese Basketball Association's Xinjiang Flying Tigers, owned by Sun Guangxin and Spanish professional team Valencia Basket Club, owned by Juan Roig. The National Football League comes next in terms of leagues with most owners with 21, followed by the NHL with 16. Not all ownership stakes are the same though. Jerry Jones can brag about owning the NFL's most valuable team, the Dallas Cowboys, which is valued at $4.2 billion according to FORBES. On the other side of the coin, billionaire Vincent Viola's 95% stake in the NHL's Florida Panthers is worth $114 million while Bruce Karsh's 4% stake in the Golden State Warriors is worth less than $70 million. Outside of the U.S., the English Premier League has the most billionaire owners with 11, followed by Russia's Kontinental Hockey League with five. There are four billionaires who own Indian cricket teams and three billionaires who own five teams in Mexico's top soccer league, Liga MX. As the United States has easily the most billionaires in the world, it too has the most billionaire sports owners with 72. In a distant second is Russia with 11 billionaires.

Los Angeles also happens to be the city with the most billionaire owners, including the newly arrived Los Angeles Chargers, owned by Alexander Spanos & Family. There are at least 21 owners who own multiple teams including Paul Allen, who owns the Portland Trailblazers and Seattle Seahawks; Tom Benson, who owns the New Orleans Saints and the New Orleans Pelicans' and Terrence Pegula, who owns both the Buffalo Bills and the Buffalo Sabers.

Edrio’s native world of Yar Tonga was conquered and occupied by the Empire, forcing him to flee as a refugee.

              "  'context': \"When people are laying awake at night, they're usually thinking about the short-term effects of their sleeplessness -- the tiring day ahead and how many cups of coffee they'll need to survive. But a new, small study suggests the harmful effects of poor sleep or not enough sleep can be problematic over the long-term as well. The study found older people who don't get enough restful sleep have brain imaging patterns similar to people suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health looked at data from 70 adults with an average age of 76 and reported higher deposits of beta-amyloid in those who didn't sleep much or very well. Beta-amyloid is a protein found in the brain, which tends to form into clusters and eventually into plaque that is the telltale sign of Alzheimer's. Normal sleep-wake patterns actually help regulate levels of beta-amyloid. The participants reported sleeping upwards of 7 hours at the higher end, and no more than 5 hours at the lower end. Since the data was taken from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging, the country's longest running study on aging, researchers say they will need to conduct further trials to know if sleep disturbance necessarily precedes beta-amyloid buildup. The study does open doors to future research studying whether or not bettering a person's sleep can prevent or delay beta-amyloid buildup and Alzheimer's progression. Other studies have also shown a link between lack of sleep and memory. Earlier this year, a study showed older adults can experience memory loss and brain degeneration as a result of sleeplessness, The Huffington Post reported. There have also been various conflicting studies debating whether people really need less sleep as they age. One thing's for certain, the improved cognition, increased attention-span, and overall better health that comes with getting enough Z's is enough to convince us to get to bed early.

Findings imply that, as soon as young people come of age, they ditch the weed and take up alcohol instead. For those under 21, marijuana could simply be the most accessible of the substances, but according to a University of Illinois study, Americans drastically switch from smoking marijuana to consuming booze when they change from 20 years and 11 months old to the legal drinking age. Researchers analyzed five years of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, along with responses from survey participants between the ages of 18 to 24 who recounted the number of times they\\'d consumed alcohol or used marijuana over the past 30 days. The likelihood that they had consumed alcohol within 30 days jumped by 16 percent, while pot use fell by 10 percent. Researchers regard the findings as essential to the debate over how to regulate the substances, how marijuana laws are enforced will ultimately affect alcohol use, and the other way around according to Ben Crost, a co-author of the study, \"If you think alcohol is much more harmful to people\\'s health, then you should probably restrict alcohol use,\" Crost said in a statement. \"If you think marijuana is more harmful, then you might want to consider loosening the restrictions for alcohol.\" Crost suggests officials should reassess the minimum legal drinking age, noting restrictions on booze appear to push young adults towards illegal drugs.Or maybe weed doesn\\'t need to be illegal.

Certain songs just seem to strike a chord in your heart (pun intended). Some make you melancholy while others can make you feel really good. The reason why is a bit fuzzy. However, that hasn’t stopped one scientist in the United Kingdom from trying. Cognitive neuroscientist Dr. Jacob Jenji used science to determine what exactly was the most \"feel-good song,\" according to the Huffington Post. He concluded that the most feel-good song ever is... Queen’s infectious ’70s anthem \"Don’t Stop Me Now.\" The song wasn’t a huge hit when it was released in 1978. It only reached number 86 on the US music charts and viewed as one of Queen’s lesser songs, it was only performed live once. However, it has grown in popularity since then and is now one of the band’s most well-known songs. \"Don’t Stop Me Now\" was the most common response when British electronics manufacturer Alba surveyed 2,000 adults in the U.K. about their favorite feel-good songs.

In an email, he told the Huffington Post: \"My analysis confirmed very nicely what we already knew from the literature: Songs written in a major key with fast tempo are best at inducing positive emotions\" The said that when analyzed all the \"feel-good\" songs had were at least 10 BPM faster than the average pop song and most of them were written in a major key.

Apparently the diamond business is experiencing a slow period , because the newest trend for millennials is to marry later in their 20’s and 30’s, and choose more distinctive wedding jewelry that accounts for their concern with money, sustainability, and material. Many young people of today don’t want their engagement and wedding rings to be mass-produced, they want a piece that’s unique to them and also doesn’t cost a fortune. And so, millennials are favoring gemstones, sapphires, and lab-grown diamonds over actual diamonds. This may be because they’re no longer concerned with age-old marriage rituals, and colorful stones might reflect their taste better. The trend may also have something to do with greater awareness about the human rights issues surrounding diamond mining and production in some regions. While some companies take pains to provide \"conflict-free\" stones , it’s possible that rights-sensitive millennials may prefer to avoid the gems altogether. — which have typically been viewed as the symbol of \"enduring love.\" The slogan they have adopted for their campaign is, \"Real is rare, real is a diamond.\" Of course, this campaign will use social media to attract the attention of millennials, and they expect to see positive results, hoping that worldwide sales of traditionally mined diamonds to grow this year.

In 95 of the 100 largest cities in America, traffic congestion worsened from 2013 to 2014, according to a study from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, a research institute that develops solutions for transportation problems, released this month that’s compared to worsening traffic conditions in just 61 of the 100 cities from 2012 to 2013. \"The national congestion recession is over,\" the study authors conclude. Data for the study came from the U.S. Department of Transportation and the individual states, and the study methodology is described in detail here. This is thanks in large part to the fact that the U.S. economy has added more than 9 million jobs since the recession began, which means more people are now commuting to work. The unemployment rate was just 5.3% in July compared to 7.3% at the end of 2008. The congestion problem isn’t going anywhere anytime soon either: A report by the U.S. Travel Association found that commuters on many cities highways will soon experience Labor Day-like gridlock — Labor Day is typically one of the busiest travel days of the year — on the average day of the week. Some already are: \"Within many cities, already almost every day is like Labor Day,\" says Erik Hansen, who managed the study, referencing the summer holiday that traditionally generates the nation’s worst traffic jams. Millions of Americans waste more hours of their lives in traffic than they did three decades ago: Those traveling during peak travel hours will spend an average of 42 extra hours each year on the road (up from 18 in 1982) thanks to traffic, the Texas A&M Transportation Institute report revealed. That’s 6.9 billion hours for commuters on the whole — \"more than the time it would take to drive to Pluto and back, if there was a road,\" the authors note. What’s more, in cities with more than one million people, commuters experienced an average of 63 hours of extra travel time each year. And in some cities, that’s even worse. Here are the 10 cities in which residents waste the most hours of their lives sitting in traffic: 1. Washington, D.C. Commuters in our nation’s capital spend an average of 82 hours extra a year on the road thanks to traffic gridlock, making this the most congested city in America. This extra drive time costs the average auto commuter $1,834 per year (this number was calculated using a combination of the value of the travel delay — estimated at $17.67 per hour per person — and the average cost of gas in the state). 2. Los Angeles, Long Beach and Anaheim The L.A. area comes in a close second when it comes to traffic congestion: Residents there spend an extra 80 hours a year in the car and $1,711 thanks to clogged roadways. 3. San Francisco and Oakland Auto commuters in the Bay Area are wasting an extra 78 hours of their year in traffic — and that’s costing them $1,675. That may make working for some of the more high-profile tech companies (ahem, Facebook and Google) in the area even more appealing, as many provide you with swanky buses to get to and from the office. 4. New York and Newark While the New York metro area ranks No. 4 in terms of the extra hours per year spent commuting (74), it ranks No. 2 in terms of what that costs residents ($1739). 5. San Jose, Calif. Though it’s not an exceptionally large city, it has outsized traffic congestion: Commuters here waste 67 hours in traffic at a cost of $1,422 per commuter each year. It’s one of only two cities in the top 10 that has fewer than three million residents. 6. Boston As anyone who’s sat (and sat) on I-90 or I-93 knows, it’s slow moving in Boston. Indeed, Bostonians waste 64 hours a year in traffic gridlock at a cost of $1,388. 7. Seattle In rainy Seattle, commuters who travel during peak times are forced to spend an extra $1,491 a year (in extra gas costs and the cost of lost time) thanks to gridlock as well as 63 additional hours in the car. 8. Chicago Residents of the Windy City spend an average of 61 extra hours in the car each year at a cost of $1,445. 9. Houston Houston ties with Chicago in terms of the number of wasted commuter hours each year (61), though residents there spend a little more in terms of gas costs and the costs of their lost time than in Chicago ($1,490 vs. $1,445) because of it. 10. Riverside and San Bernardino This is the fourth metro area in California to make this list, and one of only two cities with fewer than three million residents to make it (the other was San Jose). Commuters here waste 57 hours a year and spend $1,316, thanks to traffic gridlock. The 10 cities with the most horrific traffic',\n",

As in that game, you can venture into Breath of the Wild \\'s more than 100 dungeons (called \"shrines\") in whatever order you like. Just don\\'t expect the enemies lying in wait to be homogenous pushovers. That\\'s part of how Nintendo\\'s regulating progression through the game this time: With great freedom comes the likelihood that you\\'ll wander into a growling goblin\\'s nest. Nintendo On the other hand, Nintendo says it hopes you\\'ll do just that, which is where the subtitle \"Breath of the Wild\" comes in. At a pre-E3 event, the game\\'s producer Eiji Aonuma explained that instead of coming up with a title based on a central story item (ocarinas, swords, caps, hourglasses) or character (Link, Majora, the eponymous twilight princess), the team wanted it to emblematize the world itself. So \"wild\" in the sense that Nintendo wants experimentation and surprise by way of the open, unexplored world design to be \"the soul of the experience.\" That carries through the game\\'s visual style, inspired by a form of water color art called gouache , said Nintendo. It\\'s further informed by an approach to painting known as en plein air , or \"open air,\" where the artist attempts to replicate the moment of an experience (to give that a bit of context, impressionists like Monet and Renoir were proponents of the approach). In practice, it\\'s something like a hybridization of the look in the last few games, as if The Wind Waker \\'s cel-shading were merged with Twilight Princess \\'s quasi-realistic style. The world, which I was able to dash and scramble around for roughly 30 minutes, feels as grand as teased in earlier sneak peeks , and the team says wherever you can see you can go \"and beyond.\" In the demo, we were allowed to explore a partly forested area Nintendo said represented just 1% of the total explorable world. Zoom the map out, and that world becomes a sprawl of regions grouped into valleys, jungles, mountains and—Treehouse\\'s Bill Trinen teased this last—possibly even the ocean. All told, Nintendo says Breath of the Wild is 12 times the size of Twilight Princess (itself no slouch in the epic fantasy world Olympics). Jumping and free-roaming are just the start of the game\\'s rethinking of cherished Zelda tropes. Instead of cutting grass to conjure life-replenishing hearts, you hunt for or harvest ingredients consumable raw for minor performance boosts. Combine these in a cooking pan, by contrast, and you can craft edibles with perks in what looks to be an elaborate recipe chasing mini-game. The weather plays a role now, too. Sudden downpours can douse fires, and brandishing a metallic object during a lightning storm may have the sort of jolting repercussions you\\'d imagine. There\\'s even a temperature gauge you\\'ll need to keep tabs on, donning warmer clothes to survive colder environments and vice versa. Nintendo Link\\'s arsenal of axes, clubs and long blades are more transient and break easily, and part of maintaining your arsenal involves stealing new ones from enemies. Enemies no longer roam at random, but occupy colonies and encampments, and they\\'re meant to have a sense of situational purposefulness, says Nintendo. Wait until nighttime (1 minute of realtime = 1 hour of game time) and they\\'ll sleep, making them easier to sneak up on, and sneaking\\'s also a thing: Move quickly and an audio meter bounces erratically to indicate your conspicuousness; crouch, and the meter flattens to let you know you\\'ve become sonically invisible. A new and apparently intricate physics framework empowers distinctive tactics. Chop down a hillside tree (yes, Link can chop down trees) and it\\'ll topple, then roll downhill, clearing whatever\\'s in its path (or, if near a crevasse, become a bridge you can clamber across). The same for boulders, which you can shove down inclines to flatten foes. The series\\' spherical bombs now come in multiple flavors, including one you can ply the environment to roll or push around like a pinball. Hop on Link\\'s shield and he\\'ll surf, Legolas-like, down mountainsides. And there\\'s a paraglider with which Link can soar high above areas, taking in the view to spy hidden items or suss alternate approach paths. What\\'s to stop players from immediately ranging across half the map with impunity? Climb or fly without pause and a circular stamina meter gradually dwindles until Link plummets. I take that to mean there\\'ll be plenty of climbing and flying puzzles, where you\\'ll have to plot approach paths by locating and folding respite points into lengthy climbs or glides. (That, or come up with recipes for stamina-bolstering victuals.) As promised, you can use the Wolf Link amiibo to import that character as a companion who\\'ll stay with Link until defeated (at which point you have to wait 24 hours of real world time to re-import him). Level up Wolf Link\\'s health playing Twilight Princess , and he\\'ll have the same number of hearts playing at Link\\'s side in Breath of the Wild ; import him cold, and he\\'ll be stuck with just three (a clear prod to Wii U fans who\\'ve yet to buy that game bundle ). Nintendo\\'s also making two new amiibo, one of Link holding a bow (Archer Link) and another of him on horseback (Rider Link), but the team wasn\\'t ready to say how they\\'ll function in the game. Nintendo It\\'s not clear what Link\\'s up to or who he\\'s ultimately squaring off with in the Zelda-verse this time, but Aonuma confirmed this version of Link has been snoozing for 100 years (he wakes and rises from a tomb-like bed at the game\\'s start). And when someone asked where this Zelda slots in the lore, Aonuma pointed to the t-shirt he came wearing, inscribed with a variation on the Sheikah eye symbol that\\'s appeared in Zelda games since Ocarina of Time . Make of that what you will, said Aonuma with a sly smile. Towards the end of my demo, in the belly of a rune-scrawled shrine, I got my hands on one of the game\\'s most intriguing new items: A magnet that lets you seize and then wing large objects around. All I managed to do before the demo ended was to yank a panel off the floor (unearthing a passage) and levitate a large block (to clear my route, but it also looked like I might be able to lob it at enemies). But my sense was that it\\'ll be a central part of this philosophical shift to a \"single puzzle, multiple solutions\" motif. Important questions remain, the most obvious being how players are going to be able to have the same experience on the Wii U and NX versions—a point confirmed by Aonuma during the presentation—if the NX is truly something \"unique and different.\" We\\'ll know soon enough, when the company unveils the Wii U\\'s successor later this year.

It gives her an advantage in the pool over her female competitors since most do not have the strength to sustain it. (Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) Katie Ledecky proved once again she is the best female Olympic swimmer of our time on Tuesday night when she won gold in the women’s 200-meter freestyle at the Summer Olympics in Rio. She finished the race in 1:53.73, edging out Sweden’s Sarah Sjostrom, who won silver with a time of 1:54.08. \"I did come pretty close to throwing up during that last 50,\" Ledecky said after the race. \"I knew I just needed to get my hand on the wall and be done. Everything was hurting. ... I just had to dig deep and do my own thing. I had no idea whether I touched first. ... I was done when I touched the wall. I knew I’d given it everything I had to.\" [Michael Phelps extends his legacy with two more gold medals at Rio Olympics] Up next for Ledecky is the 800-meter freestyle. If she wins gold, Ledecky will join Debbie Meyer (1968) as just the second female in Olympics history to win three individual freestyle gold medals in the same Games. But Ledecky could do something even more extraordinary: break the eight-minute mark, a feat that, up until this point, has been seen only in the men’s competition. It’s not as crazy as it sounds. Ledecky has lowered the world record in the 800-meter freestyle by more than seven seconds in 29 months to its current 8:06.68. Before that, it took 26 years to lower the record by the same amount. According to FiveThirtyEight’s Benjamin Morris, Ledecky \"is pretty much the Secretariat of swimming\" whose \"performance in the 800 freestyle is the most any swimmer has dominated any distance.\" Ledecky already set a world record in the 400 freestyle earlier in the Games with a sizzling time of 3:56.46, making her the second woman (Italy’s Federica Pellegrini was the first in 2009) to swim the 400 freestyle in less than four minutes. It’s also the the 12th world record Ledecky has set since the 2012 London Olympics. Extrapolating her 400 freestyle gold-medal winning time in Rio, Ledecky would swim the 800 freestyle in 7:52.92. And while it is unreasonable to think Ledecky can maintain her 400-meter pace for twice the distance, that seven-second cushion could be enough to get her under eight minutes. Since 1968, there have been 10 women to compete in the 200, 400 and 800 freestyle events. The average finalist swam at a pace 14 seconds slower than their 400-meter time, and two — Irina Aksyonova (1980) and Keena Rothhammer (1972) — were within 10 seconds of their projected 800-meter time based on their actual 400-meter finishes. Rothhammer lost just 5.24 seconds off her pace when she made the distance switch in Munich, so there is precedent. But based on everything Ledecky has done so far, who would bet her against her?

But they aren’t the only company stinging from the collapse of a proposed $45 billion buyout of Time Warner Cable. A number of Wall Street banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase, lost out big with the Thursday’s news that Comcast is throwing in the towel on it’s 14-month pursuit of Time Warner Cable. The deal unravelled just hours after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recommended that the proposed merger be reviewed by a federal judged over antitrust concerns. For Comcast, the nation’s largest cable provider, it means missing out on the chance to gobble up its number two competitor and thoroughly dominate cable and high-speed Internet access across the United States. But for 14 different Wall Street banks, it means losing out on nearly $400 million they stood to gain from what the Wall Street Journal described as one of the \"biggest deal-related paydays in years.\" According to WSJ, advisory fees alone were set to surpass $320 million, with an additional $60 million in other fees. That would have set a record exceeding the roughly $270 million Wall Street made in 2001 from Comcast’s purchase of AT&T’s broadband service. Part of what drove the cost of the deal so high were the \"multiple, interlocking transactions\" that sprang up around the proposed deal, WSJ reporter Liz Hoffman writes. Contingent on Comcast purchasing Time Warner Cable were two separate deals involving Charter Communications, a company that had previously attempted to purchase Time Warner. If the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal had gone through, Charter was set to purchase Bright House Networks LLC, a smaller cable and Internet provider. It also would have purchased a portion of Comcast’s subscribers that were to be sold off in an effort to ease monopoly concerns. These two deals were valued at $30 billion and also stood to generate tens of millions of dollars in fees on their own. Of all the banks associated with this massive, multi-faceted deal, Chase had the most to gain, roughly $25 million. Now, with the deal’s collapse, both Chase and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP not only miss out on a major payday, but the WSJ reports that they are likely to lose their \"coveted spots\" on Thomson Reuters’ rankings of mergers and acquisitions firms, which would have allowed them to attract other major clients and charge higher fees.

The New York Times has more: In recent years, scientists have debated based on mixed evidence whether a father\\'s age is linked to his child\\'s vulnerability to individual disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Some studies have found strong associations, while others have found weak associations or none at all. The new report, which looked at many mental disorders in Sweden, should inflame the debate, if not settle it, experts said. Men have a biological clock of sorts because of random mutations in sperm over time, the report suggests, and the risks associated with later fatherhood may be higher than previously thought. The findings were published on Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. \"This is the best paper I\\'ve seen on this topic, and it suggests several lines of inquiry into mental illness,\" said Dr. Patrick F. Sullivan, a professor of genetics at the University of North Carolina, who was not involved in the research. \"But the last thing people should do is read this and say, \\'Oh no, I had a kid at 43, the kid\\'s doomed.\\' The vast majority of kids born to older dads will be just fine.\" Dr. Kenneth S. Kendler, a professor of psychiatry and human molecular genetics at Virginia Commonwealth University, also urged caution in interpreting the results. \"This is great work from a scientific perspective,\" he said. \"But it needs to be replicated, and biomedical science needs to get in gear and figure out what accounts for\" the mixed findings of previous studies. The strengths of the new report are size and rigor. The research team, led by Brian M. D\\'Onofrio of Indiana University, analyzed medical and public records of some 2.6 million people born in Sweden from 1973 to 2001. Like many European countries, Sweden has centralized medical care and keeps detailed records, so the scientists knew the father\\'s age for each birth and were able to track each child\\'s medical history over time, as well as that of siblings and other relatives. Among other things, the analysis compared the mental health of siblings born to the same father and found a clear pattern of increased risk with increasing paternal age. Compared with the children of young fathers, aged 20 to 24, those born to men age 45 and older had about twice the risk of developing psychosis, the signature symptom of schizophrenia; more than three times the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of autism; and about 13 times the chance of having a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder. Children born to older fathers also tended to struggle more with academics and substance abuse. The researchers controlled for every factor they could think of, including parents\\' education and income. Older couples tend to be more stable and have more income — both protective factors that help to temper mental problems — and this was the case in the study. But much of the risk associated with paternal age remained. \"We spent months trying to make the findings go away, looking at the mother\\'s age, at psychiatric history, doing sub-analyses,\" Dr. D\\'Onofrio said. \"They wouldn\\'t go away.\" Older Dads May Have Kids with Greater Mental Illness Risk',\n",

While researchers aren't sure why a B12 deficiency affects the tongue, you may develop neurological problems, including dementia, if your levels stay low for too long. Protect Yourself: Meat and dairy products are rich in B12, so if you're a vegetarian or vegan, you may have a harder time reaching your daily allowance. Make sure to take a multivitamin, and consider eating fortified cereals for breakfast (some offer 100 percent of your recommended daily value of B12 in one serving). White Skin When pigment-producing skin cells die, you're left with white spots that retain the same texture as the rest of your skin but lack melanin. This condition, known as vitiligo, affects up to two million Americans, the majority of cases occurring in people under 40. It's most noticeable where skin is usually a bit darker -- hands, feet, arms, face, lips. But it can also occur in the armpits, nostrils, and even on your scalp. Researchers think vitiligo may be the result of an autoimmune disease that causes your body to mistakenly attack its own cells; it's associated with thyroid disease and Addison's disease (in which your adrenal glands stop producing enough of the hormones that help control everything from your immune response to your sex drive). Protect Yourself: While there's currently no way to prevent most autoimmune diseases, you may be able to treat your white patches with corticosteroid creams, which have been shown to be effective in restoring some pigmentation. And I can't stress how important it is to wear sunscreen. Without melanin, your skin is at much higher risk for sunburns. To conceal the spots while shielding your skin, opt for a tinted moisturizer with at least SPF 30. Yellow Elbows, knees, hands and feet The appearance of soft, yellowish bumps (called xanthomas) on your body -- particularly on your elbows, knees, hands, and feet -- can indicate dangerously high cholesterol levels, which increase your risk for cardiovascular problems including heart disease and stroke. These growths, which are painless and can range from very small to wider than three inches, are actually fat deposits that build up under the skin, often when an excess amount of lipids -- due to either a genetic condition or a high-fat diet -- accumulates in your blood. Protect Yourself: Nearly 54 million women have high or borderline-high cholesterol, with 19 million falling in the high range. But while maintaining a healthy diet can certainly help keep cholesterol under control, when it comes to lowering your levels of LDL (the bad kind), exercise is critical. A 2009 study in the Journal of Lipid Research found that women who walked one extra hour or jogged an additional 30 minutes per week lowered their LDL levels by 3 percent or more. They also saw an increase in their levels of HDL (the good kind). Even better news: Once cholesterol is back in a healthy range, xanthomas may start to clear up. Black Neck, armpits and groin Dark, velvety patches found in your armpits and on your neck and groin are likely acanthosis nigricans. This slow-developing skin condition, which is more common in overweight and obese adults, can be a sign of type 2 diabetes. Researchers believe that insulin resistance (which causes high blood sugar and can lead to type 2 diabetes) can send some skin cells into overdrive, increasing skin thickness and darkening pigment. Protect Yourself: To help prevent diabetes, pay particular attention to your diet. Filling up on high-fiber foods (think oatmeal, beans, and broccoli) can slow the body's absorption of sugar and, as a result, may keep blood sugar within a healthy range. One study found that prediabetics who consumed the most fiber were 62 percent less likely to develop full-blown diabetes than those who consumed the least. Brown Nails The next time you do your monthly body check for new moles or dark spots, be sure to examine your nails. Dark, vertical bands (they're typically brown but can also appear blue or black) under your nail beds -- most commonly on your thumb or big toe -- could be a type of melanoma. While melanoma accounts for less than 5 percent of skin cancers in the United States, it's responsible for 75 percent of skin cancer deaths because it often goes undetected. And your risk is greatly affected by the color of your skin: Among Caucasians, only 2 to 3 percent of melanomas are found under the nail, but that number is as high as 40 percent among the rest of the population. Malignant melanomas can be easily treated if caught early, so make an appointment with a dermatologist if you notice any dark bands on your nails. She'll do a biopsy if she suspects cancer. Protect Yourself: As with all skin cancers, prevention is key. When you apply sunscreen in the morning, take the time to coat your nails and cuticles. Maintaining strong nails can also help shield the skin beneath, so keep them well moisturized to prevent cracking and flaking. And if you use nail polish, keep in mind that some brands now offer added UV protection. Dr. Oz: What The Color Of Your Tongue Can Tell You About Your Health\",\n",

In case you\\'re not familiar with Sterling, he\\'s the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, a National Basketball Association organization whose roster and coaching staff is almost entirely African American. Oh, he\\'s also the guy who was allegedly recorded telling his girlfriend not to post pictures on her Instagram of African Americans and not to \"bring them to the game.\" As this story unfolds in the media, chances are you\\'re going to hear people refer back to these comments, get quotes from Magic Johnson (who appeared in the Instagram photo), revere the furious Michael Jordan, and hopefully bash Sterling for being a bigoted hypocrite. But before we become engrossed in our own rage and spend the next week crucifying this man, it is important to stop and consider the value in this moment: We have been let into the mentality of true, American racism. Let\\'s learn from him and make the most out of this moment to do battle with the people that share his prejudices. Sterling\\'s comments about not bringing African Americans to the game will be repeated the most, but they may be the least frightening. What Sterling said that should scare you more than anything comes when he tells his half-black, half-Mexican girlfriend that she\\'s \"supposed to be a delicate white or a delicate Latina girl.\" You should shudder when he, a white, Jewish man, says, \"Hispanics feel certain things towards blacks. Blacks feel certain things towards other groups. It\\'s been that way historically and it will always be that way.\" As a fellow Jew, I\\'m embarrassed and ashamed that Sterling doesn\\'t understand, vilify and denounce any form of denigration or racism. These comments reflect three major beliefs of today\\'s racists in America: 1) Non-white people have an obligation to suppress their heritage; 2) Social divides created by skin color and ethnicities have always been that way and will always be that way; 3) A white man somehow has a better understanding of how minorities feel towards each other than the actual minorities he\\'s discussing (i.e., his \"girlfriend\"). I also won\\'t ignore the fact that Sterling allegedly used to bring women into the locker room showers after games, putting his players on display to show off \"their beautiful black bodies.\" I won\\'t avert my eyes from his 2.73 million dollar settlement for charges of discriminatory renting practices against Hispanics, blacks and families with children in 2005, either. It is clear now, if it wasn\\'t entirely clear before, that Donald Sterling is a bigoted man, one that does not understand or appreciate the tremendous influence of a diverse culture in our country. Still, these comments do not make Donald Sterling the world\\'s worst racist. They shouldn\\'t make him public enemy number one in our country. What the comments do is open the door for a stand against this attitude. Unfortunately for the NBA, they are all but powerless against these comments and this owner. They may suspend him, although it\\'d be the first time in 14 years an NBA owner was suspended, and it won\\'t stop the money from flowing in.

Fans should boycott his games until he is gone. .@cjbycookie and I will never go to a Clippers game again as long as Donald Sterling is the owner. — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) April 26, 2014 The stands should be empty and you should devalue his 12.5 million dollar a year TV deal by refusing to tune into games. We should flood his inbox and home address with letters of indignation, tales of persecution, and pleas for him to extend his education on the continued plight of minority groups here and abroad. I know what the hardcore sports fans are thinking: How could you leave the players hanging in the middle of the playoffs? Why punish the athletes for their owner? As a diehard sports fan, I sympathize with this point and the balancing act of loving a team and hating an owner. Still, though, the real question is what better time than the playoffs? What better time to prove a game is not more important than a movement? In 20 years, those athletes and our children aren\\'t going to talk about how many fans were in the stands for game five of the first round playoff series against Golden State. They are going to talk about how sports fans weighed their fandom against their moral obligations in 2014. They are going to discuss what was more important to us; watching a basketball game or sending a message to what\\'s left of rich, white racists in America who have a blatant disregard for the cultural background of the players we allegedly support. They are going to talk about wins and losses, but not the ones you\\'re thinking.

              "  'context': 'How old is the binary number system? Perhaps far older than the invention of computers or even the invention of binary math in the West. The residents of a tiny Polynesian island may have been doing calculations in binary—a number system with only two digits—centuries before it was described by Gottfried Leibniz, the co-inventor of calculus, in 1703. If you’re reading this article, you are almost certainly a user of the decimal system. That system is also known as base-10 because of its repeating pattern of 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is followed by 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and so forth. But the decimal system is not the only counting system available. The Babylonians used base-60. The Mayas used base-20. Some Australian aboriginal groups may have used base-5. And of course, today most counting and calculation is done by computers not in decimal but binary, the base-2 system of zeros and ones. Each system has subtle advantages depending on what sort of counting and calculations are needed. The decimal system is handy considering that people have 10 fingers. But when it comes to division, other systems are better. Because 10 has only two prime factors (2 and 5), dividing by thirds results in an annoyingly infinite approximation (0.3333 ... ) whereas the base-12 counting system produces a nice finite solution. (Indeed, some mathematicians have advocated for a worldwide switch to base-12.) Binary, meanwhile, has a leg up on decimal when it comes to calculation, as Leibniz discovered 300 years ago. For example, although numbers in binary become much longer, multiplying them is easier because the only basic facts one must remember are 1 x 1 = 1 and 0 x 0= 1 x 0 = 0 x 1 = 0. But Leibniz may have been scooped centuries earlier by the people of Mangareva, a tiny island in French Polynesia about 5000 kilometers south of Hawaii. While studying their language and culture, Andrea Bender and Sieghard Beller, anthropologists at the University of Bergen in Norway, were astonished to find a mathematical system that seems to mix base-10 and base-2. \"I was so thrilled that I couldn\\'t sleep that night,\" Bender says. It could be not only the first new indigenous arithmetic system discovered in decades, but also the first known example of binary arithmetic developed outside Eurasia. Like all Polynesians, the people who first settled on Mangareva more than 1000 years ago had a decimal counting system. But, according to Bender and Beller, the islanders added a binary twist over the ensuing centuries. Just like English has a few special words like a dozen for 12 and a score for 20, the Mangarevan language has special words for large groups. But their special counting words are all decimal numbers multiplied by powers of two, which are 1, 2, 4, 8 ... . Specifically, takau equals 10; paua equals 20; tataua, 40; and varu, 80. Those big numbers are useful for keeping track of collections of valuable items, such as coconuts, that come in large numbers. Bender and Beller realized that the Mangarevan counting system makes it possible to use binary arithmetic for calculations of large numbers, they report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in a paper that even nonexperts will enjoy reading. But here’s the catch. Even if the native mathematical system of Mangareva employed binary arithmetic, the current residents of the island no longer use that system. Two centuries of contact with the West has resulted in a complete switch to decimal calculation. Even the Mangarevan language itself is now threatened with extinction. Bender and Beller are relying on their analysis of the language and an account of the traditional counting words written by ethnographers in 1938. They acknowledge that it is impossible to prove exactly when Mangareva developed the system, but the entrenchment of the number terms in the language suggests a far-reaching origin. Unfortunately, the anthropologists may have made their discovery just one generation too late to see Mangarevan math in action. \"The hypothesis advanced by the authors is indeed plausible,\" says Rafael Núñez, an anthropologist at the University of California, San Diego, \"but the absence of original Mangarevan written records constitutes a real challenge.\" However, Núñez notes that ironically, \"it is the absence of written practices in this culture that makes the hypothesis plausible.\" Keeping track of all those calculations in their heads would have been so much easier with the binary math built into the Mangarevan language, he says.

A new study published this week in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that approximately one-third of patients with what researchers referred to as \"treatment-resistant depression\" experienced a significant mood improvement after being treated with up to six intravenous ketamine infusions over the course of several weeks. \"Three days after the last infusion, the depression scores had halved in 29 percent of the patients,\" said a news release on the study, which was conducted by United Kingdom researchers at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Oxford. \"In those that responded to the treatment, the duration of benefit varied widely, lasting between 25 days and 8 months\" Lead researcher Dr. Rupert McShane said some of the patients involved in the study had lived with depression for 20 years. \"It really is dramatic for some people,\" he told the BBC of the improvements seen in some of the study\\'s subjects. \"It\\'s the sort of thing really that makes it worth doing psychiatry, it\\'s a really wonderful thing to see.\" McShane\\'s study had a small sample of just 28 patients, but his isn\\'t the first to link ketamine -- a Schedule III drug known on the street as \"Special K\" or simply \"K\" -- with effective treatment for depression. Several studies conducted in the past decade or so supported the idea that ketamine could treat major depression effectively and quickly. In 2012, for example, researchers from Yale University said ketamine seems to \"produce rapid antidepressant responses in patients who are resistant to typical antidepressants.\" \"It\\'s exciting,\" Ron Duman, co-author of that study, told NPR at the time. \"The hope is that this new information about ketamine is really going to provide a whole array of new targets that can be developed that ultimately provide a much better way of treating depression.\" Another study, conducted by researchers at Houston\\'s Baylor College of Medicine and New York\\'s Mount Sinai School of Medicine, had similar results. Published last year, the study -- said to have been the largest of its kind -- found that 64 percent of patients who had been treated with ketamine reported fewer depression symptoms. Though ketamine\\'s purported ability to relieve depression for some individuals has been welcomed by many experts as a possible step forward in the search for better treatments for depression, there are many health risks associated with the drug. Commonly used as an anesthetic for both humans and animals, ketamine is described by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration as a dissociative anesthetic with hallucinogenic properties. Some users say that, when taken at high enough doses, the drug can induce a terrifying out-of-body experience known commonly as a \"K-hole.\" The drug is also known to cause anxiety, amnesia and cognitive difficulties. Medical experts have strictly warned against self-medicating with ketamine. In clinical studies, the drug is typically administered only in small doses, and patients are always supervised closely.

Take Barkhad Abdi, the 28-year-old Somali-born actor who was nominated in the Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role category by SAG for his work in \"Captain Phillips.\" \"I don\\'t know how to thank them,\" Abdi told HuffPost Entertainment mere hours after being nominated. \"It\\'s really an honor. I was not expecting it, honestly, but I\\'m so happy about it.\" Abdi plays Muse in \"Captain Phillips,\" the lead Somali pirate who takes the film\\'s title character, played by Tom Hanks, hostage after a botched hijacking attempt. (The Paul Greengrass film is based on the real-life kidnapping of Captain Richard Phillips in 2009.) The actor said he hadn\\'t even been keeping tabs on just when the Screen Actors Guild would reveal its nominees (\"I knew it was one of these days, but I didn\\'t know it was today\"), but he was awake in time to hear his name read aloud during the early morning announcement. The SAG Award nomination is the highest-profile nod to date for Abdi, who has also earned plaudits from critics groups in Boston, St. Louis and Detroit. He praised Hanks, a fellow SAG Award nominee for \"Captain Phillips\" in the lead actor category, for his guidance through the grind of awards season. \"He told me to be yourself,\" Abdi said. \"Just be yourself and be honest about everything.\" As Abdi told HuffPost Entertainment in an earlier interview, he answered a casting call in his home city of Minneapolis to audition for film, and was among 700 hopeful actors who went out for the feature\\'s pirate roles. (Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed and Mahat M. Ali play the Somalis in the film.)

              "  'context': 'When it comes to mobile, bigger, of course, is not better. That was Jawbone\\'s thinking behind the Mini Jambox, the latest in Jawbone\\'s lineup of Bluetooth-enabled speakers, which went on sale on Wednesday for $179. The Mini Jambox is exactly what it sounds like: An even smaller version of the brick-like Jambox. Like its bigger and older siblings, the Jambox (also $179) and Big Jambox ($299), Mini Jambox is a rectangular speaker that connects to any device that has Bluetooth. Phones, tablets, music players or computers with Bluetooth can wirelessly send audio to the speaker, while devices without Bluetooth can connect to a 3.5 mm jack that allows for wired playback. At six inches long, one inch wide and just over two inches tall, the Mini Jambox is about half the width of the Jambox, which is already a pretty small speaker. To put that in perspective: it\\'s about the size of a pencil case, weighs as much as two smartphones, and easily fits into a small purse or the pocket of a pair of pants. The idea behind the Mini Jambox was to design a speaker that, like a phone or tablet, can be carried with you at all times, Travis Bogard, vice president of product management at Jawbone, said in an interview last week. \"It\\'s not rocket science to make a small speaker loud,\" said Bogard. \"That\\'s easy. [But] how do you make great sound in something small?\" He added: \"How can we make something that\\'s as accessible as the iPod, iPhone or iPad that you have with you at all times?\" The Mini Jambox is made for those moments -- at a park, at an impromptu gathering with a few friends, when you\\'re showing someone a viral video -- when your phone or tablet\\'s internal speaker isn\\'t going to cut it. It\\'s meant to be truly portable, and it\\'s not designed to replace your home stereo. Pairing the Mini Jambox with my devices was easy. Simply turn it on and and hold down the \"pairing button\" on the side of the speaker until you hear a voice that says \"Mini Jambox is in pairing mode -- waiting to pair with your device.\" Then, go to the Bluetooth settings in your phone, tablet or computer and select Mini Jambox. A voice alerts you seconds later when pairing is successful. I moved apartments over Labor Day weekend, so I spent hours listening to the Mini Jambox as I packed and unpacked boxes. I streamed Spotify, Pandora, NPR and Netflix from an iPhone, Moto X, and my computer, and the sound was, for the most part, very impressive. Despite its size, Mini Jambox was loud enough to be heard throughout my apartment. When listening to it outside one evening, I had to turn it down to make sure I wouldn\\'t disturb the neighbors. I would only occasionally hear distortion, when I was listening to music at the highest volume. The bass isn\\'t what you\\'d get with a larger speaker, but for a wireless speaker that you can carry in your pocket, it sounds pretty darn good. Jawbone is a company that prides itself on industrial design, and the Mini Jambox, constructed from a solid brick of aluminum that\\'s been chiseled away, is an attractive piece of hardware. And I inadvertently found out that it\\'s durable; the Mini Jambox sounded as good as ever after surviving a 4-foot fall onto concrete, suffering only a slightly dented corner. I never had to worry about the battery, which gives you 10 hours of playback on a single charge; Jawbone says that the Mini Jambox can be in standby mode for up to 75 hours. The Mini Jambox also has a speakerphone, so if it\\'s paired with a phone and it rings, you can answer without disconnecting the Bluetooth. (When someone calls, the audio stops and a voice reads out the phone number that\\'s calling, which isn\\'t actually that helpful because many of us no longer have phone numbers committed to memory.) But I wasn\\'t overly impressed with the way the speakerphone sounded -- and neither were the people on the other end -- so I would switch to the handset when someone called. The biggest negative of the Mini Jambox, however, is the steep price tag. At $179, it\\'s more expensive than some of the devices that stream music to it. You\\'re paying a premium for a beautifully designed portable speaker that\\'s also a fashion statement. But at the same time, it\\'s a lot to spend on a speaker that\\'s not meant to replace your home sound system. The Mini Jambox comes in nine anodized colors and goes on sale online on Wednesday. Jawbone hasn\\'t said when the speaker will begin to ship, but it will be available at a handful of retailers later this month.

This kind of perm isn’t going to be a repeat of Justin Timberlake’s curls from the early 2000s that looked rock hard from all the styling gel. Technology has improved, according to Diana Schmidtke, a professional men’s stylist with loads of experience. She told USA Today, \"It’s not your 1980s perms anymore, the science has technically advanced.\" Gone are the days when a perm left you with tight, stiff curls. \"Now they’re using very large perm rods, which give looser curls,\" Schmidtke said. Your hair will have more movement, giving it a more natural, face-framing look, rather than the over-the-top volume we used to see back in the day. So far, sounds pretty sexy. Of course, if you go to a trusted stylist, they’ll work with you to find out how to make the perm fit your face perfectly. It’s important to note, though, that Kit Harington, the actor responsible for bringing Jon Snow to life, has naturally curly hair. No perm needed. Schmidtke said, \"It should be duly noted that Kit Harington’s hair is naturally curly. In photoshoots or on the red carpet you see they actually relax his hair.\" So Kit isn’t exactly trying to set any trends here. He’s actually been quite outspoken about how he isn’t fond of being a sex object of sorts. \"I like to think of myself as more than a head of hair or a set of looks,\" he once said. I have to say, I think it’s pretty cool that men are feeling more and more comfortable to express themselves in this way. We used to think of perms as beauty routines reserved specifically for women, so it’s great to see everyone comfortable enough to ask for a perm if they feel like it. Besides, curls are sexy! And they’ve been considered sexy ever since the 19th century, when Romantic poets flaunted their wavy hair as they produced heart wrenching works about true love. So in a way, Jon Snow is bringing romance back in a modern way. Whether the perm fad actually picks up doesn’t matter to me, as long as Jon Snow keeps his locks — and all his other traits — exactly the way they are.

Credit Anne-Christine Poujoulat/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images An aircraft carrier can be a very handy tool, especially when trouble flares up far from a friendly military base. Just ask the Pentagon, which has 10 big Nimitz-class supercarriers that it uses around the world to protect air and sea lanes and to mount airstrikes. There’s generally at least one of them stationed near the Middle East at all times. So, as other countries join in military action against extremists in the world’s hot spots, can’t they send their own carriers into action? Well, they could if they had any. But, aside from the 10 American giants, there’s currently only one big carrier in the whole world that can handle such a job — and it doesn’t belong to Britain, Russia or even China. Though it is nuclear-powered, the Charles de Gaulle isn’t quite a supercarrier — it’s shorter and much lighter, and doesn’t pack the same punch. But neither does it rate down among the small escort carriers and helicopter carriers that a number of navies employ. It is considered a medium-size fleet carrier, and these days, it has that category practically to itself. Russia has the Admiral Kuznetsov, but that ship has been plagued with mechanical problems and doesn’t leave port often. A partially completed sister carrier was sold to China, but it has yet to complete trials. India has an older Russian castoff that rarely sails, and Brazil’s 50-year-old French-built fleet carrier, the São Paulo, is being refitted. Britain, which got out of the fleet carrier game years ago for cost reasons, is getting back in: A newly built carrier, which is larger than the Charles de Gaulle, is expected to be commissioned next year.

The Canadian newspaper reported quotes that were given to Globe MMA by Georges’ best friend and former cornerman Kristof Midoux, who verified that GSP is in camp right now. \"I will bring in sparring partners who will show him no deference,\" Midoux said. \"The best of the best, people who don’t know him.\" After defeating Conor McGregor at UFC 196 Nate Diaz went on retired fighter Chael Sonnen’s podcast to put forward his theory that GSP was in attendance at at the event to challenge McGregor in the event that the featherweight champ won. \"Yeah I heard (they were planning on having Conor call out GSP) but I put a big old hole in that shit. What did they think, that I’m some game they can play? I can’t be fucked with, I been in the game too long. They wanted to have this big old GSP vs. McGregor bullshit, with Georges sat in the front row at UFC 196, I don’t even wanna hear about that shit. Get the fuck outta here with that. What the fuck? I pissed off Conor McGregor, I pissed off GSP, but most of all I pissed off the UFC. Well guess what? LOL motherfuckers. Georges is full of shit, he’s a bully, he was going to fight this little Irish featherweight guy? He would have held him down, that’s a freak show fight man.\" However, Midoux put the McGregor or Diaz rumors to bed and laid out the list of fighters GSP would like to face in the event of a comeback. \"Of course he’s interested in avenging his performance versus Hendricks,\" Midoux said. \"He and I both know he did not lose that fight, but he did not exactly win it either. With that said, he’s more interested in Lawler since he holds the title and beat Hendricks.\" Bring it on! Report: Georges St-Pierre Reveals Who He Is Training Full-Time To Fight',\n",

              "  'context': 'Despite massive government, medical and individual efforts to win the war on obesity, 71 percent of Americans are overweight. The average adult is 24 pounds heavier today than in 1960. Our growing girth adds some US$200 billion per year to our health care expenditure, amounting to a severe health crisis. Drug research has not yielded a pill that helps people lose weight and keep it off. Traditional approaches such as diet and exercise can work short-term, but people almost inevitably regain the weight. Randomized controlled trials of weight loss surgery have shown some improvements in diabetes but not in mortality, cancer and cardiovascular disease. If there is ever to be a \"pill\" – a solution to weight – it will be changing the brain, particularly the primitive areas of the brain, the \"emotional brain\" or mammalian and reptilian brain. These areas house circuits that control stress and our stress-fueled emotions, thoughts and behaviors. These circuits can be rewired in humans so by changing them, we have a chance to address the root cause of stress-related problems, including obesity. While some overweight and obesity are caused by genetic make-up, more and more research is indicating that stress plays a big role in weight gain. Many people under stress turn to food for comfort. My colleagues and I set out to develop a neuroscience-based approach to weight management and dealing with the common excesses we all face, through emotional brain training. The idea was to use neuroscience-based tools to change the brain so that the whole range of common excesses would fade. The method has shown promising results. The emotional brain is command central for weight and common excesses. It includes the fear, reward and starvation centers. When that brain is in stress, all three centers promote overeating and weight gain. We have strong drives to do exactly what we know we shouldn’t do. We can’t help it! Our emotional brain is in stress. That stress ramps up the reward value of food, increases hunger for carbohydrates and decreases metabolic rate, almost ensuring weight gain. The stress-obesity link has been well-documented. Our thinking brain (neocortex) goes off line, and the extremes of our emotional brain calls the shots. To Take Care Of Your Body, Take Care Of Your Brain Levels of stress. via www.shutterstock.com The first step in taking control of our weight is to destress the emotional brain. In emotional brain training (EBT), we release stress by checking in several times throughout the day, identifying our level of stress and using the technique for that stress level to \"spiral up\" to a state of well-being. There are five levels of stress and five tools. To get an idea of how they work, take a few breaths, check in with yourself and identify your stress level. Then use the tools for that level of stress to reduce your stress rapidly. 1. Compassion Tool (Stress Level 1 - Very Low Stress) Say to yourself, \"Feel compassion for myself,\" then wait for a wave of compassion to flow through your body. Next say, \"Feel compassion for others,\" and feel a slight wave of warmth. Last, say, \"Feel compassion for all living beings.\" 2. Feelings Tool (Stress Level 2 - Low Stress) Ask yourself, \"How do I feel?\" Often, three feelings bubble up, but wait long enough so that one feeling is the strongest. That’s the one! Next ask yourself, \"What do I need?\" and, finally, \"Do I need support?\" 3. Flow Tool (Stress Level 3 - A Little Stress) Say the words: \"I feel angry that ...\" and watch what words arrive in your mind to complete the sentence. State the sentence again, for seven more feelings: sad, afraid, guilty, grateful, happy, secure and proud. Notice the glow in your body and how your stress is gone. Why? When we feel our negative feelings, they fade. We are no longer in peril and the brain naturally focuses on positive feelings that give us the energy to move forward and do good things in our life. 4. Cycle Tool (Stress Level 4 - High Stress) Start by stating what is bothering you (don’t hold back!), then protest that stress by saying \"I feel angry that ... I can’t stand it that ... I hate it that ... .\" and each time watch what words arrive in your mind. This can unlock the circuit so that you can change at a deeper level. Pause and take a few deep breaths, then say the words: \"I feel sad that ... I feel afraid that ... I feel guilty that ...\" and watch what words arrive in your mind to complete each sentence. Next support yourself, and say, \"OF COURSE I could do that (such as overeat) because my unreasonable expectation is ... \" and again wait for words to bubble up from your unconscious mind, such as: \"I get my safety from overeating.\" That’s just an old glitch of a memory that needs updating. So, update it! Say the opposite expectation (such as \"I cannot get my safety from food ... I can get my safety from connecting to myself\"). As you stated this when the circuit was freshly unlocked, the circuit can change into the expectation of your choosing. As the new expectation becomes dominant, the emotional drives for various excesses (including food) can begin to fade so that changing behavior becomes easier. 5. Damage Control Tool (Stress Level 5 - Very High Stress) When we’re that stressed, we need to be held and comforted. Sometimes just rocking in your chair or breathing deeply helps. Also, you can say calming words repeatedly: \"Do not judge. Minimize harm. Know it will pass. After all, it’s just stress and it will fade.\" Survival Circuits Activate Strong Emotional Drives To Overeat Once you’ve started releasing stress from your emotional brain, chances are you’ll notice that you still get triggered sometimes. You might even blame yourself for that late night binge or that mindless eating. Actually, it’s just a survival circuit. They are encoded when we are stressed and reach for food to cope. The brain remembers that food \"saved us\" from stress, so it encodes an expectation, such as \"I get my safety from food.\" That circuit can be replayed for a lifetime, fueling maladaptive eating. Research now shows that these survival circuits can be rewired and we do that in EBT. In fact, they can only be rewired when we are stressed. Only then does the circuit unlock and make change more lasting. When stressed and craving food, the EBT user reaches for a tool rather than for the food and uses it to stop the craving and change the circuit. The drive to overeat fades. The Last Step: Keeping The Weight Off Keeping weight off is hard but it may be easier if we improve the brain’s emotional setpoint. Often a setpoint in stress is encoded from adverse experiences early in life and causes chronic stress overload in the emotional brain, a set up for weight regain. The solution is to move up the emotional setpoint, so we get the emotional brain out of chronic stress, which is why the EBT program is aimed at raising the setpoint, so participants are more resilient to new stresses, less likely to regain the weight they have lost and, most of all, to experience more joy in their daily lives.

Wendy\\'s CEO Emil Brolick says it\\'s because consumers are strapped for cash. On an earnings call last year, Brolick pointed to data showing that median disposable household income in the US has remained relatively flat over the last two decades. \"There are a lot of consumers out there who are simply heavy users of quick-serve restaurants, who don\\'t have a lot of disposable income, and because they\\'re using restaurants frequently, price and value is something that is important to them,\" Brolick said. \" And we see that as something will be important for a long time to come, and we just have to evolve our offering to be more relevant to the specific needs that they have.\" McDonald\\'s found out the hard way just how important value menus are to its customers. The burger chain upset many customers two years ago when it reformulated the Dollar Menu by axing the $1 price ceiling and turning it into the \"Dollar Menu and More\" with items that cost up to $5. McDonald\\'s CEO Steve Easterbrook said axing that menu was a major driver behind McDonald\\'s declining sales over the last couple years.

              "  'context': 'This piece comes to us courtesy of EdSource, where it was originally published. California, home to the largest number of American Indians in the country, is for the third time considering legislation that would end the use of \"Redskins\" as a school team name or mascot. If the legislation passes and is signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, California would become the first state in the nation to ban the use of \"Redskins\" as a team name or mascot in public schools, according to the Washington, D.C.-based National Congress of American Indians, founded in 1944. Many Native Americans consider the term a racial slur. The bill is the latest effort in a more than 50-year national campaign by Native Americans to remove race-based team names from schools and sports groups. In California, proponents of the ban have cited peer-reviewed studies by researchers at the University of Arizona, Stanford University and the University of Michigan that found American Indian youth who were exposed to Native American mascots and stereotypical imagery reported a diminished sense of what they could achieve academically. Cindy La Marr, executive director of the Sacramento-based nonprofit organization Capitol Area Indian Resources, said the harm of stereotypical racial mascots is compounded because there is a widespread lack of knowledge about the modern-day lives of Native Americans or their history. That history, documented by the California Research Bureau in a 2002 report, includes state-funded military expeditions against the Indians in the 1850s and an 1850 law allowing a white person to obtain Indian children for indenture. \"It’s time that we as a state take a stand against racial slurs used in our public schools,\" said state Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Salinas, author of Assembly Bill 30, known as the California Racial Mascots Act. The bill unanimously passed the Assembly Education Committee last month and is heading for a hearing before the Assembly Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports, Tourism and Internet Media on April 21. Just four California schools continue to use \"Redskins\" as a team name and mascot: Calaveras High School in Calaveras County, Chowchilla Union High School in Madera County, Gustine High School in Merced County and Tulare Union High School in Tulare County. \"We love our mascot,\" said Ron Seals, superintendent of Chowchilla Union High School District. The school mascot is an Indian chief known as \"Reddy Redskin,\" he said. \"I’m not disputing the fact that it’s offensive to some, but I’m not calling you a Redskin,\" he said. \"We call ourselves Redskins.\" \"The name and the mascot have been a source of pride at the high school for 60 or 70 years,\" said Joseph Oliveira Jr., a former first baseman for the Gustine High baseball team and a member of the Gustine City Council, which officially opposes the effort to remove the name. \"It’s never been thought of as being a slur. We are the Redskins. We are the mighty Redskins. The town loves the nickname and to lose it now will be devastating.\" Dahkota Kicking Bear Brown, 16, a Miwok Indian and a junior at Argonaut High School in Jackson, told a different story at a hearing before the Assembly Education Committee. As a sophomore lineman for the Argonaut football team, Brown said he dreaded game day against the Calaveras High School \"Redskins\" because it included war cries from fans, sports announcers announcing \"a wild party of Redskins!\" and even his own friends shouting \"Kill the Redskins! Send them on the Trail of Tears!\" He recalled his cousin crying after a football game during which a female student dressed up as \"Pocahottie\" while other students pretended to prepare to burn her at the stake. \"I do not blame those students, the school or staff for any of these things,\" Brown said in an email interview. \"I do not think they knew better or considered what they were doing as wrong.\" But, he said, \"I will blame people for hearing the facts and then not caring enough to stop the harm.\" The California Racial Mascots Act would require California schools to phase out \"Redskins\" as a team name and mascot by Jan. 1, 2019. Similar legislation failed to pass the state Legislature in 2002, but did win approval in 2003, only to be vetoed by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who said it was up to local communities to decide on team names and mascots. Schools have a responsibility to ensure that every student feels respected, said Eric Stegman, a policy analyst at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C.-based nonpartisan policy institute, and co-author of a report about the impact of Native American mascots on American Indian youth. \"We shouldn’t be placing the sentimentality of a letterman’s jacket or jersey above the interest of success for any student,\" he said. In 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights stated that the use of Native American images and names by non-Native schools \"has the potential to create a racially hostile educational environment.\" The American Psychological Association said in 2005 that Native American team names and mascots create \"an unwelcoming and even hostile school environment\" for American Indian students.

In the grocery store, she talks about the foods she sees and sniffs. \"Sometimes, people look at you like you\\'re a crazy person when you\\'re like, \\'I\\'m feeeeeeling this pepper. It\\'s red. It\\'s waxy,\\'\" laughed the 33-year-old school counselor, who lives in Miami with her husband and their 1-year-old daughter. But the exercises, which Fisch\\'s therapist recommended, are beginning to provide relief from the anxiety she has battled for the better part of a decade -- staying up nights, fretting: How am I going to go to work for nine hours and take care of the baby? When am I going to have time to go to the grocery store? Increasingly, through her daily practice of meditation, Fisch is able to exert some control over those thoughts, recognizing them when they arise, and calmly telling them to go away. \"It\\'s not the traditional idea of meditation of, I\\'m sitting cross-legged on the floor, I clear my mind and I\\'m saying \\'Om\\' for 20 minutes,\" Fisch said. \"When you work full-time, and you have a kid, you\\'re like, \\'Seriously? I don\\'t even have 20 minutes to work out. And I\\'m supposed to clear my mind?\\'\" Whitney Fisch says mindfulness has helped her deal with her anxiety and connect with her daughter. Women are increasingly asking similar versions of those questions, as the ancient practice of meditation becomes more and more mainstream. The possibility that something so seemingly simple could help slash stress and affect broader markers of health is a tantalizing one, particularly at a time when 68 percent of women in the United States say that managing their stress is very important to them, but only 34 percent feel they\\'re succeeding. Still, it\\'s one thing to acknowledge meditation\\'s benefits, and another to make time for it on a daily basis amid the demands of work and family life. And so more women are asking how and when exactly this is supposed to happen. \"I think a lot of women have no idea where to begin,\" admitted Gabrielle Bernstein, author of May Cause Miracles, a guidebook offering small changes women can make day-to-day to promote happiness. \"I think with something as simple as Googling \\'guided meditation\\' you can get yourself there, or Googling \\'how to meditate.\\'\" Indeed, while more formal, group study has benefits, it\\'s not necessary, echoed Sharon Salzberg, cofounder of the Insight Meditation Society and author of Real Happiness, The Power of Meditation: A 28-Day Program. Women can turn to meditation books, tapes, classes, friends -- or any combination thereof that they feel connected or drawn to, she said. As more people begin to consider meditation as a way to bring balance and calm to their lives, Salzberg says the most important thing is to approach it not as something intimidating and exotic, but as an accessible, flexible practice that can fit into even the busiest life. \"People tend to have such a strong tendency to punish themselves, and think, \\'Oh, I\\'m not doing this right, because I\\'m not sitting here in bliss every single moment\\' ... or \\'I failed at this, because I couldn\\'t stop any thinking from happening.\\' It\\'s those unrealistic expectations that really thwart us.\" One of the strongest arguments for meditation is that it doesn\\'t need to be time-consuming. Bernstein, for example, believes just 60 seconds of focused stillness a day can produce profound changes in women\\'s lives -- breathing in for five seconds, holding their breath for five seconds, and exhaling for five seconds. Salzberg recommends beginners meditate three times a week for five to 15 minutes, and work up to 20 minutes daily if possible, but she believes that what matters most is consistency. That\\'s a lesson Jillian Amodio, 23, a prolific freelance writer and stay-at-home mother with a 2-year-old daughter, took some time to learn. At 19, she was diagnosed with endometriosis -- a painful condition that occurs when the tissue that lines a woman\\'s uterus grows elsewhere in her body. Amodio went so far as to have menopause temporarily induced, which relieved her pain for more than a year before it returned. She then began researching \"alternative healing\" and took up a home yoga and meditation routine, piecing together elements from different videos and DVDs. (HuffPost is not advocating this approach, it is what Amodio tried.) Though she believes the practice has all but eliminated her pain, it took her several months to fight the sense that it was just another thing she was failing at. \"I was just concentrating on the idea of, \\'If I\\'m going to do this right, I need to find an hour in my day, I need to find an hour in my day,\\'\" Amodio said. \"Some days, I would sit down and I\\'d start to do it, and I\\'d get five minutes in and I\\'d hear the baby crying on the monitor; some days, I\\'d sit down and say, \\'I\\'m going to do my hour,\\' and I\\'d think, but I\\'m so tired, I just want to sleep.\" But something clicked when she took a step back and asked herself, \"What is the purpose of this meditation? It\\'s not to get an hour in. It\\'s to get relaxed, and to re-center myself.\" Now, Amodio meditates daily after putting her daughter down for a late afternoon nap. She sits on a yoga mat or pillow in her living room with the windows thrown open to let in air and light, or with the blinds drawn, to create a sense of cozy calm. Other days, she goes out to the back deck of the Maryland home she shares with her husband. It faces the water, so she can sit and feel the breeze. \"Even if it\\'s just 10 minutes of meditation a day,\" she said, \"that\\'s my me-time.\" Jillian Amodio now averages around 20 minutes of meditation daily, despite being a busy freelancer and mom.

It’s hard to resist late-night cravings, but try to limit your bedtime nosh to 100 or 200 calories, 300 calories tops, said Isabel Maples, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and choose nutrient-rich items that may be lacking in your diet, like fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy foods, whole grains or nuts, \"to really make those calories count.\" (Seafood and beans are other good options, but not particularly appealing before bed.) Keep in mind that snacking contributes to weight gain, and studies have found that nearly one-quarter of the calories we eat come from snacks. A banana, apple or other fresh fruit, a small portion of low-fat cottage cheese or plain yogurt with sliced fruit, or oatmeal or some other high-fiber cereal with skim milk were frequent suggestions made by experts interviewed for this article. Other suggestions included raw veggie sticks, a couple of whole grain crackers with a small slice of cheese, a handful of almonds or other nuts, or celery sticks spread with a tablespoon or two of peanut butter or almond butter (measure the nuts and butters — don’t eat them straight out of the container). Combining carbohydrates with protein produces a filling, sating feeling, even from a small snack, Ms. Maples said. If you’re in the mood for something salty and crunchy, air-popped popcorn may fit the bill, suggested Laura Smith, a product manager for Weight Watchers. It’s important to note that many people become hungry at night because \"they eat too little during the day, and then by the time they get home, they can’t stop, because they have built up a huge reservoir of starving inside,\" said Susan B. Roberts, a senior scientist and professor at the U.S.D.A. Nutrition Center at Tufts University, and founder of the online iDiet weight management program. For others, she said, snacking before bed may just be a bad habit. Also ask yourself: Are you really hungry? People often mistake thirst for hunger. Try drinking more throughout the day, and having more water or carbonated water with dinner. Before bed, try a glass of low-fat milk, hot or cold, noncaffeinated tea or, best of all, plain old water. \"Drinking water is clearly the least harmful item to have before bed,\" said Barry Popkin, a professor at the U.N.C.

After a long discussion about her work on the Disney movie (more on that in a bit), we concluded the chat talking about Jurassic World 2 and director J.A. Bayona taking the helm. Bryce Dallas Howard mentioned that she's been communicating with the filmmaker, and that she was actually going to be seeing Jurassic World director/producer Colin Trevorrow later that day, but also noted that it's weird talking about the sequel because of the restrictions on communication. She explained, Whenever I have the chance to be around that group, that crew I like get information. [laughter] J.A.'s over in Europe right now, so I haven't seen him in person. I'm sure he wouldn't... because you know what, the emailing and texting, you can't go on record. You can't write anything down, commit to anything in writing. So, tonight I'll just be like, 'Can you verbally explain to me what's happening?' But we'll shoot it next year. Studios and filmmakers are constantly looking for ways to prevent details about their upcoming projects leaking to the public, and one could see this being a very effective way. Sure, one can imagine that there's a risk of some material getting scrambled if stuff isn't being written down, but not putting anything in texts, emails or memos means that nobody is going to see material they aren't going to see (and at the most extreme level, it's safe from hackers). Jurassic World 2 has been seriously in the works for a while now, with J.A. Bayona coming aboard about four months ago. As Bryce Dallas Howard mentioned, the plan is to start filming next year, with Universal Pictures having put a flag in a June 22, 2018 release date. Howard will reprise her role as Claire Dearing, and Chris Pratt will be back as Owen Grady, and while Colin Trevorrow told us that a big theme of the movie will be the proliferation of dinosaurs, not much is known beyond that.

              "  'context': 'Apple’s brand new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus finally became a reality last week and as is always the case, people were surprised even though every single major detail had already been revealed. Leaks just never seem to do an adequate job of painting a complete picture when it comes to Apple’s new iPhones. While some tech blogs saw the similar design and immediately assumed the new iPhones would be boring, we now know that’s simply not the case. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are two of the sleekest smartphones we’ve ever seen, and they also just so happen to be the fastest and most powerful handsets ever Needless to say, getting the model you want on launch day will be no easy task — but we do have some good news for you. Apple’s new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were made available for preorder this past Friday and within just a few minutes, several models were already sold out. People generally kept their cool compared to previous years, but there are definitely thousands upon thousands of Apple fans out there upset that they weren’t able to preorder the iPhone they wanted for launch day delivery. In fact, considering how quickly release day inventory of just about every iPhone 7 Plus model sold out, it’s pretty safe to say that Apple has some serious supply constraints to contend with this year. This is likely one of several reasons Apple will not announce opening-weekend sales next week. Unless you woke up in the middle of the night to preorder the iPhone 7 Plus, odds are very good that you didn’t get the model you wanted. In fact, launch-day inventory of several smaller iPhone 7 models has sold out as well, which means new preorders won’t be delivered this coming Friday in many cases. But don’t worry, because there are still ways for you to get your hands on the new iPhone 7 want this coming Friday. In a nutshell, you have two options. Apple Stores — especially larger, high-traffic stores — will have plenty of inventory on hand for people who didn’t preorder a new phone. The problem, of course, is that Apple Stores are the first stop for most Apple fans on iPhone release day. If you’re willing to head out early though, this is your best bet because Apple Stores always receive the most new iPhone units on release day. The catch is that everyone knows this, so you’ll have to head out very early in the morning if you want to have any hope of getting a more popular iPhone model, such as anything in Jet Black. But there’s also another option. As noted by a former AT&T sales associate who is currently a Verizon sales associate, carrier stores often get a decent amount of inventory on launch day. While most people head to the Apple Store to try to score a new iPhone, you could have a much easier time going to a carrier store. You should still plan to head out early, but you might be surprised at how easy it is to score a new iPhone compared to going to an Apple Store. \"Authorized retailers for your carrier typically get 5-6 new iPhones on launch day,\" Reddit user shashmalash wrote in a post . \"The dirty little secret though, is these retailers will get to the end of day and still have open iPhones to sell because most people are going to Apple and corporate carrier stores to get their iPhone without realizing there is barely a line at your local retailer.\" He continued, \"Worked at an AT&T retailer for 2 years and a Verizon retailer for the last 2 years and we ALWAYS have open iPhones to sell at the end of launch day so if you don’t have a preorder, just try to hit up your local retailer and you’ll probably walk out with an iPhone 7!\" A few other retail associates chimed in as well, but the takeaway is that even if you didn’t manage to secure the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus you wanted when you tried to preorder one, there’s still hope. iPhone 7 Plus Jet Black: How to find the iPhone 7 you want at launch ...',\n",

              "  'context': 'An officer-involved shooting that took place over the weekend in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has drawn heavy criticism from the usual suspects in the Black Lives Matter movement and their allies in the liberal media. Video of the incident filmed from a helicopter overhead appeared to some to show a 40-year-old unarmed black man named Terence Crutcher with his hands over his head being shot and killed by white police officer Betty Shelby, seemingly confirming the narrative that police routinely use excessive force and deadly violence against black men who pose no threat to them. But according to Tulsa World, evidence was discovered in Crutcher’s vehicle that, while unknown to the officers on the scene at the time, could nevertheless explain some of the man’s behavior that led to the officer feeling compelled to fire her weapon. Inside the vehicle beside which Crutcher was shot and killed was discovered a vial of PCP, a highly dangerous drug that can often create a psychopathic and violent state of mind in its users. In fact, there were numerous anecdotal accounts of individuals on PCP who become nearly impervious to pain, including gunshots, continuing to attack police officers and innocent bystanders alike even as they are being shot repeatedly in locations that would instantly drop an ordinary non-drug using suspect. Another matter that could very well help explain Crutcher’s attitude and actions during the incident was that he had a lengthy criminal rap sheet, including several counts of resisting arrest and prior drug convictions for which he had served time. It is also noteworthy that Crutcher had a warrant out for his arrest related to previous charges of resisting arrest and drug use, so he could have made clear through his words and attitude that he had no intention of peacefully being arrested or returning to prison. All of this is evidence that could conceivably corroborate the view of the officer on the scene who reportedly stated Crutcher looked \"like a bad dude\" who \"could be on something.\" It was expected that the medical examiner’s office will release a toxicology report detailing whether Crutcher had the powerful drug in his system at the time of the incident, along with the rest of the broader autopsy report.

According to data provided by Placed , a consumer habits data service provider that monitors behavior of more than 150,000 American consumers at 150 million locations daily, the most popular brands are primarily in the fast-food, discount retail and pharmacy segments. Half of the most visited retailers are fast-food chains. Placed founder and CEO David Shim explained that while you don’t need household supplies every day, \"three times a day or more you need to eat, so there’s a higher propensity to visit these types of businesses.\" The lower price per transaction at fast-food chains compared to other retailers also helps them to attract consumers, Shim noted. Consumers also regularly shop at the country’s biggest drugstore chains and big-box retailers. In addition to selling widely purchased goods, these retailers have the most locations in the country. Walgreens, 7-Eleven and CVS Caremark all had more than 7,000 U.S. locations in 2012, among the most stores nationwide. Food chains were even more numerous. Subway, McDonald’s and Starbucks were all among the top five companies by store count, each with well over 14,000 U.S. locations in 2012. Many of the most popular stores with consumers tended to have large advertising budgets. According to Shim, \"From our perspective, [advertising] dollars do matter in terms of driving traffic in the store.\" In fact, seven of the 10 most popular stores were among the top-spenders on advertising nationwide in 2011 and 2012, according to Advertising Age, a magazine providing market and industry data. Placed found that consumers’ habits differed considerably by gender and income level. \"Fast food typically tends to skew more men than women,\" Shim said. In contrast, retail shoppers skew female. While men and women were equally likely to go to Starbucks, shoppers at Target were 16% more likely to be women, and Taco Bell diners were 13% more likely to be men. Americans making more than $100,000 per year were on the whole were more likely to shop at big-box retailers and drugstores than those making between $25,000 and $100,000. On the other hand, consumers making less than $25,000, were more likely to eat at three of the most popular fast food restaurants — Burger King, McDonald’s and Taco Bell — than those making more than $100,000. To determine the nation’s most popular stores, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from location analytics company Placed. Placed calculated the percentage of Americans who visited various stores in March 2014. The group also provided demographic and socioeconomic data on customers for various retailers and restaurants . These are indexed to a base of 100, representing the average American consumer. We also reviewed 2012 U.S. sales and store count data from the National Retail Federation’s Stores.org, as well as advertising expenditure figures from AdAge covering 2011 and 2012. These are America’s most popular stores: 1. Walmart > Index score, women: 106 > Index score, men: 93 > Store count: 4,570 > One-year stock-price change : -0.9% > Store category : Department store Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is far and away the nation’s largest retailer, with nearly $329 billion in U.S. retail sales in 2012. Unlike many other popular destinations, Americans earning more than $100,000 a year were far less likely to visit Walmart than the average American. Walmart continues to grow, having increased its U.S. store count 3.3% to 4,570 locations in 2012. Walmart spent $1.8 billion on advertising in 2012, effectively unchanged from the year before, but still more than all but a handful of companies. 2. McDonald’s > Index score, women : 97 > Index score, men : 103 > Store count: 14,146 > One-year stock-price change : -0.6% > Store category : Restaurant McDonald’s was by far the most visited fast- food restaurant in the nation in March. Although McDonald’s remains hugely popular, its U.S. same-store sales declined by 1.7% this quarter from the same quarter the year before, with reports citing slowing service times and heightened competition. Among the company’s plans to draw diners back to its stores is the recent unveiling of the newly redesigned Ronald McDonald, which attempts to make the icon more contemporary and less clown-like. Like several other popular stores, McDonald’s Corp. has among the nation’s largest advertising budgets, spending $1.4 billion on ads in 2012, up 4.2% from a year before. 3. Subway > Index score, women: 95 > Index score, men : 105 > Store count: 25,900 > One-year stock-price chang e: N/A > Store category: Restaurant Among restaurants, Subway trails only McDonald’s in popularity. While more Americans visit the Golden Arches, by the end of 2010 Subway actually passed McDonald’s in the number of stores globally, at 33,749. Subway’s expansion continued in 2012, with the number of stores growing 3.5% that year, among the biggest increases nationwide among major chains. Subway spent nearly $545 million on advertising in 2012, up 6.1% from the year before, and more than most other U.S. companies. 4. Starbucks > Index score, women: 100 > Index score, men : 100 > Store count: 11,128 > One-year stock-price change : +18.2% > Store category : Restaurant Starbucks Corp. has dominated U.S. coffee sales for years. Its sales have generally continued to grow since its initial public offering in the early 1990s. The coffee chain has changed its product lineup in recent years, introducing a range of foods, including a larger breakfast and lunch menu. The stores also continue to attract coffee drinkers with its free Wi-Fi. Unlike many other popular stores, Starbucks is less segmented by gender or age. As David Shim explains, \"Everyone wants coffee.\" However, unlike others in the food sector, shoppers making more than $100,000 were far more likely — 58% — to buy cup of coffee at Starbucks than those making less than $25,000. 5. Walgreens > Index score, women: 105 > Index score, men : 94 > Store count: 7,821 > One-year stock-price change : +35.9% > Store category : Department store As with many retailers, Walgreens was more popular among women than men. Women were 11% more likely to visit Walgreens than men. The company expanded faster than many others recently, with the number of Walgreens locations growing by 2.2% between 2011 and 2012. Walgreen Co. — the largest pharmacy operator in the nation — was fined $80 million by the Food and Drug Administration last year for failing to properly control distribution of dangerous drugs.

He was a student with a 200-page undergraduate law thesis to turn in—one he is now accused of plagiarizing. One of Mexico’s top investigative journalists, Carmen Aristegui, published an article Sunday that says Peña Nieto lifted nearly one-third of his thesis. A group of academics reviewed all 682 paragraphs of the piece, titled \"Mexican Presidentialism and Alvaro Obregon,\" and found Peña Nieto plagiarized 197 paragraphs from 10 authors, and incorrectly cited them in 57 more. In 20 of these instances, he lifted sentences word-for-word, including from a book written by a former president. Here are examples, which Aristegui provided in her article. Even if you don’t read Spanish, you can at least see all the words are the same. Aristegui’s report comes at a time when the Mexican public is calling for a corruption investigation of the president, and when murders are rising in the country for the first time since he took office in 2012. Peña Nieto has already faced media ridicule for not being the country’s smartest president during his presidential campaign in 2011, he failed to name a single book that had influenced his life, except the Bible. The moment was especially notable because it happened while he gave a speech at an international book festival. He then confused the name of two authors, one of whom was well-known historian Enrique Krauze—an author Peña Nieto is now accused of plagiarizing. Aristegui was one of the country’s most famous radio personalities until she lost her job last year after publishing a critical investigation on Peña Nieto and his wife. At the time, Aristegui worked at a popular Mexico City radio station, where she and a team of reporters uncovered the story of a mansion built for Peña Nieto’s wife by a company that received hundreds of millions of dollars in government contracts. The report implied a conflict of interest at best, and outright corruption at worst. Aristegui lost her job soon after the news broke, which raised suspicion that she’d been fired because of pressure from the Mexican government. But the radio station said it dismissed her because of her connection to a site called Mexicoleaks, a platform that allows people to submit complaints of government corruption that journalists could potentially investigate.

              "  'context': 'Unable to make babies on their own, more than two dozen couples went to a top-flight fertility clinic in the Netherlands for help. But the clinic has announced it may have been leaving old sperm on its tools for more than a year — and now those couples face the prospect of raising a stranger\\'s biological child. \"The chance is small, but cannot be ruled out\" that women were \"fertilized by sperm cells from a man other than the intended father,\" officials at the University Medical Center in Utrecht said in a statement this week. It\\'s not the first mass case of artificial insemination potentially gone awry, though most high-profile bungles have mixed up anonymous donors. In this case, the medical center said that it was trying to contact 26 men and women — half of whom already have or are expecting a baby — for 26 very difficult conversations. \"The supervisory board regrets having to burden the couples involved with the news,\" the statement said. The New York Times reported that the women were contacted after the statement\\'s release and were offered DNA tests. The patients didn\\'t use the most common method of in vitro fertilization, in which egg and sperm are combined in a petri dish. Rather, they used a newer procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection, which can help men with scant or sluggish sperm by shooting it directly into an egg cell. A technician had just finished an injection in November, a hospital spokesman told the Times, when she discovered sperm from a previous patient on the end of the syringe. The syringe tips are disposable, the Times reported, so the hospital suspects the rogue cell hitched a ride on a rubber bulb that wasn\\'t supposed to be attached to the device. The clinic had been improperly using those bulbs since April of the previous year. Some of those couples now have a child — the oldest might be a year old, if the first patient conceived right away. Other women treated during that period are pregnant, according to the hospital. And 13 couples have frozen embryos at the clinic, which they must now decide whether they want to replace. Meanwhile, the hospital is trying to figure out if any stray sperm actually managed to make a baby. It\\'s also unknown how many contaminant sperm cells from how many men may have been used on patients. \"Everything will be done to provide clarity for everyone as soon as possible,\" the statement said. David Keefe, who chairs New York University\\'s department of obstetrics and gynecology, said his own clinic is hesitant to perform the injections, unless absolutely necessary. The procedure was considered risky by many doctors until a few years ago — mostly because it was new. Now that it\\'s been tested, Keefe said, it tends to be overused by patients in a hurry to have a child. \"This is one of many examples where it can go awry,\" he told The Washington Post. \"It\\'s very sobering that one of the very best fertility centers in the most regulated country in the world still had risk.\" But he said that he suspected Utrecht was simply being cautious in halting the procedure and announcing its error. Technicians usually pick up a single sperm cell at a time in a syringe, Keefe said. \"The thought that one of them would have gotten up into the micro-manipulator is interesting, but I think theoretical. There aren\\'t that many sperm to get up there.\" \"I suspect they\\'re going to find out every one of those kids is from the right father,\" he said. Keefe was at odds with his friend and colleague at New York University: Arthur Caplan, who founded NYU\\'s bioethics division and heads its medical ethics department. \"If there was contamination from a healthy donor, versus a male making barely any sperm . . . then the odds of the baby coming from contaminant sperm is like 100,000 to 1,\" Caplan said. And where Keefe described the Netherlands\\' fertility clinics as the very strictest in a highly regulated industry, Caplan has argued that the fertility industry isn\\'t watched closely enough. Accidents are bound to happen, he said, and they often do. But he called the Utrecht case \"very unusual.\" He recalled many one-off and obvious mishaps — like a couple who sued a Chicago-area clinic, claiming they ordered sperm from a white donor but ended up with mixed-race child. Caplan remembered cases of mass malfeasance, too, like an Indiana doctor accused of impregnating at least eight patients with his own sperm. But those cases involved anonymous sperm banks. The Utrecht mishap could be \"deeply troubling to the male donor, because they were looking for their own biological child,\" he said. \"Most people would say, what choice do you have? You have to accept a child that was born in error.\" On the other hand, Caplan wondered what Utrecht will do to satisfy the unwitting source or sources of the errant sperm. \"What about the man or men? Does he find out?\" he said. \"Does he have 26 children now?\" Dozens of couples went to a top fertility clinic. It may have used the wrong sperm.',\n",

One of the questions Pew asks to gauge how seriously people are taking their identity politics these days is how upset would you be if an immediate family member—say, a child or a sibling—married someone outside of your identity parameters. The good news: Americans are okay with their family members marrying someone who isn\\'t in their \"tribe.\" There are all different kinds of tribes, of course. When it came, for instance, to the question of how you\\'d feel if your family member married someone with a different party affiliation, the vast majority of Americans responded that they\\'d feel either \"happy\" or that it \"doesn\\'t matter.\" Even for strict partisans, this was mostly true. Strong conservatives approved of a family member marrying a Democrat 70 percent of the time and strong liberals approved of marrying a Republican 78 percent of the time. Similar numbers turned up for identity markers like \"gun ownership\" or \"went to college,\" with most people being indifferent to these factors when it comes to bringing new people to family holiday dinners. Other good news is that opposition to interracial marriage, at least overt opposition, is also fairly low, with only 11 percent of Americans balking at the idea of a new family member of a different race. (How likely you are to bothered by racial mixing rose with levels of conservatism, with only one percent of strong liberals opposing interracial marriage and 23 percent of strong conservatives doing so.) And Americans are even more welcoming to foreigners, with only 7 percent of respondents opposing marriage to someone born and raised outside of the U.S. There\\'s one group, however, that continues to cause fear and loathing across the land: atheists.

              "  'context': 'For some unpleasant things in life, it seems to be a point of pride to declare that you have it the very worst. People one-up their friends on who had the most embarrassing drunken weekend, argue that their mother-in-law horror story is the most outrageous, or insist that their city has with the worst traffic. It makes us remember that painful encounters and daily nuisances are shared experiences—making a competition out of it brings a bit of comfort. So if you are a resident of Louisville, Kentucky, congratulations: The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has awarded your city the dubious honor of having the worst allergies in the United States this spring. As we sneeze and sniffle our way through this year’s long spring allergy season—likely to last through June in most places in the country, according to the AAFA—it seems as fine a time as any for Louisvillians to enjoy your honor (as best you can). If you do not live in Louisville, don’t feel too defeated. The city’s position at the top of the list is tenuous, and it may very well be lost next year. The AAFA’s rankings, which are ordered by a formula taking into account pollen levels, allergy medication used, and number of allergists, change from year to year. East Coasters like to complain about allergies a lot, but their suffering is actually mild compared to that of folks in some inland parts of the United States. New Yorkers, Bostonians, and Washingtonians may believe that the country revolves around them, which has somehow convinced them that they must also be at the epicenter of massive swirls of pollen. But actually, if you live in Tennessee, Kansas, or Ohio, you have a much better shot at bragging rights next spring; cities in these states regularly make the top 10 worst places for spring allergies. This year Memphis, Tennessee, came in second, followed by Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Oklahoma City; and Jackson, Mississippi. Knoxville, Tennessee, occupied the top spot for three years in a row, from 2009 to 2011. On the whole, spring allergies are worse in the southern and eastern United States than the north and west, says James Sublett of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, because there are more deciduous trees simultaneously releasing pollen on those sides of the country. There are slightly more allergy-inducing species of trees in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and South (25) compared to the West and Midwest (23). Their golden flowery powder is permeating the air, floating into your nostrils, and causing your immune system to think you are under attack. (It’s even worse if you’re middle-aged.) Geographic features aid in making some places traps for pollen. Louisville, for example, is in a river valley, ensuring that the city will be enveloped each year by the fine particulates its lush surrounding flora release to breed. The Cumberland Mountains to the northwest and Smoky Mountains to the southeast guard Knoxville, preventing allergy-causing pollens from its local trees (elm, hazelnut, willow, walnut, and mulberry, among others) from escaping. But of course, spring is not the only time for allergies. Anyone in Texas knows that from December to February, collective misery ensues as people suffer from bouts of \"cedar fever.\" (Cedar inspires such hatred in Texas that a group called \"People Against Cedar\" denounces the trees as \"a plague.\") And in autumn, weeds and grasses throughout the country will bring new dustings of stuff to make your nose run.

But we buy them anyway because pine nuts make it worth it when we add them to our cooking — just think of all that summer pesto We never put much thought into pine nuts, except to be sure to keep them in stock when we had bunches of summer basil to work with. But just recently we were informed by a colleague as to where pine nuts came from — an adorable origin it turns out — and we realized we do not know enough about our favorite small nut. We fixed that. And here’s what we learned: 1 Pine nuts come from pine cones. \\uf118 Flickr: BobMacInnes Once you read that sentence, it seems obvious. But we’ll gladly admit that we had never put the two together until recently. But knowing this fact makes us love pine nuts even more. Read on to find exactly how they’re formed. 2 Some pine nuts take three years to mature. \\uf118 Flickr: cogdogblog Most pine nuts take roughly 18 months, but some can take up to three years. They bud in the beginning of spring and grow until the end of summer. The cones become dormant during fall and winter and reach maturity come the following spring/summer season. 3 Pine nuts are very difficult to harvest. \\uf118 Flickr: brewbooks Pine nuts are ready to harvest about 10 days before the green cone begins to open. The cones are dried in a burlap bag in the sun for 20 days, to speed up the process of drying and opening. The cones are then smashed (as a way to quickly release the seeds) and the seeds are separated by hand from the cone fragments. The fact that it takes a lot of time and patience is an understatement — and justifies the high price of pine nuts. 4 The pine cone is only the pine nuts’ first shell. \\uf118 Flickr: Zwedlana Pine nuts have a second shell, which also has to be removed before eating. (Are you beginning to finally forgive the high price?) The shell varies from very thick and challenging to remove to thinner and therefore easier to handle. 5 But pine nuts taste so good, so we deal with it. \\uf118 Flickr: thebittenword.com They make pestos possible. They’re awesome toasted on top of pastas. They even give cookies an edge. Thank you pine nuts. 6 Pine nuts prefer the Northern Hemisphere. \\uf118 Flickr: Serge Melki While all pine trees will produce a pine nut, there are only about 18 species that produce nuts large enough to be of value as human food. These trees are found in Asia, Europe and North America. 7 Pine nut mouth is real. \\uf118 Flickr: StuartWebster Pine nuts can cause taste disturbance. It’s known as pine nut mouth or pine nut syndrome. It causes everything you eat to have a bitter, metallic taste. Luckily it’s not permanent — it only lasts a couple of days. It’s hypothesized that the particular species of pine responsible for this is the Pinus armandii in China. 8 Pine nut allergies are real too. \\uf118 Flickr: jules:stonesoup But a whole lot less common. 9 Not all pine nuts are created equal. \\uf118 Flickr: the cardinal de la ville The European variety are long and slender. Those from Asia are shorter and stubbier. The American pinyon nuts are larger and easier to shell. 10 People have been eating pine nuts since the Paleolithic period. \\uf118 Flickr: wetwebwork Roman soldiers took them as campaign food when they raided Britain over 2000 years ago. And Greek authors mentioned pine nut trees as food producers as early as 300 BC. 11 Pine nuts are good for you, so eat up. \\uf118 Flickr: veganbaking.net They are rich in the same healthy fats that other nuts contain and are full of antioxidants.

              " {'human_spoiler': 'Writer is alleging that the iPhone 6 Plus \"bendgate\" issue is having prolonged consequences on the Touch IC touchscreen sensors.',\n",
              "  'context': 'As Apple is preparing to ship its brand new iPhone, the company continues to ignore one of the worst hardware defects to ever plague its smartphone line. Just two years after it was released, the touchscreens of thousands upon thousands of iPhone 6 Pluses are completely losing their functionality under normal use, which experts say is the long-term effect of the engineering flaw that gave us \"bendgate.\" By most accounts, dead touchscreens have become an iPhone 6 Plus epidemic, and yet the company has not commented on it, leaving consumers uninformed and harming independent repair businesses. In many cases, Apple has charged hundreds of dollars to replace a broken phone with a refurbished one that is subject to the same engineering defect that caused the phone to break in the first place. \"Touch Disease\" On the logic board of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, there are two tiny chips called \"Touch IC\" chips that translate your finger presses into machine-readable information. The thing is, these chips are located in a part of the iPhone 6 Plus that is particularly susceptible to bending and flexing, which is a known issue of the phone. The phone flexes ever-so-slightly thousands of times over the course of normal usage: as you pull it into and out of your pocket, or sit on it, or drop it. Eventually, all those-micro flexes add up, and the solder that holds the chips to the logic board comes loose, leading to a condition that the repair industry is calling \"touch disease.\" There are many different severities of touch disease, but its most common tell is a series of grey bars on the top of the iPhone’s screen that is accompanied by intermittent touch screen responses. Some users report having to apply force to certain parts of their phone to temporarily reestablish touch functionality; others report having touch functionality on certain parts of their phone but not others; in many cases, the phone is completely unusable and unresponsive to touch. Replacing the screen itself is not a remedy, because the Touch IC chips are on the logic board of the phone. Because the iPhone 6 does not flex nearly as much as the iPhone 6 Plus, Touch IC problems are rare (but not unheard of) in the smaller phone. For the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, Apple moved the physical location of the Touch IC chips off of the logic board and onto the underside of the screen display itself, which is why 3D Touch is possible on those phones. \"It’s absolutely a problem in the design. End users are not doing anything to cause this besides using the phone normally,\" Mark Shaffer of independent repair company iPad Rehab told me. \"Really all you can do is avoid any activity that would cause the phone to flex. Don’t drop it, definitely don’t put it in any case that requires you to apply force to the phone to get it into and out of the case. Don’t put it in your back pocket, don’t put it in your front pocket if it’s a tight pocket. Actually, don’t put it in any pocket.\" These are what the two IC Touch chips look like. Image: iFixit That \"touch disease\" is happening is no secret. Independent repair experts I’ve spoken to say that they’ve seen the issue in iPhone 6 Pluses since soon after launch, but are seeing a major surge in the number of phones that have the issue as the warranties on the iPhone 6 expire and as the Touch IC connectors wear out with age. \"I feel like most of my job now is just replacing Touch ICs,\" Shaffer said. \"We really started doing them in November after the phones came off warranty and it’s increased from a handful every month to now, we’re seeing daily anywhere from five to 15.\" An excerpt from a class-action lawsuit demanding Apple address the issue. Moe Muscati, general manager of New York City’s The Phone Works & Co. , told me that in the last few months the number of phones he’s seen with this problem have skyrocketed. \"Let’s say you have 10 iPhone 6 Pluses,\" he said. \"About five out of 10 that come in here have this problem.\" Jessa Jones, who started iPad Rehab said on a webinar dedicated to the issue that it’s \"the single biggest defect we’ve ever seen,\" adding that even phones that have been placed in heavy-duty Otterbox cases are beginning to have the issue. \"It kind of went from ‘Hey we’re seeing a lot of these’ to ‘Hey, we’re seeing nothing but these,\" she said. \"I don’t have the data to need to say how prevalent this is across all phones, but we’re seeing this repair more than any other repair. We used to see it only with phones that got dropped, because that seems to exacerbate the problem. But now we’re seeing phones that have been Otterboxed from the beginning starting to get them.\" Jones says she\\'s been inundated with phones that have touch disease. Image: Jessa Jones/Instagram No one has been able to nail down the actual number of phones that have this problem, but an Apple Insider report that cites anonymous Genius Bar employees at four large Apple Stores found that 11 percent of all iPhone-related service issues at those stores were related to Touch IC problems, and Touch IC issues made up about a third of all iPhone 6 Plus-related problems at those stores. AppleInsider and others have reported that Apple is well aware of the issue and Genius Bars even reportedly have a codename for the problem The Apple support forums are filled with \" iPhone 6 Plus intermittent unresponsive screens ,\" and still the company has said nothing. Apple did not respond to my repeated requests for comment. If you work for Apple and have information relating to iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen problems, please email me: jason.koebler@vice.com or use our SecureDrop. My PGP key is here and I am available on OTR as well. In late August, the McCuneWright law firm filed a class-action lawsuit against Apple that claimed the company \"has long been aware of the defective iPhones.\" \"Notwithstanding its longstanding knowledge of this design defect, Apple routinely has refused to repair the iPhones without charge when the defect manifests,\" the lawsuit reads. \"Many other iPhone owners have communicated with Apple’s employees and agents to request that Apple remedy and/or address the Touchscreen Defect and/or resultant damage at no expense. Apple has failed and/or refused to do so.\" Richard McCune, a partner at McCuneWright who is heading up the lawsuit, told me that since he’s filed it, more than 6,500 people have contacted his firm saying that their phones have been affected. That Apple has been sued does not prevent the company from commenting on the issue and it doesn’t prevent the company from offering a solution or at least letting customers know what to do if their touchscreen suddenly stops working. Earlier this year, for instance, Apple was sued about \"Error 53,\" an iOS feature that bricked iPhones that had their TouchID sensors replaced. While that case was still ongoing, Apple pushed a software update that fixed the issue. \"I suspect they haven’t said anything about it because they don’t have a fix for it, so they don’t admit there’s a problem, that they have tens of thousands of phones out there they have to do something about,\" McCune said. \"The thing I’m really surprised at is that as much as Apple has worked on its brand image with customers, that it would allow this significant, widespread problem to be going on and not say a word.\" With the vast majority of iPhone 6 Pluses out of warranty at this point, if you take an iPhone 6 Plus with touchscreen problems to the Apple Store, Apple will charge between $100 and $329 to replace the phone, according to McCune’s survey of customers, which also jives with Apple Insider’s reporting and my own. But Apple’s big problem is that the only way to reliably fix Touch IC issues is to remove the tiny chips themselves and replace them with new ones. This requires a microscope (to fix the problem properly you must be accurate to a millimeter level), a steady hand, and some serious microsoldering skills that are rare even in the repair industry. A handful of repair people like Jones and Shaffer have been inundated with requests to repair touch diseased phones , and we’ve been able to piece together the mechanism of the phone’s failure and Apple’s repair protocols because of their analysis. \"People are coming in with a cracked screen and they’re replacing it, but the phones still don’t work, and independent shops are just absorbing the costs of that.\" Some repair people who perform the fix told me they believe that Apple just recycles phones that have broken Touch IC chips and doesn’t bother to repair them. Others have said they’ve found leftover solder flux on logic boards that have touch disease, suggesting that Apple has refurbished them. \"They have no incentive to repair anything or to offer us any help. Why invest in this complicated repair when they can throw it in the garbage and give you a brand new one?\" Thomas Heffernan of Burlington, Vermont’s Wires Computing, who repairs Touch IC issues, told me. \"Either way, they’re selling a new phone to somebody, whether it’s your insurance company or it’s you.\" Removing solder around the Touch IC\\'s spot on the logic board. Image: Microsoldering/YouTube In practice, Apple is not ever repairing and returning your phone, and so the service Apple offers is not a repair one but a replacement one, meaning that if you take your phone into the Apple Store with a problem, chances are you’ll pay between $100 and $329 for a refurbished replacement phone. The problem with refurbished iPhone 6 Pluses is that Apple is replacing one phone with an inherent design flaw with another phone that both has that same design flaw and has old parts from a phone that was broken and has been repaired. Most people probably know that a getting a refurbished phone is not exactly like getting a new phone, but by refusing to acknowledge that the Touch IC problem is in the actual engineering of the phone itself and not in how people are using the phones, Apple isn’t really giving consumers the full story. To ensure the phones don’t break again, iPadRehab has taken to soldering an extra heat shield above the chips that allows the logic board to flex more without unseating the Touch IC chips, which so far has seemed to be the only reliable long-term fix to the issue. \"As time goes on more and more devices that I see are Apple refurbished\" Repair experts I spoke with say that they are increasingly seeing touch disease on Apple-designated replacement phones. They say they often see refurbished phones with bent or warped logic boards that have clearly been recycled from other damaged phones and are thus more susceptible to touch disease. Apple offers a much reduced 90-day warranty on refurbished products, meaning there’s really no guarantee that the $329 refurbished replacement phone will last much longer than three months. In a Facebook post , Ben Duffy of Australia\\'s Geelong MicroSoldering, which repairs Touch IC issues, wrote he had \"personally encountered replacement devices issued by Apple ... that not only have the same issue, but have been recycled from very clearly bent devices (the board inside the device is bent, however the device is not).\" The Apple support thread on this issue is 76 pages long and is full of people who have found themselves with Touch IC issues more than once. \"The uncool thing Apple is doing is knowingly giving someone a refurbished phone for $329, knowing that phone has a board in it that came from another phone,\" Jones said. Shaffer told me that Apple-refurbished phones are getting touch disease and are making their way to his microscope. \"There are some telltale signs we know to look for to tell if it’s a refurbished phone. They put a little blue mark near the top of the board, and there’s this glue near the CPU shield that isn’t on any other phones,\" Shaffer said. \"When we look up the model number, there are codes that signify it’s a refurbished or replacement device. I did seven last night and three were refurbished.\" The jury-rigged heat shields that iPad Rehab puts on their touch disease repairs. The top image shows the shield off of the logic board, and the second shows the shield when installed. Images: Mark Shaffer Duffy told me in an email that he \"sees Apple refurbished devices daily.\" \"There is definitely evidence Apple have someone repairing [touch diseased] devices as they don\\'t even make an effort to clean the flux any more,\" he said. \"As time goes on more and more devices that I see are Apple refurbished. In the case of the 6 Plus, many of them have warped or bent motherboards, and in many cases the issues they have are directly related to the repair that has been previously performed.\" \"I think Apple need to make it clear that when you get a ‘replacement device’ that it is not equal to a new device, and was returned by another customer with issues like Touch IC,\" he added. \"There is a common belief that consumers are better off taking a device to Apple for replacement as they are then getting a ‘new’ device. Not only is that not true, but Apple don\\'t explain this to people. What they do do, on the support forums and in store, is tell people that independent repair is a bad move. The reality is that in most cases, you are better having your device repaired by an independent technician as they will disclose what they are doing to repair an issue.\" The Toll on Independent Repair Apple’s silence isn’t just hurting consumers. While people who can actually repair a logic board are seeing a huge bump in their businesses, those who traffic in run-of-the-mill screen replacements and the like are facing an entirely different issue. Because dropping a phone can trigger a Touch IC problem, there are lots of phones that have both cracked screen and touch disease. \"People bring in the phone with a cracked screen expecting a simple cheap repair,\" Heffernan said. \"Then you tell them it’s probably a motherboard issue and they don’t believe you. They say ‘Is it something you did?’ ‘Did you break my phone?’\" This is a story I heard over and over again. Without official Apple acknowledgment of the issue, independent repair shops either have to get very good at explaining to customers that they might be screwed or have to be very selective about what phones they will take. Muscati of Phone Works & Co—which does not have the ability to do Touch IC repairs—says before his shop became aware of widespread Touch IC problems, he would replace customers’ phones thinking that his techs had broken them. \"It’s unquestionably has hurt us a lot because we want to do good customer service, and we were worried that a customer would think it was our fault and sue us,\" he said. \"A lot of times we will refuse to do any repair on an iPhone 6 Plus because of how often we see the problem.\" Signs that touch disease is happening to Apple\\'s refurbished phones: The top image has a telltale blue mark. The \\'N\\' on the model number (from the same phone, powered up), signifies that it is a replacement device. Images: Mark Shaffer I called up Dan Rivoire, director of iFixit Pro, which sells wholesale parts to repair professionals around the country, to see if Muscati’s story sounded plausible. \"I had the same conversation with three shops over the last week,\" Rivoire said. \"People are coming in with a cracked screen and they’re replacing it, but the phones still don’t work, and shops are just absorbing the costs of that. The shops that know about this problem are doing their best to mitigate the problem of angry customers by explaining up front that they may not be able to fix it.\" Apple has a long history of making life difficult for repair people who are unaffiliated with Apple, but the company has also never faced an iPhone hardware issue that Jones calls a \"classic, signature failure.\" Repairing these phones en masse or issuing a recall is probably not possible or likely at this point, but Jones, iFixit, and others are calling for Apple to extend the warranty on refurbished iPhone 6 Pluses. At the very least, they say, Apple needs to acknowledge the engineering flaw and tell customers that refurbished phones may be susceptible to this problem. So far, the story of the iPhone 6 Plus touch disease has been one that’s been pieced together by consumers, unaffiliated repair professionals, and vague statements by anonymous employees at Apple Stores. I asked Apple for comment on this story twice, and emailed a separate Apple contact I have, who works in a separate branch of Apple’s PR team. He told me he had forwarded the email to the appropriate person. Apple did not respond to my questions. It would be useful to know how often the company is seeing this issue, what the standard protocol is for customers who bring touch diseased phones to Apple Stores, whether Apple actually does Touch IC repairs itself, and whether it plans on offering an extended warranty, discounted upgrades, or any other fixes to people whose phones have suddenly stopped working. In any case, Apple will have to respond to McCune’s lawsuit at some point, likely before the end of the month. Apple cannot ignore this problem forever. -- Apple Is Still Ignoring One of the Biggest iPhone Engineering Flaws of All Time',\n",

              "  'context': 'What if you could become a top performer with ONE habit while halving how much you work every week? This one strategy can change everything. I used to think you had to luck out and have incredible talent. I still meet people every day who tell me they believe this. But once I learned that doing this instead could make me more successful, I got really excited. Before I get to what it is, check out what I found in my research: A study in Outliers tracked people with the highest IQ in the world from birth until adulthood. At first, they were doing wonderfully. But once they got older, their success was no different than a random control group. Some were garbage collectors or worse! What’s the message? That most people think IQ, an unchangeable measure of skill, is the key to success. And i t isn’t. Half of adults use this belief as a crutch so they can have an excuse to not improve their lives. They prefer laziness and will turn away to facts. Don’t be like this. So what’s the key? Willpower. Having studied numerous billionaires , I have found that self-discipline and willpower are the key to success. I recently read a book called 15 Productivity Secrets, which interviews numerous billionaires. One of them said that he had met a ton of people smarter than him, but unable to do what they had committed to do. That’s why they were less successful. The magic formula is to be disciplined to do the things no one wants to do. Billionaire John Paul DeJoria said \"Successful people do what unsuccessful people are unwilling to do.\" Work on improving your willpower and discipline by doing a small thing that will impact your future for the better every day. But you can do even better. What if you chose something that had the biggest impact on your life? How about 1 extra book that taught you about business or money? What about 10 extra minutes at the gym? According to studies: Willpower is like a muscle. You can exhaust it in a day, which leaves you vulnerable to poor decisions and temptations. Don’t over-exert your willpower but spend some time using it properly to train it. What have we learned so far? Successful people aren’t there just because they were born with a \"gift.\" Many weren’t. This is an old-fashioned myth. The key to success is willpower. Work on strengthening and improving it. Everyone can do this. Most people don’t. People use false beliefs as an excuse or crutch to remain lazy. Will Smith said in an interview that he didn’t have any extra talent, sex appeal, fitness, intelligence, or anything else. He simply had the work ethic to do what was necessary. Simple, right? You say: \"Great idea. But...I have no time to do something extra once a day I don’t want to! I’m already exhausted!\" HAHAHAHA! \"Not enough time.\" Most people who say this are wasting hours of time every day. I can easily catch them watching a TV show they don’t have to or spending extra time chatting with friends. Those extra minutes add up. Try this. Have something that you want so bad that the fear and pain are pushed aside because of the dream. Dream big. Log every activity for the day. I did this and I found that my most blatant waste of time were the 4 to 5 hours after 5pm everyday. For example: Dinner – (5pm) – 30 minutes Watching Youtube videos — 1 hour Browsing the web — 1 hour Using social media – 1 hour Playing video games (or game apps) — 1 hour Wasting time chatting at the gym when I should be working out — 30 minutes Those are exaggerated estimates but you get the point. On a typical weekday, we have hours of time we waste. You’ll be surprised to discover that you probably have 3-6 hours of things you could easily do less of. AND EVEN MORE ON A WEEKEND! Imagine your dream life 3 years from now. Figure out what activities won’t get you there. Figure out which will. Smalltalk conversation won’t get you there. Watching Youtube won’t get you there. But doing the right task will. Maybe for you, that’s exercising more. Maybe it’s spending more time marketing your business. Now that you know that X is more valuable than Y, start right this instant. Choose 1 task Spend 10 extra minutes on it a day Start small so you don’t burn out (like I have) Work your way up to effectively using the hours you waste Find a way to make it fun so you don’t burn out Get started right away. And I’ll see you at the top. Keep up the heat! This Single Habit Will Put You In The Top 10%',\n",

              "  'context': 'Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates have all attributed their success to one factor. In fact, this one trait is behind the success of all people that have performed massively better than the average person. Read on to find out what the trait is and how you can put it into practice in your own life and investing. The most important factor for success According to Alice Schroeder, in 1991 when Bill Gates\\' dad asked Buffett and Gates what the most important factor for their success was, they both gave the same answer, \"focus.\" Gates\\' focus was illustrated in Walter Isaacson\\'s new book The Innovators, as well as Gates\\' fellow Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen: One trait that differentiated the two was focus. Allen\\'s mind would flit between many ideas and passions, but Gates was a serial obsessor. \"Where I was curious to study everything in sight, Bill would focus on one task at a time with total discipline,\" said Allen. \"You could see it when he programmed. He would sit with a marker clenched in his mouth, tapping his feet and rocking; impervious to distraction.\" Steve Jobs was the same way; he was relentlessly focused on attacking problems searching for the best answer. Apple\\'s founding marketing philosophy had three main tenets the second of which is focus: In order to do a good job of those things we decide to do we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities. Focus was key for Buffett as well, Schroeder writes: \"He ruled out paying attention to almost anything but business—art, literature, science, travel, architecture—so that he could focus on his passion.\" Why is this so important? In life and investing, you need to be relentlessly focused on your goals if you want to have better than average results. Differentiation To stick out from the crowd, you need to do something better than everyone else. There\\'s no standard definition of what \"better\" is though. McDonald\\'s does low prices and quick drive through service while Chipotle does massive burritos with a great service culture . They both have been wildly successful as they focus on doing one thing well. What gets companies and people into trouble is when they try and do too much, leading to mediocrity. McDonalds has been suffering lately as its menu has grown to accommodate so many different items that is has gotten unwieldy , leading to a confusing menu and longer wait times. Apple was a disaster with 350 different products before Jobs came back in 1998. He refocused the business around the customer experience, simplifying Apple\\'s focus to just 10 products. Everyone knows the rest of the story. Successful investing Like success in life and business, to be successful in investing, you need focus and time if you want to do better than average. As Warren Buffett has explained, \"Successful Investing takes time, discipline and patience. No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: You can\\'t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.\" Just getting to average performance is hard enough. While by definition, the average investor cannot do better than average, the average investor would do nearly 80% better if he or she simply earned the average market return. Most investors would be better off in index funds. The first key part to be successful is to learn the mistakes that hold people back and avoid them. For investors these include being too active , overconfident , loss-averse , taking on debt to invest , and making rash decisions based on daily market movements , among others. The second part is to know what your goals are and have a process where you constantly learn, think independently , and quickly try and figure out when you are wrong . You need to go put in the effort so that you can evaluate a selection of businesses and build a circle of competence , that is a set of businesses and industries that you can understand and can independently evaluate. Only then will you be able to select businesses whose values are misjudged by the market, providing an opportunity for you to profit. To get to that point, Buffett suggests: Read 500 pages like this [annual reports, trade journals, etc.] every day. That\\'s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it. Most people don\\'t do this. The key is to realize the limits of your knowledge, you can\\'t know and be good at everything. For this reason, most people shouldn\\'t try and invest in stocks to beat the market since they can\\'t put in the time and focus. However, by learning about investing and how to evaluate businesses you build knowledge that will help you understand your job better, your industry better, and everyday life better. As Buffett has said, \"I am a better investor because I am a businessman and I am a better businessman because I am an investor.\" Investing is a lifelong journey, not a sprint. If you are willing to put in the time and focus, a commitment to learning how to invest will pay dividends for the rest of your life.

              "  'context': 'Even if you work out as often as you can, odds are that doesn’t translate into doing intense exercise every single day. And that’s actually a good thing—peppering your workout schedule with off days is often key for reaching your fitness goals because the time to recuperate can help your muscles get even stronger. But there’s some confusion about what it really means to take a \"rest day,\" a topic celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson covers in a new interview with The Cut. \"As long as you’re not being invasive for your body and muscles, you don’t need a day to relax and repair. You need a day to relax and repair when you’re abusing your body,\" she says in the interview. But that’s actually not true—taking a step back from your typical workouts is often a great idea, and it’s not only necessary if you’re \"abusing\" your body. \"You can’t expect someone to ‘go hard’ day in and day out and not think accumulated fatigue won’t enter the picture at some point,\" Boston-based certified strength and conditioning specialist Tony Gentilcore, tells SELF. Keep in mind that taking a rest day doesn’t always mean doing absolutely nothing, as Anderson notes: \"It’s so important to connect to yourself every day,\" she tells The Cut. But there’s a middle ground between a complete rest day and breaking a real sweat. That’s why Gentilcore and many other fitness experts recommend adding active recovery days into your workout routine. Basically, it means you engage in gentle activity to allow your body to rest and rebuild muscle fibers that you tear while exercising. That can be anything from going for a walk to doing light yoga or taking a chill bike ride—the key is to get up and moving. And a major perk is that this kind of activity can make your actual workouts even more effective. Consider active recovery the fitness rule you don’t want to break. Albert Matheny, M.S., R.D., C.S.C.S., of SoHo Strength Lab and Promix Nutrition, is a fan of active recovery. \"Active recovery is better than a rest day because your body and muscles recover faster with light work rather than complete rest,\" he tells SELF. Active recovery helps deliver blood to your muscles quickly, bringing nutrients and oxygen to help the muscles repair and recover, he says.Although this would happen even if you were at rest, the benefit of active recovery is that oxygen-rich blood pumps through your body faster when you’re moving, giving your muscles more of the fuel they need to repair the micro-tears that occur when you work out, Matheny explains. \"Active recovery days can be important in maintaining momentum while training,\" Doug Sklar, a certified personal trainer and founder of New York City-based fitness training studio PhilanthroFIT, tells SELF. \"Rather than completely forgo fitness, active recovery days allows you to do something healthful while still allowing your body to recover from a previous higher intensity workout.\" How you incorporate active recovery depends on the type and intensity of exercise you’re doing, as well as your personal goals. \"But generally speaking, it’s a good idea to balance high-intensity workouts with lighter work,\" Sklar says. Meaning, if you go for a long run one day, cut yourself some slack and go easier the next day. To help you figure it all out, here’s what a perfect week of working out looks like. Gentilcore says it’s also important to give yourself a break and take a full day of rest if you need it—physically or mentally. Maybe you’re sick, injured, would rather spend time celebrating a friend’s birthday than working out, or have any other very valid reason to skip an exercise session. Sometimes life gets in the way, and if you can’t always fit exercise in, that’s OK. Also know this: Rest and recovery days won’t derail your fitness goals. \"Just like you can’t become super-fit after one workout, you won’t lose all that you’ve worked for by taking one day off,\" says Sklar.

The reboot has received flak over its gender swap concept while the film’s trailer became the most disliked in YouTube history. At the premiere of the film at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, McCarthy blasted the film’s critics saying: ‘Any time someone critiques something that has not yet been made, I find peculiar. ‘It’s like giving a book review to an author who’s like \"I haven’t written it yet\". ‘I don’t pay much attention to it. It’s not based in the world.’ The reboot features an all-female cast (Picture: Columbia Pictures) While Wiig added: ‘It’s really sad that people felt that way, in combination with actually not listening to it. ‘We knew we were making the movie in the spirit of the first two, with the people who made the first two. People need to stop being so mean.’ The film has earned mixed reviews from film critics.

In our latest study, we analyzed anonymized details from more than 5.4 million sales pipeline transactions to uncover significant trends in sales cycle lengths, close rates, deal sizes, opportunity counts and overall pipeline health. We also surveyed 600 sales leaders to capture their insights on the key factors that are driving these trends. Among other questions, we asked them who is the most difficult executive to deal with when they miss their numbers. Here’s a snapshot of their answers: CFO: 58.8% CEO: 14.8% CRO: 14.8% CMO: 6.6% COO: 5.1% The No. 1 answer, by a long shot, was CFO. It makes sense that a chief financial officer might flash his fangs in response to anemic bookings, but according to the rest of the data in our quarterly report, the It makes sense that a chief financial officer might flash his fangs in response to anemic bookings, but according to the rest of the data in our quarterly report, the Business Growth Index , most sales leaders really don’t have much to fear this year. Tell your CFO to chill Even though sales cycles grew 6.4% longer and close rates declined by 2.1% last year compared with 2014, more than 75% of sales leaders still predict steady or accelerated growth in 2016, according to our research. Other key indicators of sales growth are on the rise: Opportunity count: +12.6% Deal size: +5.5% Pipeline growth: +4.5% It appears that many sales teams, particularly in the high-tech sector, are rapidly moving upmarket. In the Business Growth Index study, sales leaders attributed swollen sales cycles to the proactive pursuit of bigger deals, which are often more complex and take longer to close. Deal sizes climbed the most in the high-tech industry (9.7%) and on the West Coast (18.5%), which bodes well for Silicon Valley. Sales leaders in all industries remain optimistic, projecting sales growth of 30.5% in 2016 compared with 23% growth in 2015. All signs point to continued growth as sales teams adopt new playbooks to tackle new challenges. So maybe your CFO is just paranoid.

No matter what your feelings are about the result of Sunday's WWE Universal Championship match at Fastlane, there's no denying that keeping it simple was as effective a device for how things played out as the WWE could have conceived of. Rating Summary: Another Goldberg match. Another quick win. There's not much else to say here. It was predictable and sets up the Owens/Jericho collision at WrestleMania and raises the stakes for the Goldberg/Lesnar match. Totals (1 possible point for each) -- Sean Coyle Goldberg defeated Kevin Owens after a distraction from Chris Jericho, becoming the second-oldest WWE world champion in the company's history at age 50. This victory also sets the stage for Goldberg's scheduled match for WrestleMania 33 against Brock Lesnar to be the prohibitive favorite to occupy the traditional main event slot at the biggest show of the year. With less than a minute left in the traditional broadcast window, there was very little hope that the match for the WWE Universal Championship match at Fastlane -- which started at 10:59 -- would amount to anything but spear, jackhammer, 1-2-3. As WWE stretched the broadcast beyond that traditional window, however, with Owens sliding out of the ring to waste time, several other possibilities seemed to be possible. Owens teased getting back into the ring several times, playing mind games with his intense opponent by stepping back out and pacing on the outside of the ring. Even after fully stepping back into the ring once, Owens immediately dropped down and rolled under the bottom rope. The entire escapade lasted more than five minutes. As Owens finally prepared himself for the match and beckoned Goldberg to the middle of the ring, thinking he'd already gotten through much of his opponent's stamina, Jericho's music hit just seconds before the bell finally rang to start the match. As Owens turned, incredulous that his long-time best friend had arrived, Goldberg promptly hit a spear. Owens writhed on the ground in pain for several seconds before being picked up and dropped by a jackhammer. Three seconds later, Goldberg became the third ever WWE Universal champion. This loss ends Owens' reign as Universal champion at 188 days. After Finn Balor relinquished the title one day after winning it against Seth Rollins at SummerSlam, Owens won a Fatal 4-Way elimination match on Monday Night Raw by pinning Rollins (with an assist from Triple H).

Whatever circumstance leads you to the stage on karaoke night, here’s a tip: Avoid \"My Way\" by Frank Sinatra. It doesn’t matter if it’s Rat Pack night. It doesn’t matter if you happened to wear your best fedora. It doesn’t even matter if you could be a voice double for Ol’ Blue Eyes himself. If you value your life, do not allow yourself to be seduced by \"My Way\" when you see it in the selection book—it’s literally a killer. In 2007, a man was performing the song in San Mateo in the Philippines when a security guard loudly informed the singer that he was off-key. When man continued to croon, the guard pulled out a .38 caliber pistol and shot the performer in the chest, killing him. Freak occurrence? Nope. Since 2000, at least half a dozen people have been murdered after (or while) performing the Sinatra classic. Dubbed the \"‘My Way’ Killings,\" the strange phenomenon has gotten so bad that some bar owners have removed it from the selection list entirely. Theories abound as to why this particular song seems to evoke such violence. It could be that the song is just so Sinatra that anyone else who sings it is bound to pale in comparison. It could be, according to singing school owner Butch Albarracin, that the lyrics inspire \"pride and arrogance in the singer, as if you’re somebody when you’re really nobody.\" Pop culture expert Roland Tolentino believes it’s all about location—these killings have all occurred in the Philippines. \"The Philippines is a very violent society, so karaoke only triggers what already exists here when certain social rules are broken,\" he said. While the \"My Way\" Killings do seem to be limited to a certain locale, karaoke rage seems to happen all over the world. My advice: The next time you find yourself with a microphone and a screen of lyrics in front of your face, opt for something—anything—other than Sinatra. The Karaoke Song That Kills',\n",

              "  'context': 'HealthCare.gov, the online portal to Obamacare enrollment, will reliably allow consumers to shop and sign up for health coverage by late November, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama said Friday. Nearly a month after the launch of the health insurance exchanges that are central to Obama\\'s health care reform law, the HealthCare.gov website and the information technology behind it continue to pose problems to consumers and health insurance companies alike. On Friday, health care entrepreneur and Obama adviser Jeffrey Zients, who is overseeing a so-called tech surge to repair the site, for the first time offered a concrete timeline for the project. \"By the end of November, HealthCare.gov will work smoothly for the vast majority of users,\" Zients said during a conference call with reporters. \"The bottom line is the performance of the system has been unacceptable,\" Zients said, echoing an assessment Obama offered Monday. \"We\\'re executing a plan of attack and the system is getting better.\" At its worst, HealthCare.gov only allowed three out of 10 users to get all the way through the application for financial assistance, he said. \"The HealthCare.gov site is fixable. It\\'ll take a lot of work and there are a lot of problems that need to be addressed,\" he said. Zients is a former official at the White House Office of Management and Budget and will become director of the White House National Economic Council at the beginning of next year. The administration has described his involvement with Obamacare implementation as short-term. Reaching this newly announced late-November target would give consumers as little as two weeks to choose a health insurance plan that would be in place at the beginning of next year. Because of lag times between selecting coverage and its effective date, the latest an individual or family could make the first payment to their insurer is Dec. 15 if they want benefits in place by Jan. 1. This latest assessment follows months of assurances by Obama and numerous administration officials that HealthCare.gov would be fully operational when it debuted Oct. 1, including statements made just days before the online marketplace launched. The administration expected to enroll 7 million people into health coverage via the more than 30 exchanges being run by the federal government and the more than a dozen operated by states, based on Congressional Budget Office projections. The open enrollment period for 2014 runs until March 31. The health insurance exchanges have processed about 700,000 applications for financial assistance to date, and almost half came through the federal system, which includes HealthCare.gov, a telephone hotline and paper applications, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille. Applications for tax credits to cut health insurance costs aren\\'t the same as actual enrollments, however. Consumers eligible for financial assistance also must choose a private health plan and make a payment to be enrolled. The Obama administration won\\'t release enrollment figures until the middle of next month, though some state-run health insurance exchanges are reporting tens of thousands of enrollments into private health insurance and Medicaid so far. In a major shift, the administration has assigned a private company as the \"general contractor\" overseeing the federal health insurance exchanges and HealthCare.gov, Zients said. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had been responsible for coordinating the multiple contractors working on the technology until now, and contractors at a House committee hearing Thursday said it was the agency\\'s decision to postpone full testing of the system until the two weeks before its Oct. 1 launch. A unit of the health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group will take over this coordination, Zients said. Quality Software Services Inc., or QSSI, is a unit of Optum, a UnitedHealth Group company. UnitedHealth Group was not among the health insurance companies represented at a meeting with White House officials Wednesday. QSSI built the data hub used by the federally managed and state-run health insurance exchanges, which serves as the conduit for information transmitted between consumers, multiple government computer systems and health insurance companies. Despite concerns prior to the debut of the exchanges, the data hub has performed well, Zients said. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expanding QSSI\\'s existing contract, Bataille said. The administration will not disclose what other companies or individuals are participating in the Obamacare \"tech surge.\" \"There\\'s a clear path forward,\" Zients said. \"There\\'s a \\'punch list\\' of fixes, and we\\'re going to punch them out one by one.\" Issues include problems on the user end, such as navigating through the registration, application and enrollment processes, and on the back end, like health insurance companies receiving corrupted data about their new customers, he said. \"There will be a relentless focus on speed and execution to work through the punch list. Each week the site will get better.\" The administration also is looking into rectifying a quirk with the enrollment deadlines that could subject some people to a portion of the tax penalties for violating the law\\'s individual mandate to have insurance. Currently, consumers would have to select a health plan by Feb. 15 to avoid partial penalties. The administration is working to ensure that anyone who buys health insurance by the end of enrollment on March 31 won\\'t be penalized, Bataille said. The White House announced it was pursuing this policy on Monday. Obamacare Website Will \\'Work Smoothly\\' By Late November, Official Says',\n",

Carlson first alleged assault in early July and this settlement brings her legal battle to a close. (Erin Patrick O\\'Connor/The Washington Post) Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson settled her sexual harassment case against former boss and Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes for $20 million. Carlson first alleged assault in early July and this settlement brings her legal battle to a close. Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson settled her sexual harassment case against former boss and Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes for $20 million. (Erin Patrick O\\'Connor/The Washington Post) The settlement 21st Century Fox announced Tuesday regarding former anchor Gretchen Carlson, who filed a lawsuit this summer claiming sexual harassment by the powerful -- and now ousted -- Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, was extraordinary in many ways. There was the speed with which the suit went from being filed, on July 6, to being settled, just two months later. There was the reported size of the settlement, $20 million , which employment lawyers say is the largest single plaintiff pre-trial settlement for sexual harassment charges they know of (many are settled privately). But perhaps the most striking aspect of the settlement was the company\\'s public apology to Carlson in its statement, a move employment lawyers said was extremely rare, if not unprecedented, when it comes to sexual harassment claims. \"Typically the last thing a plaintiff ever receives in a pre-trial settlement is an apology,\" said Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer who often represents plaintiffs in sexual harassment lawsuits. \"It clearly is a recognition that she was right that she was treated inappropriately, and that in and of itself is quite stunning.\" In its statement, 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, where Carlson was a former anchor and Ailes was its powerful chairman until recently, praised Carlson\\'s skills and said it was \"proud\" she had been part of the organization. \"We sincerely regret and apologize for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve,\" the In its statement, 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, where Carlson was a former anchor and Ailes was its powerful chairman until recently, praised Carlson\\'s skills and said it was \"proud\" she had been part of the organization. \"We sincerely regret and apologize for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve,\" the statement read More typically, if a settlement is announced at all -- many sexual harassment claims stay quietly under wraps -- it comes with a \"non-statement,\" says Amy Bess, an employment lawyer at Vedder Price. The company denies wrongdoing and says it is moving on to avoid the distraction and uncertainty that comes with the legal process. \"What Fox is trying to do is demonstrate publicly that this is not business as usual,\" Bess said. They\\'re trying \"to make a statement to the public that this company is turning over a new leaf. It\\'s gotten rid of the evil doers, and they\\'re now focusing on a more positive, proactive, non-discriminatory culture that is a good place for women to work.\" Most companies don\\'t make such a statement of regret because it could expose them to some risk. \"It\\'s n ot an admission of legal liability, but it’s still saying she was not treated with the dignity she deserved to be treated with,\" says Dan Eaton, a San Diego-based employment lawyer. \"It sugg ests a company may be amenable to making a settlement on similar terms in future cases.\" (A spokesperson for 21st Century Fox declined to comment about why the company chose to make the apology, but pointed to earlier statements about its prompt investigation and the seriousness with which it has taken the allegations.) Yet in this case, employment lawyers said, Carlson is thought to have negotiated for and demanded nothing less than a public apology. \"Fox, in acknowledging she was treated badly, may be signaling to other employees that there’s going to be a culture change, that they\\'re not going to tolerate this kind of behavior,\" Katz said. \"But I\\'m confident that she insisted upon it.\" (A message to Carlson\\'s lawyer was not immediately returned.) That\\'s partly because it\\'s one of the most basic things plaintiffs desire when they consider pursuing a sexual harassment suit, Katz says. \"It\\'s usually the first thing people who walk into my office want,\" she says. \"We\\'re not just talking about explosive, high-profile claims like this. Even in the most mundane employment situations, people want an acknowledgement. But it\\'s usually the last thing they get.\" Katz said none of her clients had ever received a public apology for similar claims. Besides an apology, one other thing Carlson will be getting, meanwhile, is a $20 million settlement. The size of that payout is larger than any known pre-trial settlement for a sexual harassment claim by a single plaintiff, Katz said, noting that such figures are often kept private. Its size likely reflects Carlson\\'s high compensation as a media figure, as payouts are often determined based on loss of future income. Yet for Fox, Katz said, \"it\\'s a rounding error. The bigger cost is everything else\" -- the legal costs, the reputation damage -- \"that has exploded as a result.\" While $20 million may be larger than other settlements for similar claims, it\\'s also, interestingly, exactly half the size of the exit package Ailes was reportedly paid. After Ailes stepped down as the chairman and CEO of Fox News in July, just two weeks after Carlson\\'s lawsuit was filed, reports said he would receive more than $40 million and remain an adviser to Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox.

In an incident in 1986, dubbed the Ealing Vicarage Rape, three men broke into Saward’s family home, drunk and high on drugs, while Saward, who was 21 at the time, was watching television with her boyfriend, David Kerr. Her father, vicar Michael Saward answered the door and was threatened with a kitchen knife. Two of the men repeatedly raped Jill at knifepoint and brutally attacked her boyfriend and father. But just under a year later, the judge caused outrage when he said Jill’s trauma \"had not been so great\", and gave one of the men more years for the burglary than the rape. Jill suffered flashbacks and nightmares for three-and-a-half years following the attack, and came close to suicide three times. Her identity was kept anonymous throughout the criminal trial, but she made the decision to write a memoir and speak publicly about what happened to her. Jill went on to valiantly work as a case worker for a council’s domestic violence forum, and as a lobbyist for the rights of and support for rape victims. She campaigned to dispel the stigma surrounding rape to help victims not feel shame. She also bravely spoke out about forgiving her attackers. She died at the age of 51 after suffering a stroke.

Comedy duo par excellence Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein recruited photographer Alex Prager for the job, riffing off her most recent series \"A Face In The Crowd.\" Prager\\'s sharp-edged, cinematic shots capture the hustle and bustle of an anonymous crowd, emphasizing the bizarre juxtaposition of physical proximity and mental distance. In the \"Portlandia\" photos, Prager replaces her signature medley of ambiguously retro costumes with an assortment of Portland-esque stereotypes, ripe with vintage prints, handlebar mustaches and a heavy dose of plaid. Prager\\'s images, stylized to the brink of surrealism, perfectly compliment Armisen and Brownstein\\'s affirmative and absurd brand of humor. We reached out to Armisen to discuss Prager\\'s work and ended up discovering his goal is to be Cindy Sherman. Needless to say, our minds were blown. Read on. Were you familiar with Alex\\'s work before the shoot? A little bit, but Carrie was more familiar with it. And I\\'m glad, because nothing is more rewarding than finding out about a new artist. It is such a nice thing, such a nice part about life, getting to know an artist. Although, that being said, when I first saw her work I had the feeling I had seen it before. Yeah there is a strange familiarity to them. Well, yes, but I think I had seen them before. Oh, you literally had seen them! [Laughs] What led you to choose her work in particular for the \"Portlandia\" images? For this season we wanted to do something different than what we\\'d done with previous seasons. The idea of involving an artist, a person who really does make art, really appealed to us. All of the ads we\\'ve done before have just been Carrie and I. This time we wanted to involve more people. The show is very much a group, even thought it\\'s just a few of us, really it\\'s about a city. It\\'s a little world, which is just what Alex creates in her work. I think Carrie brought Alex up and we thought she was perfect. The costumes are hilarious. Whose idea was that? That was all her. This is very much her piece. She has a cast that she uses, and these wigs and costumes that are very much her. When we were talking to her she said she liked wigs to look like wigs, which I think is brilliant. I am so used to making wigs and things look as real as possible, when I heard that I was blown away. \"This Is An Art Project\" is one my favorite Portlandia sketches of all time. Can we look forward to more art-centric bits in the new season? Yes there are! The idea of art is definitely addressed. We try to address art and music as much as we can, so there is definitely an art piece coming up. Can you tell me a little about it? No! The only reason is there is no way that me describing it will be able to do it justice. I also recently saw you perform at MOCA. Are you trying to involve yourself more in the art world? I\\'m just in love with that world. I love everything about it. I went to art school. Right before I started SNL I always wanted to be Cindy Sherman. When I first started hearing about her and seeing her pictures I was like she is doing the best thing ever. Alex Prager and Cindy Sherman have a lot in common as well. I totally agree. Maybe 100 years in the future we can see that as a type of aesthetic. Alex Prager, Cindy Sherman, and also people you and I don\\'t know. That\\'s such a great way to think about all the characters you play. I\\'ll just say that Cindy Sherman is what I aspire to be. \"Portlandia\" returns to IFC on Thursday, February 27, 2014.

              "  'context': 'With Battlefield 1 producing groundbreaking features and currently living up to its hype, there is still one thing that each Battlefield game has been lacking: female soldiers in multiplayer. And it doesn’t look like EA’s next installment will entertain that idea, either. With popular shooters such as Call of Duty and Overwatch including female characters in their multiplayer formats, it’s become quite the norm to play as a woman with guns blazing. However, the Battlefield franchise has never provided this feature, and Battlefield 1 will be no different. (Note that this is regards to online multiplayer only, because there is a playable female character in the story mode.) What’s really entertaining is the reason behind this decision. Originally, females were going to be integrated as playable multiplayer characters, but then the idea was scrapped due to boys not finding it believable. Former DICE coder, Amanda Coget, took to Twitter in order to discuss how the conversation went down. Even though female soldiers in WWI was not a common thing, it happened. And even though Battlefield is more realistic with its play style in comparison to other shooters, it’s still a video game. There is a ton of room for interpretation when it comes to developing battles and fighting because despite how realistic a game is, it’s still pretty fictional. (I mean come on, respawning multiple times in a match is realistic, but playing as a female soldier isn’t?) I’ve never classified myself as a feminist by any means, but this is ridiculous. It’s not upsetting that Battlefield 1 won’t have female soldiers (in multiplayer), but it’s highly offensive that they are catering to boys that wouldn’t find the idea believable. The concept is understandable, but the reasoning is not. This isn’t the first time the game attempted to accommodate to the less informed consumer. EA originally ditched the idea of a World War I setting because they were concerned that kids didn’t know that it actually happened. UPDATE 6/15/16: I just want to clear the air regarding the reasoning behind this article. It is not to start a debate about social equality, women’s rights, or anything of that nature. I don’t care if I have to play a game as a man, woman, alien, worm, or even a piece of chewed up bubble gum; I just like to play video games, regardless of the characters available. This article was written to simply state that it appeared that Battlefield 1 initially wanted to include women in their multiplayer for the first time, but ditched the idea later in order to appease their supposed target audience, which happens to be younger boys.

Gamers worldwide are lining up to purchase copies of the game. It’s no surprise that Blizzard is having a hard time meeting the demand for physical copies, and they’re trying their best to catch up. However, you won’t believe that the company is also having issues keeping up with the demand for the digital version of the game. So much so that it’s making gamers queue up to get a chance to purchase a digital copy of the game. Wait times range from 3 minutes to 10 minutes and the queues are longer than the ones in brick and mortar stores. This just shows how popular Overwatch is and it is looking poised to break a few records. There might be several reasons why Blizzard might be doing this. For one, its servers might be genuinely getting clobbered at the moment due to too many people trying to purchase the game at once, but there’s also the possibility that this is just a safety measure to safeguard itself against possible DDOS attacks which might severely hinder its ability to meet demands. Whatever be the reasons, it’s obvious Blizzard must have considered all other options before taking this measure. It might after eventually force potential buyers from delaying their transaction, and in some rare cases, give up on the idea of buying the game altogether.

My need for perfection and efficiency only heightens my anxiety, which is why I\\'ve become really good at doing mani-pedis and body scrubs right at home. (Bikini waxing... I\\'d rather leave that to the pros.) But at the end of Fashion Month, I don\\'t have enough energy for DIY beauty treatments. So I decided to give up my lunch break to get a 30-minute rose power peel I\\'ve heard other beauty editors chatting about. Skincare creator and aesthetician Cecilia Wong employs a combination of Bulgarian and French rose oils, lemon and papaya extracts, LED light therapy and oxygen for a facial treatment that reduces hyperpigmentation (my biggest skincare woe), soothes sun damage and plumps up the skin. She assured me that I\\'d get off the table with a camera-ready complexion, and that\\'s all she really had to say for me to lie down. Wong started the process by cleansing and then smoothing on a rose petal yogurt peel packed with antioxidants and vitamins A, C, D and E. The scent was heavenly, yet not heady as if I was stuck in a field of flowers. Next, she did a jade roller massage using her Reviving Black Currant Serum. Blended with black currant, blueberry and carrot seed oils, as well as argan oil, she explained that the black currant is actually one of the most potent sources of vitamin C. \"It has 5 times more vitamin C than an orange! It brightens and is a great exfoliation to slough off dry skin,\" said Wong. The roller helped the serum to penetrate deeper into my pores and open up the point meridians to achieve softer skin. The LED light therapy, which stimulates collagen production, was surprisingly painless (keeping my eyes closed to avoid the blinding light was tricky, so protective sunglasses would have helped), and I even dozed off during the process. Wong completed the treatment with a blast of oxygen (the cool tingling sensation could be compared to one of those air in a can dusters) infused with aloe gel, hyaluronic acid and her secret rose serum. Once I was able to snap back into reality, I woke up to see that my face was much brighter and fuller. Plus, there was no redness or irritation. BEFORE AND AFTER: The Rose Power Peel Facial, $175, is available at the Cecilia Wong Skincare Salon in New York City, ceciliawongskincare.com To test the results of the rose power peel, I gave up using my Clarisonic cleansing brush and used a basic peppermint face wash for two weeks.

Here\\'s a little background about Ames, as posted on the Martha Heasly Cox Center For Steinbeck Studies website (part of San Jose State University): Cathy, one of Steinbeck’s most interesting and controversial characters, is born with what the author describes as \"a malformed soul\" in a small Massachusetts town (71). From early on, people are both taken and betrayed by her innocent face. She often makes people feel uneasy, though they would not be able to say why.

              "  'context': 'SAN FRANCISCO -- High in the Sierra Nevada, the Yuba River winds through the northeastern mountains of California. The area, just west of Tahoe National Forest, is home to dense forests, crystal-blue lakes and hills that sparkle with the mineral deposits that gave the area its famous nickname -- Gold Country. The region was the focus of the 1849 Gold Rush, California\\'s great legacy, which led to San Francisco\\'s founding and California\\'s statehood. But the Gold Rush left the state with a darker legacy, as well. In a study published online last week, researchers revealed that mercury from Gold Rush-era mining operations continues to seep into California’s primary water system -- and it may get worse with climate change. \"There’s a tremendous amount of sediment, and the concentrations are so high that it really is scary,\" said the lead author, Michael Singer, a researcher for University of St. Andrews in Scotland and University of California, Santa Barbara. \"This is a problem of DDT proportions,\" he said, referring to the insecticide that inspired Rachel Carson\\'s environmental book Silent Spring. Left from unsafe gold mining practices of the 1800s, the mercury is trapped in sediment in the Sierra Nevada foothills. According to the study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, floods continue to force the toxic metal downstream, adding more mercury to the water system. If climate change predictions are correct, floods and the amount of mercury-laden sediment they force into the water system are likely to increase. \"People assume that it’s no longer a problem, that it’s just a matter of cleanup,\" said Singer. \"But we’ve found that new mercury is entering the system and replenishing the supply. Not only is the mercury already in the water system, but it’s continuing to enter it with each major flood.\" Once the mercury enters the water system and gets downstream, some of it converts to methylmercury, a highly toxic substance absorbed by small organisms, and makes its way up the food chain. When consumed in unsafe levels, such as those found in the Sierra Nevada sediment, the contaminant causes mercury poisoning, affecting the nervous system and causing loss of brain function and coordination. Mercury poisoning can also cause reproductive problems, including birth defects and infertility. Downstream from the Sierra Nevada foothills is the San Francisco Bay Delta Estuary, the nexus of California’s statewide water system and the largest estuary on the west coasts of both North America and South America. The high content of methylmercury not only threatens the fish that live in the estuary, but also the migratory birds that feed on them. While California has no documented cases of mercury poisoning in humans due to Sierra Nevada contamination, the effects have begun showing up in birds. \"The whole food web is being exposed to this issue,\" said Singer. While Singer\\'s study offers new insight into the extent of the problem, the area’s unusually high levels of mercury already were well known. Since discovering the levels in the 1970s, the state and regional water quality control boards have been aggressively using erosion control, sediment removal and remediation efforts at mining sites. \"People started measuring the mercury levels in fish caught in the area and it was at these really high levels,\" said Mark Stephenson, a researcher with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. \"That’s what started all of these programs like Mussel Watch [a contaminant monitoring program]. It really sounded the alarm bell.\" Stephenson has noticed the same conditions Singer described in his paper, and was not surprised by the results, citing climate change as a potential factor that could exacerbate the problem. \"The amount of mercury coming downstream is proportional to the storm. From our research, we’ve found that about 90 percent of the mercury deposits in the past five years came from five major storms -- about one per year,\" Stephenson told HuffPost. \"Some studies have essentially said that due to climate change, infrequent but severe storms are increasing in regularity and intensity. If that’s correct, there will be more mercury mobilized.\" Some policymakers have called the fears overstated. \"After an exhaustive review of all the science surrounding the mercury debate, it is clear that some special-interest groups are crying wolf,\" wrote Richard Pombo, a former state representative, in a 2005 report by the House Resources Committee during the Bush administration. The report was released in anticipation of new regulatory proposals. Representatives from California\\'s mining industry did not deny the mercury problem in a phone call with HuffPost. They urged a look at the bigger picture. \"I\\'ll be the first to say that the mercury is a potential problem,\" said Craig Lindsay, president of Western Mining Alliance. \"But when we\\'re looking at big, complex ecosystems, we need to be careful not to point fingers at just one factor.\" Lindsay said he and other miners have been pulling mercury out of the water long before government agencies took notice. He said he shares Singer\\'s concerns about flooding, but doesn\\'t believe the results are conclusive. \"If you have the flood of the millennium, yeah, there\\'s going to be a lot of mercury moved downstream -- that\\'s a given,\" Lindsay said. \"How that\\'s going to impact the ecosystem in the delta? That\\'s a more complex question.\" High above the delta in Sierra Gold Country, the Nevada Irrigation District has recently completed a pilot project that organizers hope could prevent such a scenario. For the past five years, Rem Scherzinger, general manager of the Nevada Irrigation District, has been working with his team on a program to dredge mercury-laden sediment from the Bear River and Lake Combie, both of which eventually flow into the delta. So far, it’s working. \"The pilot program has been completed with a success rate in the 90th percentile, so we know it’s possible on a small scale,\" Scherzinger said. \"We believe that it could be possible on a large scale, as well.\" But Singer expressed fears that remediation efforts alone are not realistic. \"This is certainly laudable, but it will be much more challenging to do that on a large scale ... this problem is massive,\" Singer said. \"The hills are steep and climate change is calling for flood-like conditions. The mercury is ubiquitous. All it takes is one big flood.\" California Mercury Water Contamination Will Worsen With Climate Change: Study',\n",

Last May, then-teammate Karlos Dansby said that Manziel had \"grown up right before our eyes,\" adding, \"He made a decision to help him be a better man [by going to treatment].

Manziel started just six games in 2015, and hours before the season finale, he was reportedly spotted partying in Las Vegas while wearing a disguise to avoid detection.

              "  'context': 'Clickbait. Nobody likes it, and yet it’s strangely irresistible. You kind of hate yourself after indulging in it, the Internet equivalent of being force-fed melted Jolly Ranchers by the spoonful. But as much as clickbait’s trickster headlines inspire self-loathing, it hardly compares to the amount of ill-will it engenders toward traffic-hungry, trigger-happy media outlets that think firing off lots of popcorny articles, shotgun-style, will net them a few extra ad impressions. Well, Facebook users are fed up with clickbait headlines, and they’re fighting back with one of the only tools at their disposal: the like button. For a while now, users have told Facebook in surveys they prefer headlines that spell out what’s contained in the story. That doesn’t stop them from clicking on stories that leave the news out of the title, though — and that\\'s reflected in the data Facebook gathers on its users, said Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management. \"If you measure just clicks, no, they\\'ll click more on things where you\\'re actually withholding things in the title,\" he said. \"But they\\'ll spend less time actually reading it once they click.\" That makes some amount of sense. But Mosseri continued: \"Another pattern we see is that they\\'ll like a story, click on it, and come back immediately because they feel deceived and un-like it. We do see that reflected in behavior.\" Facebook revealed how its News Feed displays content. This came in response after last month\\'s new report alleging liberal political bias in its Trending Topics feature. (Reuters) People who feel misled are actively going back to the News Feed and removing their likes from stories, according to Facebook. That\\'s significant. It\\'s an extra step, an act of commission, one that takes time and thought. And it\\'s an interesting way users who lack other means to voice their displeasure have devised as a kind of stop-gap measure for fighting back. It’s unclear how widespread this practice is, and Facebook declined to elaborate. But given the incredible importance that likes and engagement can have on the performance of a given article, it does suggest that there’s a limit to the traction publishers may get from clickbait. [Facebook will now let you manage what happens to your account after you die] Researchers who\\'ve investigated clickbait seem to have settled on a few theories as to why it works. The key finding is that clickbait headlines generate an emotional response that in many ways is out of our control. In one recent paper, computer scientists concluded after analyzing tens of thousands of headlines that the more intensely aligned a headline was toward a positive or negative emotion, the more likely it would be to produce a click. Clickbait also exploits the reward centers of our brains. As Wired wrote last year, you can \"think of that clickbait headline as a signal, an imminent sign you’re about to see some super-adorbz animal buddies. ... You might assume our brains get that wonderful squirt of dopamine after we get the reward (the pics), but it turns out dopamine levels go up much sooner.\" In fact, the mere sight of a clickbait headline is enough to trigger the release of happy chemicals, psychologists have found. In light of that research, it makes total sense why you might be outraged by an article that didn\\'t produce the expected reward. The feeling, too, that you\\'ve been manipulated or cheated by some process you\\'re helpless to resist only heightens the resentment. And to hear that some users are taking back their likes shows how little power they have to express themselves and force the system to change. Facebook has periodically taken steps to address clickbait. In 2014, it tweaked its algorithm over concerns that those types of articles could \"drown out\" other types of content. It did so again earlier this year to prioritize stories that the company thought people actually wanted to read. In both moves, an important metric Facebook considered was the amount of time users spent, or were expected to spend, on a given story — the idea being that the longer you take before coming back to Facebook, the likelier it is that you found the content meaningful and worth your time. [New data: Americans are abandoning wired home Internet] This week\\'s News Feed tweak seems consistent with that approach. Although it doesn\\'t single out clickbait by name, Facebook is saying it doesn\\'t want publishers to basically take over the News Feed with their many, many attempts at attracting readers. Everyone’s definition of clickbait is a little different. Here’s how The Washington Post’s executive editor, Marty Baron, described it to New York Magazine: The way I would define it is, it has a headline that tries to trick you to read the story and when you get to the story there’s nothing of any substance. Of course, many substantive news stories now are written with webby, social-media-friendly headlines, too. That’s by design, in a world where even actual news is forced to compete with cat listicles and Disney-princess personality quizzes. The results are clear: Clicky headlines attract readers. The responsibility of journalists is to make sure there’s something worth reading on the other side. Facebook users are rebelling against clickbait with one of the only tools they have',\n",

              "  'context': 'DC Comics/Nicola Scott DC Comics has taken the groundbreaking step to confirm what many already suspected. Wonder Woman is queer, and she always has been. In an interview with Comicosity , writer Greg Rucka confirmed the long-overdue announcement about the superhero, otherwise known as Diana of Themyscira. But it doesn’t come entirely as a surprise to comic fans, given that Wonder Woman’s island home, Themyscira, is inhabited only by women. Warner Bros. Pictures Rucka said the decision to depict the character as such was only ‘logical’: It’s supposed to be paradise. You’re supposed to be able to live happily. You’re supposed to be able – in a context where one can live happily, and part of what an individual needs for that happiness is to have a partner – to have a fulfilling, romantic and sexual relationship. And the only options are women. But an Amazon doesn’t look at another Amazon and say, ‘You’re gay.’ They don’t. The concept doesn’t exist. Establishing a queer identity for Wonder Woman is part of the comic’s efforts to offer the character a new dimension, Digital Spy reports. The confirmation also avoids falling back on the idea that she left Themyscira to chase after love interest Steve Trevor. Warner Bros. Pictures Rucka explained: [Defining her as queer] needs to be yes for a number of reasons. But perhaps foremost among them is, if no, then she leaves paradise only because of a potential romantic relationship with Steve. And that diminishes her character. It would hurt the character and take away her heroism. And people love it: Rucka added he was surprised that Wonder Woman’s bisexuality was still under question when it was hinted at in some instalments of her story. I don’t know how much clearer I can make it. It doesn’t matter if I say, ‘Yes, she’s queer.’ Or ‘No, she’s not queer.’ It matters what you get out of the book. Can you find it? Is it there?

              "  'context': 'Improving your diet often suggests a daunting revamp of every food you eat, but changing just one thing will help you lose weight and get significantly healthier, finds a new study in the Annals of Internal Medicine . A group of researchers from the University of Massachusetts Medical School zeroed in on fiber, since previous studies have shown it can help people feel more full, eat less and improve some metabolic markers like blood pressure, cholesterol levels and blood sugar. They recruited 240 people who showed signs of prediabetes and randomly assigned them to the American Heart Association (AHA) diet , which is currently recommended for those at risk of developing diabetes, or to eating more fiber. The AHA group focused on decreasing their daily calorie intake in order to lose weight, and they were provided with goals to limit saturated fat. The fiber group was simply asked to eat more foods rich in fiber, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, to reach a quota of at least 30 grams of fiber per day. Neither group was told to change their exercise habits. After a year, both groups lost about the same amount of weight. Even more surprisingly, the people in the study also showed similar drops in cholesterol levels, blood pressure, blood sugar and inflammation. \"By changing one thing, people in the fiber group were able to improve their diet and lose weight and improve their overall markers for metabolic syndrome,\" says study author Dr. Yunsheng Ma. While he’s not yet ready to say that people at risk of developing diabetes should ditch the AHA diet and focus just on eating more fiber, Ma\\'s study does suggest an alternative way of getting healthier. \"I think we have to change the paradigm about recommendations,\" he says. \"Telling people to reduce this or reduce that is just too hard to do.\" Ma notes that while dietary guidelines to lower the risk of various diseases have been around for decades, obesity, heart problems and diabetes remain the most common conditions affecting Americans. \"Very few people reach the goals that are recommended,\" he says. Asking them to focus on eating more of a certain food—rather than telling them what not to eat—may help people to think more positively about changes in their diet, and make the goals more achievable. From there, it might be easier to make the other changes, such as those included in the AHA diet. \"[Adding fiber] might be one new idea for how to get people to adhere to a diet,\" he says.

However, that it was finally revealed that Trump failed to make good on the $6 million pledge has opened up a whole new can of worms. And my apologies to actual worms. In response to the Washington Post’s revelation that Trump never made good on his pledge, VoteVets, a huge progressive veterans group, had some words for Trump. Donald Trump is a cheap fraud,\" said Iraq veteran and VoteVets chairman Jon Soltz in a scathing press release. \"In a classic fraud move, made himself look good to the public, by lying to the American people, and veterans, about how much he raised for veterans’ groups, when he hid behind them to get out of the GOP debate.

The whole thing was just a PR stunt to shield him from having to deal with Fox News’ Megyn Kelley. PR, of course, is one thing that Donald Trump knows something about.

We now need to presume that he is lying about how much he claims he has given to veterans over the years, and that’s part of the reason he won’t release his taxes,\" Soltz continued. \"Releasing them would likely show that he’s not given as much to veterans’ groups over the years as he claims – if he’s even given to them at all. Another lie and another fraud. And still under the mistaken belief that presidential candidates are never to be held accountable, Trump told the Post last month, \"Why should I give you records?

The concept of mindful eating is nothing new - for years, health gurus have extolled the virtues of appreciating your food instead of mindlessly shoving it into your mouth. Studies have shown that eating mindfully results in weightloss with minimal effort, but just how exactly do you do it? One expert has revealed her tried and tested technique to help us eat mindfully - it’s called \\'the sultana exercise\\'. According to Charlotte Thaarup, Australian clinical mindfulness consultant and director of The Mindfulness Clinic, doing this single exercise with a sultana is all we need to do to keep us eating consciously. According to Thaarup, the sultana exercise could help you eat better and binge less, the Mail Online reports. Mindful eating has for a while been touted as a way to help people re-establish a healthy relationship with food. \"Whether you want to lose weight, call a truce in the war with your dear body, change your relationship with food, or reduce your daily stress by making healthier choices,\" Thaarup says eating mindfully can help. For a lot of people, however, eating mindfully becomes harder when dining with other people - it’s hard to pay attention to what your companions are saying if you’re also focussing on every mouthful you chew. But if you can manage it, mindful eating really could be the easiest way of all not only to stop overeating but also to get more pleasure from food. One study, for example, found that people who ate chocolate mindfully were left in a better mood than those who didn’t bother to really enjoy it.

Specifically, they state \"People familiar with the development plans said Nintendo would likely include both a console and at least one mobile unit that could either be used in conjunction with the console or taken on the road for separate use.\" Based on this, it looks very likely that the Nintendo NX could have combined console and handheld game development. Combining handheld and console development makes sense as the 8th Generation has been plagued with software droughts for Nintendo. As Satoru Iwata stated during a financial briefing \"Wii U has lost momentum due to the release pace of software titles after the launch period.\" While Nintendo had a good amount of games planned for 2013, the majority of them didn’t launch until later in the year . Of course, it doesn’t help that those games didn’t get much of a foothold. As a result, Wii U sales went from 3.45 million in the 2012 fiscal year to 2.72 million in the 2013 fiscal year. Moreover, Nintendo has been making the same game over and over. There is a Mario Kart for the Wii U and 3DS. There is a New Super Mario Bros for the Wii U and 3DS. There is Smash Bros for Wii U and 3DS. Most of Nintendo’s efficiency has been wasted on making a version for each console. Yet if they don’t do this, some series get left out in the cold. For example, there was a traditional Animal Crossing game for the 3DS, but not for the WIi U. Having two system that both need games has stretched Nintendo thin. Nintendo was able to produce a plethora of games with the Wii because it didn’t follow the HD trend of its competitors. With the Wii U, Nintendo struggled makings HD games with Shigeru Miyamoto stating \"We may have underestimated the scale of this change and as a result, the overall software development took more time than originally anticipated just as we tried to polish the software at the completion phase of development... \". Now, Nintendo can have a tidal wave of software titles right out of the gate. As Sean Malstrom states on his blog \"...instead of two pipelines to make games, there will be only one big pipeline. NX could have double or triple the first party software that the Wii U had. This is necessary for NX to go anywhere.\" If Nintendo’s strategy is to really focus on one system, then that system could have a ton of games. How Many Games Will There Be? So that brings us to the ultimate question: Just how many games will the NX have?? To answer this, I took a look back at the last 5 years from 2011 to 2015 to see how many games Nintendo and their internal development teams (Intelligent Systems, NdCube, Retro Studios and Monolith Studios) had created. These years were chosen as they would be the best representative for the NX because the NX will most likely be an HD system and the Wii was made to be a weaker system compared to Nintendo’s rivals. Also, these are the most recent years and should be more representative of current game development cycles. I took a few other assumptions into account as well: I included the Legend of Zelda remakes on the 3DS. Although Grezzo was behind them, Nintendo still assisted in development of them. See here and here . Although Monolith worked on Project X Zone, I didn’t include that title or its sequel in this list. This list does not include Super Smash Bros for Wii U and 3DS , Kid Icarus Uprising , and Pokemon games. It does not include games made by second-party developers, such as Next Level Games and HAL Laboratories. This list only includes full retail games. The data is based on Japanese release dates. Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total # of games 9 7 8 5 11 40 Games included above 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Mario Kart 7 Animal Crossing: New Leaf Fire Emblem Awakening Legend of Zelda: Link Between Worlds Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer Nintendogs + Cats Brain Age: Concentration Training Tomodachi Life Mario Party Island Tour Codename: S.T.E.A.M.

This would mean, on average, Nintendo releases a game every month and a half (and this isn’t including second party games). The variance (standard deviation) is approximately 2, meaning a year could have upwards of 10 games.[1] Based on this information, it’s safe to say that the NX will have about 8 games throughout 2017. Most likely, the system will have 3-4 games available immediately at launch, another 3 to 4 titles released towards the end of the year. That said 2017 could have more games since new Nintendo games in 2016 are few and far between. The only games coming out during 2016 from Nintendo and its internal developers are Starfox Zero and Starfox Guard, Mario Party Star Rush, and Paper Mario Color Splash. As such, it’s very possible that 2017 could have upwards of 10 games coming from Nintendo as they gear up for the launch of the NX. In a Investor Q&A, Kimishima stated \"One of the reasons for choosing the launch timing that we did is so that the software lineup will be ready in time for the hardware launch.\" Interestingly, Kimishima mentions \"software library\" implying Nintendo is gearing up a software library. Given the assessment above, Nintendo could have a plenty of titles ready and the delay could very well be to polish titles and line up the library to avoid software droughts. In total, Nintendo had 39 games during the 5 year period, so whythe heck did the Wii U and 3DS have such software droughts? With a game released every month or two, you’d think the Wii U would have had plenty of games (especially as this list excludes some games). The problem was two fold. First, game development comes in cycles. 2012 and 2014 were very light on games where as 2013 and 2011 had plenty of games. A game takes about two to three years to complete, so there will be dry years. So 2014, for instance, only had two Wii U games: Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. The second issue, as mentioned above, was that Nintendo had to make games for two seperate system. Even worse is that, in order to maximize the selling power of their best franchises, like Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart, and of course Super Mario, Nintendo had to develop a title for both their handheld and console. As a result, Nintendo can’t give attention to their smaller series. Did you ever wonder why Nintendo isn’t making more F-Zero titles? Well, they have to make two Mario Kart games. There just isn’t enough time. Developing on a single system is a win/win for Nintendo. In the weak years (like 2012 and 2014 above), the drought will be alleviated by second-party titles and, hopefully, third-party titles. Although 2014 was a light year for Nintendo, it saw the release of Super Smash Bros for Wii U and 3DS, Pokemon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, Hyrule Warriors, Kirby Triple Deluxe, Mario Golf World Tour, and Pokemon Art Academy. On the other hand, there is a torrent of new software in the strong years (like 2013 and 2015). Before even considering new second-party titles, 2013 and 2015 had eight and eleven titles, respectively. \"But wasn’t 2013 a bad year for Nintendo?\" It was, and some of Nintendo’s sleeper hits for that year actually appeared on the 3DS: Fire Emblem Awakening and Tomodachi Life. Even though the goal was to bulk up the Wii U’s library, Nintendo still had to work on the 3DS as well. Even worse is that both of these titles were released during the first half of 2013 when the Wii U’s drought was at its worse. Although 2015 saw a lot of titles as well, only five of the eleven titles were released on the Wii U. Ultimately, the biggest problem with trying to support two systems is that one flourishes while the other struggles. What Games Will Be On the Nintendo NX? Once we think about how many games are available on the system, we naturally think about what those titles will be. So far, the only game confirmed for the NX will be The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Beyond that, it’s all speculation, but we have some good guesses. Miyamoto has confirmed that Pikmin 4 is nearing the end of development. There have also been a rumors from every corner of the internet suggestion ports of Wii U games, such as Super Smash Bros, will come to the NX. I have also written on why I believe the next Smash will come sooner rather than later. Beyond that, Mario Kart is a very real possibility. Mario Kart games come out roughly every two to three years, and the Mario Kart 8 came out two years ago. Retro Studios has also been working on a new game. What that title is is anyone’ guess. Will it be a new series? Metroid? Or perhaps they will tackle another Nintendo IP the company hasn’t touched, such as F-Zero. All of these could be real possibilities. If you want to know more, check out Nantendo’s Road to the NX. It remains ones of the best assessments of Nintendo internal development teams. Closing Nintendo executives have routinely discussed the fact that the NX is a system with a new concept. Based on the rumblings we’ve gotten from Nintendo, it could very well be a combined handheld and console system. If that is true, we could see a huge stream of Nintendo games released for the system, approximately 8 a year (not including second-party titles). Time will only tell what the NX will really be, but needless to say, there is a plenty to be excited about. [1] – Actual standard deviation was 2.24 Like this: Like Loading...

              "  'context': 'Columbia, South Carolina has decided to rescind its controversial decision to criminalize homelessness after facing major backlash from police, city workers and advocates. Columbia’s city council decided on Tuesday to reverse its unanimous vote that would have given homeless people the choice to either go to a remote shelter or get arrested, according to the Free Times. The council apologized, backtracked on its decision and said it would give homeless people the option to go to the shelter, but would not force them to. \"I will take responsibility for that getting into the public discourse,\" Councilman Cameron Runyan said on Tuesday about his suggestion to force homeless people into confinement, according to the Free Times. \"That is not the desire...We are not going to forcibly confine anyone.\" Runyan’s softer stance is a far cry from his stern Aug. 13 declaration. Last month, after bemoaning the fact that Columbia’s Downtown area had become a \"magnet for homeless people,\" the council decided that it would make loitering and panhandling in the area illegal and it would make homeless people go to a 240-person bed shelter or go to prison. The measure would have required additional police to round up homeless people and to stand guard at the facility to make sure that no one left without permission. But even the members of the law enforcement who would have been needed to carry out the plan would not get on board. \"Homelessness is not a crime,\" Interim Police Chief Ruben Santiago told The State.\"We can’t just take people to somewhere they don’t want to go. I can’t do that. I won’t do that.\" After paying heed to the concerns of those who opposed the plan, the city council has revamped the approach to putting an end to homelessness. The city will dispense vans that will take people on the streets to the shelter, if they choose to go, and they will be able to stay there for a week before getting transferred to a more stable program that addresses their specific needs. The city will also install public bathrooms and garbage cans and will educate people about the city’s loitering and panhandling policies by putting up explicit signs, according to the Free Times. But the city council hasn’t smoothed out all of the program\\'s kinks. Runyan suggested using the homeless people’s food stamps, Social Security checks and other benefits to help pay to run the shelter, but some aren’t sure if that is legal. The shelter, which is poised to open at the end of the month, also doesn’t have kitchen facilities, so it’s still unclear how it will provide food to homeless people. Still, advocates felt bolstered by the council’s willingness to compromise. \"The city of Columbia, Christ Central Ministries and service providers recognize that meeting the challenge of homelessness and poverty requires a community response and that this is a ‘we’ challenge, not a ‘them’ challenge,\" Mayor Steve Benjamin said, according to the State, \"and never an effort to deprive any individuals of civil liberties or to criminalize poverty.\" Columbia, South Carolina Rescinds Decision To Criminalize Homelessness',\n",

              "  'context': 'Connecticut announced this week that it will become the fifth state in the U.S. to automatically register its citizens to vote. And it’s going to do so in an innovative way. While Oregon, California, West Virginia and Vermont have each passed laws through their state legislatures enacting automatic voter registration, the process in Connecticut was initiated by state agencies. The office of Connecticut Secretary of the State Denise Merrill (D) signed an administrative agreement with the state Department of Motor Vehicles to automatically register eligible voters by August 2018. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires states to give eligible voters the opportunity to register to vote when they renew their driver’s license or state identification card, or when they acquire a new one, at the DMV. Connecticut says it will transition to a system where eligible voters are registered automatically when they interact with the DMV. The state says up to 400,000 new voters could be registered through this process once the two agencies hammer out the details. \"It just makes sense that people shouldn\\'t have to go to two different places to do a state service. If you’re 18 and a citizen, it’s your right to vote,\" Merrill told The Huffington Post Tuesday. \"This makes interacting with the state government easier, for everyone.\" A memorandum of understanding between Merrill’s office and the DMV notes that the program may need funding from the state legislature. In other words, the program isn’t entirely circumventing Connecticut\\'s General Assembly, where Democrats control both chambers. An automatic registration bill failed to pass out of the legislature in the latest session. Shifting the burden of registration from the voter to the state is a popular concept among progressives -- including President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) -- but it turned into a bipartisan cause in West Virginia, which in March became the first state with a GOP-controlled legislature to pass an automatic voter registration bill. Voting rights advocates say automatic registration can save money for states and is more secure than traditional methods, especially in states that don\\'t offer online registration: State agencies transfer data on eligible voters between them, rather than entering data from paper registration forms, which can lead to errors. Still, J.R. Romano, the chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party, questioned whether the agencies will be able to implement automatic voter registration properly. He pointed out that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the Connecticut DMV for failing to comply with the NVRA. \"I’m all for voter participation,\" Romano told HuffPost. \"The issue is that the current leadership in this state is more focused on trying to grab positive headlines versus actually accomplishing anything.\" \"I appreciate the attempt, but everything they have attempted to do is an utter failure,\" he went on. \"We do have undocumented people with licenses, so if they’re using the DMV, how are they going to ensure that actual citizens are registering to vote?\" Since the DMV is already overhauling its registration system in response to the threat of a lawsuit from the DOJ, Merrill argued that now is the perfect time to initiate automatic voter registration. Indeed, the effort may convince the DOJ that a lawsuit against the state isn’t necessary. \"I wouldn’t want to speculate, but certainly Connecticut has been in the forefront of making voter registration easier, more efficient,\" Merrill said. \"I think that if we can show that these measures that we are taking will improve our performance, it may help.\" In Oregon, the state automatically registers eligible voters who visit the DMV by sending them a postcard that offers them the choice to either opt out or register with a particular party. If an eligible voter does not return the postcard, he or she is registered as an unaffiliated voter. The program has already been a huge success: More than 51,000 Oregonians have been added to the voter rolls through automatic voter registration since it launched in January. That\\'s three times as many new registrations compared to the prior rate received through the DMV in the last presidential election. Connecticut is considering various possibilities for how to allow eligible voters to opt out of registration if they prefer. One option would be to have them sign a form while they’re at the DMV indicating that they do not want to be added to the voter rolls.

              "  'context': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — A sobering portrait of less-educated middle-age white Americans emerged Thursday with new research showing them dying disproportionately from what one expert calls \"deaths of despair\"—suicides, drug overdoses and alcohol-related diseases. The new paper by two Princeton University economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, concludes that the trend is driven by the loss of steady middle-income jobs for those with a high school diploma or less. The economists also argue that dwindling job opportunities have triggered broader problems for this group. They are more likely than their college-educated counterparts, for example, to be unemployed, unmarried or suffering from poor health. \"This is a story of the collapse of the white working class,\" Deaton said in an interview. \"The labor market has very much turned against them.\" Those dynamics helped fuel the rise of President Donald Trump, who won widespread support among whites with only a high school diploma. Yet Deaton said his policies are unlikely to reverse these trends, particularly the health care legislation now before the House that Trump is championing. That bill would lead to higher premiums for older Americans, the Congressional Budget Office has found. \"The policies that you see, seem almost perfectly designed to hurt the very people who voted for him,\" Deaton said. Case and Deaton’s paper, issued by the Brookings Institution, follows up on research they released in 2015 that first documented a sharp increase in mortality among middle-aged whites. Since 1999, white men and women ages 45 through 54 have endured a sharp increase in \"deaths of despair,\" Case and Deaton found in their earlier work. These include suicides, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related deaths such as liver failure. In the paper released Thursday, Case and Deaton draw a clearer relationship between rising death rates and changes in the job market since the 1970s. They find that men without college degrees are less likely to receive rising incomes over time, a trend \"consistent with men moving to lower and lower skilled jobs.\" Other research has found that Americans with only high school diplomas are less likely to get married or purchase a home and more likely to get divorced if they do marry. \"It’s not just their careers that have gone down the tubes, but their marriage prospects, their ability to raise children,\" said Deaton, who won the Nobel prize in economics in 2015 for his long-standing work on solutions to poverty. \"That’s the kind of thing that can lead people to despair.\" The issues identified by Case and Deaton are likely contributing to a slight reversal in a decades-long trend of improving life-expectancy data. It’s not entirely clear why these trends have affected whites much more than they have African-Americans or Hispanics, whose death rates are improving. Case and Deaton note that many Hispanics are \"markedly better off\" than parents or grandparents who were born abroad, enabling a greater sense of optimism. African-Americans, they add, may have become more resilient to economic challenges given their long-standing disadvantages in the job market. Other researchers have said that whites may have an easier time obtaining painkillers that are behind an epidemic of drug overdoses. The data is clear, though: In 1999, the death rate for high school-educated whites ages 50 through 54 was 30 percent lower than the death rate for all African-Americans in that age group. By 2015, it was 30 percent higher. The educational split is also growing. Even while the death rate for whites without a college degree is rising, the rate for whites who are college graduates is falling, Case and Deaton found. The trends cut across diverse regions of the country, the researchers found. While the worst-hit spots include Appalachian states such as West Virginia and Kentucky, they also include such areas as Maine, Baltimore and eastern Washington state. The patterns are evident in rural sections and smaller cities as well as in some large metro areas, the research found. Americans with less education are also faring much worse when compared with adults in other countries, Case and Deaton concluded. Death rates in Europe for people with limited education are falling — and in most countries, they’re falling faster than death rates for those with more education. For those reasons, Case and Deaton discount the notion that government disability benefit programs are responsible for some of these problems by enabling more Americans to stop working. Social welfare programs in Europe are typically more generous yet haven’t caused a rise in death rates. Given the long-running nature of these trends, many of which stem from the 1970s, reversing them could take years, Case and Deaton write. But there are immediate steps that could be taken, Deaton said in the interview. Routine prescriptions for opioids should be cut back. And, \"Europe has a much better safety net than we do, and they’re not seeing the same sort of problems as we are,\" he said.

              "  'context': 'The average person sleeps for around eight hours a day. Over a lifetime this amounts to spending about one third of life asleep. It’s common knowledge that a good nights rest is vitally important for maintaining health and balance, both mentally and physically. However, for some people a good night’s sleep is hard to come by, or it ends up being ruined, by a strange phenomenon that is called sleep paralysis. It happens when your mind wakes up before your body ever gets a chance to. You can breathe normally, you can see and understand everything around you, but you can’t move a muscle no matter how hard you try. The feelings that run through your mind when sleep paralysis occurs are overwhelming and the whole experience can be summed up as terrifying. Many people report that right before waking they hear a loud bang or waves crashing in their head which suddenly jars them awake. Others report that they do in fact have difficulty breathing and that it feels as if someone were choking them. These moments can last from a few seconds to several minutes or longer and most commonly show up initially during one’s teenage years. The sensation of waking up and not being able to move is thought to affect less than 8% of the general population. There are no serious risks attributed to sleep paralysis on its own, medically speaking, rather the mental and physical damage may occur in the long run. While there may be genetic factors that contribute to it, the main causes are thought to be a lack of sleep, schedule changes, and sleeping on ones back. Back in earlier times it used to be thought that demons or evil forces were behind the strange phenomenon and it’s easy to see why. Here are 8 terrifying facts about it: 1) No one knows for sure what causes it- Science and researchers have yet to find a definitive cause or explanation as to what may trigger it. It has been a mystery for thousands of years and to this day it remains one. 2) It feels like you’re dead- Many people equate the experience of waking up and being unable to move, while fully mentally awake, to feeling like they’re dead. Basically, it’s a type of out of body experience that you never want to experience. 3) It can happen when you’re trying to fall asleep- It doesn’t only occur when you wake up. It can occur at two points in the sleep cycle when your body transitions between going into, and coming out of, the REM (deep sleep) stage. 4) If you suffer from a lack of sleep it’s more likely to happen to you- Studies have indicated that individuals who suffer from chronic sleep issues, and who routinely don’t get enough sleep, are more likely to have an episode of sleep paralysis than their well-rested counterparts. 5) Your nightmare may continue- A lot of people have reported that they feel like they’re in a living nightmare even after they wake up because they open their eyes and see hallucinations. They are mentally alert and know they are awake, but their minds and eyes see things that aren’t there, and it’s all too freakishly real. 6) It can feel like a demon is sitting on your chest- A common description given of what it feels like is that there is something heavy and bothersome weighing on your chest. Yikes! 7) There is no way to wake your body up- You literally have to wait for your body to snap out if it. No cough or blink will wake you, contrary to some beliefs. 8) It can happen to anybody– You may have already experienced it at some point in your life, not everyone is aware that it happened, and practically everyone will go through it at least once over the course of their lifetime.

              "  'context': 'When you\\'re living a distracted life, every minute must be accounted for. You feel like you must be checking something off the list, staring at a screen, or rushing off to the next destination. And no matter how many ways you divide your time and attention, no matter how many duties you try and multi-task, there\\'s never enough time in a day to ever catch up. That was my life for two frantic years. My thoughts and actions were controlled by electronic notifications, ring tones, and jam-packed agendas. And although every fiber of my inner drill sergeant wanted to be on time to every activity on my overcommitted schedule, I wasn\\'t. You see, six years ago I was blessed with a laid-back, carefree, stop-and-smell-the roses type of child. When I needed to be out the door, she was taking her sweet time picking out a purse and a glittery crown. When I needed to be somewhere five minutes ago, she insisted on buckling her stuffed animal into a car seat. When I needed to grab a quick lunch at Subway, she\\'d stop to speak to the elderly woman who looked like her grandma. When I had 30 minutes to get in a run, she wanted me to stop the stroller and pet every dog we passed. When I had a full agenda that started at 6:00 a.m., she asked to crack the eggs and stir them ever so gently. My carefree child was a gift to my Type A, task-driven nature --but I didn\\'t see it. Oh no, when you live life distracted, you have tunnel vision -- only looking ahead to what\\'s next on the agenda. And anything that cannot be checked off the list is a waste of time. Whenever my child caused me to deviate from my master schedule, I thought to myself, \"We don\\'t have time for this.\" Consequently, the two words I most commonly spoke to my little lover of life were: \"Hurry up.\" I started my sentences with it. Hurry up, we\\'re gonna be late. I ended sentences with it. We\\'re going to miss everything if you don\\'t hurry up. I started my day with it. Hurry up and eat your breakfast. Hurry up and get dressed. I ended my day with it. Hurry up and brush your teeth. Hurry up and get in bed. And although the words \"hurry up\" did little if nothing to increase my child\\'s speed, I said them anyway. Maybe even more than the words, \"I love you.\" The truth hurts, but the truth heals... and brings me closer to the parent I want to be. Then one fateful day, things changed. We\\'d just picked my older daughter up from kindergarten and were getting out of the car. Not going fast enough for her liking, my older daughter said to her little sister, \"You are so slow.\" And when she crossed her arms and let out an exasperated sigh, I saw myself -- and it was a gut-wrenching sight. I was a bully who pushed and pressured and hurried a small child who simply wanted to enjoy life. My eyes were opened; I saw with clarity the damage my hurried existence was doing to both of my children. Although my voice trembled, I looked into my small child\\'s eyes and said, \"I am so sorry I have been making you hurry. I love that you take your time, and I want to be more like you.\" Both my daughters looked equally surprised by my painful admission, but my younger daughter\\'s face held the unmistakable glow of validation and acceptance. \"I promise to be more patient from now on,\" I said as I hugged my curly-haired child who was now beaming at her mother\\'s newfound promise. It was pretty easy to banish \"hurry up\" from my vocabulary. What was not so easy was acquiring the patience to wait on my leisurely child. To help us both, I began giving her a little more time to prepare if we had to go somewhere. And sometimes, even then, we were still late. Those were the times I assured myself that I will be late only for a few years, if that, while she is young. When my daughter and I took walks or went to the store, I allowed her to set the pace. And when she stopped to admire something, I would push thoughts of my agenda out of my head and simply observe her. I witnessed expressions on her face that I\\'d never seen before. I studied dimples on her hands and the way her eyes crinkled up when she smiled. I saw the way other people responded to her stopping to take time to talk to them. I saw the way she spotted the interesting bugs and pretty flowers. She was a Noticer, and I quickly learned that The Noticers of the world are rare and beautiful gifts. That\\'s when I finally realized she was a gift to my frenzied soul. My promise to slow down was made almost three years ago, at the same time I began my journey to let go of daily distraction and grasp what matters in life. And living at a slower pace still takes a concerted effort. My younger daughter is my living reminder of why I must keep trying. In fact, the other day, she reminded me once again. The two of us had taken a bike ride to a sno-cone shack while on vacation. After purchasing a cool treat for my daughter, she sat down at a picnic table delightedly admiring the icy tower she held in her hand. Suddenly a look of worry came across her face. \"Do I have to rush, Mama?\" I could have cried. Perhaps the scars of a hurried life don\\'t ever completely disappear, I thought sadly. As my child looked up at me waiting to know if she could take her time, I knew I had a choice. I could sit there in sorrow thinking about the number of times I rushed my child through life... or I could celebrate the fact that today I\\'m trying to do thing differently. I chose to live in today. \"You don\\'t have to rush. Just take your time,\" I said gently. Her whole face instantly brightened and her shoulders relaxed. And so we sat side-by-side talking about things that ukulele-playing-6-year-olds talk about. There were even moments when we sat in silence just smiling at each other and admiring the sights and sounds around us. I thought my child was going to eat the whole darn thing -- but when she got to the last bite, she held out a spoonful of ice crystals and sweet juice for me. \"I saved the last bite for you, Mama,\" my daughter said proudly. As I let the icy goodness quench my thirst, I realized I just got the deal of a lifetime. I gave my child a little time... and in return, she gave me her last bite and reminded me that things taste sweeter and love comes easier when you stop rushing through life. Whether it\\'s ... Sno-cone eating Flower picking Seatbelt buckling Egg cracking Seashell finding Ladybug watching Sidewalk strolling I will not say, \"We don\\'t have time for this.\" Because that is basically saying, \"We don\\'t have time to live.\" Pausing to delight in the simple joys of everyday life is the only way to truly live.

But Radtke found herself fixating on her own health, on the particularities of the gene mutation that ran in her family, on the heart palpitations she sometimes got, and on death more generally ― the way it’s acknowledged, celebrated or ignored in different societies. The resulting story ― part travelogue, part memoir ― is told in Radtke’s book Imagine Wanting Only This, out this month.

We can convey certain things to the reader very quickly — the age of a character, the way she may change through time, the particular and specific elements of place.\" \"Plotting and structure is the hardest part of any project for me,\" she continued. \"In the end it all feels like magic that it comes together at all.\"  Magic or not, Radtke’s book is enchanting.

              "  'context': 'SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 24 - Seeking to avoid a repeat of Facebook Inc\\'s much-maligned public debut, Twitter Inc revealed more modest ambitions, saying its initial offering would raise up to $1.6 billion and value the company at up to about $11 billion. The valuation was more conservative than the $15 billion some analysts had expected for the social media phenomenon, potentially attracting investors who might consider the money-losing company\\'s listing price a better deal, with room to rise. Twitter had signaled for weeks it would price its IPO modestly to avoid the sort of stock plummet that spoiled Facebook\\'s coming-out party. It said on Thursday it intends to sell 70 million shares between $17 and $20 apiece, raking in up to $1.4 billion for the company. If underwriters choose to sell an additional allotment of 10.5 million shares, the offer could raise as much as $1.6 billion. Twitter\\'s offering will be the most high-profile Internet IPO since Facebook\\'s May 2012 debut, when the social network giant\\'s shares fell below their offering price and did not recover until a year later. Still, the modest pricing doesn\\'t obscure questions about Twitter\\'s profitability. \"The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop,\" said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Weath Management. \"But in the end, even for $11 billion, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number? And it\\'s unclear that they\\'re going to be able to do that.\" At a roughly $11 billion valuation, Twitter would be worth more than Yelp Inc and AOL Inc combined, but only a fraction of tech giants like Google Inc and Apple Inc, worth $342 billion and $483 billion respectively. Facebook\\'s market value is now $128 billion. ROADSHOW RECKONING Twitter and its underwriters begin a two-week road show to woo investors next Monday in New York, with stops in Boston and the mid-Atlantic region before touching down in Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Denver, according to a source familiar with the offering. \"They\\'re trying to price this for a very strong IPO, ideally creating the conditions for a solid after-market,\" said Pivotal Research Group\\'s Brian Wieser, who valued the company at $19 billion. The company could choose to raise the price of the offering during that period as it gauges interest. Twitter is expected to set a final price on Nov. 6, according to a document reviewed by Reuters, suggesting that the stock could begin trading as early as Nov. 7. Sam Hamadeh of PrivCo, a private company research firm, said Twitter could raise the price range and also the amount of shares being sold. But, he added: \"Raising both the price and the size was Facebook\\'s fatal mistake.\" Twitter\\'s debut will cap seven years of explosive growth for an online messaging service that counts heads of state and major celebrities among its 230 million active users - but still operates at a loss. Twitter will sell roughly 13 percent of the company in the IPO and will have 544,696,816 shares outstanding after the offering. That figure could rise given the exercising of options, restricted stock units and the issuance of shares for compensation after the IPO. The company plans to list its stock under the \"TWTR\" symbol on the New York Stock Exchange. Among the biggest Twitter shareholders selling in the offering is Rizvi Traverse, a fund managed by secretive Connecticut-based investor Suhail Rizvi, who has quietly amassed a 17.9 percent stake in Twitter with the help of Silicon Valley investor Chris Sacca. Rizvi\\'s stake will fall to 15.6 percent of total shares outstanding after the sale. JP Morgan Chase, which obtained Twitter shares through Rizvi and Sacca, will see its stake fall to 9 percent from 10.3 percent. Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, the largest individual shareholder, will reduce his stake to 10.4 percent from 12 percent, while Chief Executive Dick Costolo will emerge with a 1.4 percent stake, compared with 1.6 percent currently. Co-founder Jack Dorsey will also sell shares, as will early venture capital investors Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures and Benchmark Capital. FRACTURED OWNERSHIP Because many early shareholders, including Williams, previously sold parts of their stake to other investors like Rizvi, Twitter\\'s relatively fractured ownership structure looks markedly different from the likes of Facebook and other tech companies dominated by their founders. When Facebook went public last year, founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg kept 57 percent of the company\\'s voting shares, thanks to a scheme that gave him twice the voting power of ordinary shareholders. Following Twitter\\'s IPO, Costolo will be under pressure to improve its money-making ability. The eight-year-old company more than doubled its third-quarter revenue to $168.6 million, but net losses widened to $64.6 million in the September quarter, it disclosed in a filing earlier this month. This month, Twitter secured a $1 billion credit line from its underwriters including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank. In recent months the company has aggressively introduced a number of new advertising products, including packages with broadcasters CBS and ESPN that show ads on TV and Twitter simultaneously for the fall TV season. Twitter has also sought to deepen its relationships with news organizations, which provide much of the content shared on the network. The company said Thursday that it hired NBC News digital executive Vivian Schiller as the head of news. Twitter Thinks It\\'s Worth $11 Billion',\n",

Trying to convince one to switch to Android is almost like trying to convince a Windows or OS X user to switch to Linux (the niche, techy PC operating system on which Android is in fact based). But Google is on the verge of striking a major blow in the ease-of-use wars: Project Abacus, Google\\'s plan to do away with smartphone passwords almost entirely. With Abacus, due to release in the next several months, Android devices will keep track of biometric markers like walking gate, typing patterns, the look of your face, your location and other things to build an up-to-the moment \"trust score\" — a degree of certainty that the person holding your phone is in fact you. Different apps will be able to set different trust score thresholds at which you can use them. This plan could largely kill the lock screen, finger presses, and other obstacles built into the current every day experience of phone use. In other words, it will make the average Android much more simple and easy to use than the average iPhone. Do I think that will be enough to unseat Apple\\'s throne atop the luxury phone mountain? No. But a huge majority of the world\\'s smartphone users already use Android devices. And as iPhones get less and less interesting compared to premium Galaxies and HTCs, Abacus is exactly the kind of standout feature that could cause buyers on the fence to flip.

Before you freak: We\\'re not talking about those same beer-chugging hiccups, but a painful, unrelenting, severe case of the hiccups that comes on out of nowhere, says neurologist Diana Greene-Chandos, MD, director of neuroscience critical care at Ohio State University\\'s Wexner Medical Center. These are hiccups so bad you just might bring yourself to the emergency room. When they truly are a sign of a stroke, if you\\'re paying really close attention to your body, you might also notice chest pain, all-over numbness, or a bit of blurred vision, but, Greene-Chandos says, the hiccups are often so severe, those other symptoms fly under the radar. Crazy, right? In fact, no one really knows about this whole hiccup thing. Greene-Chandos\\'s team recently polled 1,000 women and found just 10 percent knew hiccups can be a sign of stroke. (For more surprising health tips, get a free trial of Prevention + 12 bonus gifts here!) That\\'s bad news, especially since doctors probably aren\\'t in the know, either. When a woman shows up at the ER with uncontrollable hiccups and feels a little tingly, most hospital staffers don\\'t immediately think stroke, Greene-Chandos says. But every minute counts: Clot-busting meds work best when they\\'re administered within three hours. The sooner a woman (and her doctors!) can identify these female-specific signs, the better outcome she\\'s likely to have. Currently, stroke is the No. 5 cause of death in the US, according to the CDC, killing nearly 130,000 Americans each year. Speaking of every minute counting: You\\'ve probably heard of F.A.S.T. as it applies to stroke symptoms. Quick refresher: It stands for face drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty (the most common signs someone\\'s having a stroke), time to call 911 -- and it definitely still applies to women. Today, commit a few others to memory: hiccups, chest pain, whole-body numbness, and headaches, a set of women-only symptoms for which there isn\\'t a handy acronym -- yet. Hiccups are associated with a type of stroke that occurs in the back of the brain as opposed to the top, a type that is indeed more common in women. \"That probably has something to do with the hiccup component and how the strokes manifest themselves differently,\" Greene-Chandos says, but we don\\'t entirely know what\\'s going on. That doesn\\'t mean hiccups shouldn\\'t be on your radar, though. Sure, it could be terrible indigestion, she says, but tune in to what your body is telling you. If you notice some numbness, chest pain, or blurry vision along with those hiccups, don\\'t brush them off. Women are all too likely to ignore signs of a stroke. \"Women don\\'t think of it as a disease that involves them,\" Greene-Chandos says. But actually, 60 percent of deaths from stroke happen among women, she says. \"All my friends can tell you all about breast cancer, and it claims nowhere near as many lives.\" The Scary Thing Your Hiccups Could Mean',\n",

He isn\\'t the only tech entrepreneur who sees potential -- or money to be made -- in the bankrupt Motor City. That same day, Dorsey was also booked to speak at Techonomy Detroit, a spinoff of the startup-booster business conference founded by journalist David Kirkpatrick. Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert, Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (the former chairman of Gateway) also took the stage at Techonomy to declare that tech industry entrepreneurs can accelerate the city\\'s comeback. Twitter already opened a small office in Detroit last year, and a dozen startup companies (many bankrolled by Gilbert\\'s venture fund) have rented office space downtown. Some critics question the idea that small startups like these can really drive a recovery in a once industrial city that still struggles with intense unemployment, not to mention its $18 billion debt. But Dorsey believes entrepreneurship -- both online and traditional -- is the best way to help neighborhoods and cities. Tuesday night\\'s \"Let\\'s Talk\" forum featured four Square-wielding local small business owners -- a jam-maker, a boutique owner, a letterpress studio owner and a cupcake mogul-in-the-making, all of them women. They\\'re not the sort of entrepreneurs you\\'d necessarily expect to see sharing a stage with the chairman of Twitter. But Dorsey said the \"Let\\'s Talk\" series, which also recently visited his hometown of St. Louis, Mo., along with Oakland and Stockton in California, looks for just these kinds of small business owners to spotlight. \"There\\'s so much great energy in Silicon Valley and San Francisco around building a culture of mentorship and support for entrepreneurs,\" he said. \"We wanted to see if we could export that for every type of entrepreneur, not just tech entrepreneurs.\" Before the event began, Dorsey sat at a table in one of Pam Turkin\\'s Just Baked cupcake shops in downtown Detroit. Turkin is a Square user who has recently seen sales of her gourmet treats crack the $3 million threshold, putting her among the top 2.6 percent of female business owners in the country, according to Count Me In, a nonprofit resource for women entrepreneurs. \"I spend a lot of time telling other women that they\\'re able to take that risk,\" Turkin said. \"Just dive in, and if it doesn\\'t work, move onto the next thing.\" Turkin said she\\'s seen downtown Detroit\\'s business district become more vibrant in the three years since she opened her first cupcake shop. \"I talk about the city a lot here, locally, because there\\'s been such a stigma with moving downtown,\" she said. \"It\\'s been amazing for us. There\\'s a lot of action, and there\\'s a lot of energy.\" Ultimately, the man who founded Twitter believes brick-and-mortar businesses like Turkin\\'s will always be necessary, and especially in cities like Detroit. \"No matter how much of our life moves online or to technology, we\\'re always going to appreciate the neighborhood places that we go to and meet our friends,\" Dorsey said. The best technology will continue to \"point back\" to offline life, rather than trying to create a virtual replacement online. \"This is where we live, and if we focus on building this up more, everyone is the better for it,\" he said. \"And it tastes better,\" added Turkin.

No, not to mend fences, or ask how Mexico will pay for the fence he’s promising, but merely for a photo opp. Yep, Trump’s adviser told CNN he’s mainly going for the photo that will come out of his visit there. We already knew this was the reason, but to actually say it? That takes some brass ones. This is yet just another Trump campaign bluster that will blow through our news cycle as all the other ones have and Hurricane Trump will continue to make his way through this election. Hope is that after all is said and done in November, there won’t be too much damage to the nation and we can go on under a President Hillary Clinton.

              "  'context': 'Over the past few years, a lot of the advertising in the wireless space has involved the major players going back and forth over either network quality or price. In recent months, however -- even though Verizon (VZ) has clung to that tactic with its \"better matters\" campaign -- the two upstarts in the space, T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S), have pushed the idea that rough network parity has been achieved. Sprint has even started using Paul Marcarelli, the man who asked \"can you hear me now?\" for Verizon for years, in its latest commercials. In those ads he pushes the notion that the difference between the best network and the worst is only 1%. Verizon and maybe AT&T (T) might dispute those numbers, but it\\'s clear based on a Verizon and maybe AT&T (T) might dispute those numbers, but it\\'s clear based on a new study from Market Force Information that having the best network is not the only criteria for having satisfied customers. In fact, the survey of 8,600 consumers showed that value plays a big role in keeping people happy. Which carriers have the happiest customers? Market Force asked survey participants to rate their satisfaction with their primary wireless carrier and its services, as well as their likelihood to refer that brand to others. Those results were averaged to create what the research company calls the \"Composite Loyalty Index.\" The survey showed that of the four major full-service carriers, T-Mobile had the highest score, just beating second-place Verizon. And, as you might expect, T-Mobile CEO John Legere took to social media to celebrate the win tweeting \"No surprise here...guess who\\'s at the top. The #uncarrier. #WeWontStop.\" Perhaps most interestingly the research found that satisfaction levels are actually higher among people using non-contract carriers. In that category Consumer Cellular came in first followed by Cricket, StraightTalk, Metro PCS, Boost Mobile, TracFone, Virgin Mobile and U.S. Cellular. Why are non-contract companies better-liked? It\\'s important to note that many of the major non-contract brands are actually owned by the four major carriers. AT&T owns Cricket and Consumer Cellular operates on its network. T-Mobile owns Metro PCS while Sprint owns Boost Mobile. Market Force found that 62% of wireless customers have a contract, 33% do not,and 5% use pre-paid phones. \"We were intrigued to find that, for the most part, consumers are more delighted with non-contract wireless providers than with traditional, full-service carriers,\" said Market Force Chief Strategy Officer Cheryl Flink. \"This could be attributed to the fact that wireless users believe non-contract carriers provide a better perceived value to their customers based on factors like price, coverage, and flexibility to change plans.\" What sets the full-service carriers apart? Market Force found that T-Mobile customer are happiest with the value offered by the company as well as ease of changing plans and access to new cell phone technologies. The survey showed that those factors could outweigh the categories generally associated with network quality because T-Mobile actually came in last for frequency of dropped calls. Verizon easily led the network coverage category and Sprint came in at or near the bottom for every category. These results show that good customer service, clear plans, and decent pricing can cover up for deficiencies in other areas. Consumers don\\'t all forgive T-Mobile for not having as good a network as Verizon, but enough do to put it at the top of the overall rankings. That suggests that T-Mobile should grow as it improves its network and Verizon would do the same if it worked on being a little easier for consumers to work with.

Is it becoming unsafe to fly? Just the opposite, say analysts. As we move towards the second half of 2016, it\\'s shaping out to be one of the safest years in recent aviation history. \"We are ahead of the 10-year average with eight accidents and 167 fatalities compared to the average of 10 accidents and 205 fatalities,\" aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas, editor of Airlineratings.com , told CNN. Analyzing the data Experts say measuring the number of crashes or deaths alone isn\\'t an accurate way to determine safety. You also have to factor in the overall amount of aviation traffic. It cites Aviation-Safety.net data that tallies 16 air accidents with 560 fatalities -- below the 10-year average and an improvement on 2014 when there were 21 fatal accidents with 986 fatalities. \"Flashback 50 years and there were a staggering 87 crashes killing 1,597 when airlines carried only 141 million passengers -- 5% of today\\'s number,\" said the report. There were two high-profile air travel incidents in 2015. In March, an Airbus A320-211 operated by budget carrier Germanwings crashed into the French Alps killing all 150 people on board. It later transpired that pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was identified as having suicidal tendencies, had caused the crash deliberately. In October, 224 people were killed when a Russian Metrojet Airbus A321-231 broke apart shortly after takeoff from Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport in Egypt. The disaster was claimed as a bomb attack by terror group ISIS. Investigations are still ongoing, but initial intelligence reports also pointed the finger at terrorism.

It also examines airlines\\' operational histories, incident records and operational excellence. According to the site, 148 of the 407 airlines it surveyed have the top seven-star safety ranking, but almost 50 have just three stars or less. If an airline has a crash that involves the death of a passenger and/or crew members it will automatically lose a star from its safety-rating rankings. EgyptAir has a product safety rating of 5/7.

According to a study published in the Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry , nail-biting might just be indicative of... perfectionism?? Dr. Kieron O’Connor, author of the study, said \"We believe that individuals with these repetitive behaviors may be perfectionistic, meaning that they are unable to relax and to perform tasks at a normal pace. They are therefore prone to frustration, impatience, and dissatisfaction when they do not reach their goals.\" Basically, nail-biters aren\\'t trying to alleviate their nerves - they\\'re doing it out of frustration. The Study Researchers studied 48 participants, half of whom had repetitive behaviors like nail-biting. The participants filled out surveys designed to test their organizational behavior and emotional regulation. The nail-biters were identified as being organizational perfectionists, a personality type marked by a tendency to make detailed plans and overwork themselves, and they often become frustrated by a lack of activity. Nail-biting and other repetitive behaviors are just their way of releasing their pent-up energy. Impact Of The Study Nail-biting might seem relatively harmless, but it can cause some long-term damage. WebMD says that nail-biting can lead to infection, weak teeth, and deformed nails. These risks, along with how prevalent this behavior is, have made nail-biting one of the leading areas that psychotherapists work with their clients on. \"These findings suggest that individuals suffering from body-focused repetitive behaviors could benefit from treatments designed to reduce frustration and boredom and to modify perfectionist beliefs,\" said Sarah Roberts, who also helped author the study.

They can make you faster, they can save your life, or they can get you killed, even if you’re the star of a major car-centric action franchise, and even if you aren’t driving. (Spoiler alert: the driver dies too). Considering how important tires are, they aren’t given nearly enough credit in the media or in car-guy circles. Sure, every racer talks about tires, and a lot of canyon warriors will sit on top of the snake talking setup, but on the internet and in casual conversation with casual enthusiasts, tires are a dull topic. You certainly can’t brag about them on a forum the way you can with your upgraded turbo and fresh dyno chart. You have to go into the Grassroots Motorsports catalog, or to a very specific sub-genre to see a tire comparison test for your desired application, so most people just end up reading reviews on TireRack. Tires are a dull topic even when we’re actively shopping for tires. They have insanely complicated naming schemes like GoodRubber GoodGripper Pro XGV25, which makes them even harder to discuss than Infiniti’s current lineup. In all seriousness, I have a set of tires on my Mustang at the moment called \"Continental ContiForce Contact.\" That’s a real name under which a real set of tires is marketed. Most people don’t have the luxury of actually testing tires before they buy either, making decisions based on either anecdotal evidence, a roll of the dice, budget, or a combination of the three. Nevertheless, the four small patches of rubber connecting your two-ton manslaughter machine to your city’s lowest-priced asphalt are, if you ask me, the best way to improve your car, or, the quickest way to fuck it up, crash, and even die. Even if you should know better. And I’m going to give you one piece of advice—advice I learned the hard way, but not as hard as my friends Paul Walker—who would have celebrated his 43rd birthday this week—and Roger Rodas did. In November of 2012, I entered my modified C5 Corvette in the \"Optima Batteries Ultimate Street Car Invitational,\" a multi-discipline driving event held the day after SEMA ends in Las Vegas. [Disclaimer: I have done promotional work at events for Optima Batteries unrelated to this event or to my column at The Drive.] I could not have been less prepared for this event if I had left the car’s targa roof at home in the garage, which, by the way, I did. Think it never rains in Vegas? Never snows? Go there in a car without a roof. I guarantee both will happen. Though the car was, and is, in mostly good nick, with, at the time, around 25,000 miles on it. The engine makes 400 horsepower to the wheels with some mild bolt-on upgrades, and it has a Stoptech Big Brake kit, Pfadt coilover suspension, racing seats, harnesses, and more. All of it worked. The bad news? It also had six-year old Goodyear F1 Assymetric tires on it. They had less than 5,000 miles on them, so they looked nearly new. But looking new and gripping like new are two different propositions entirely. A tire, for those as unfamiliar with this concept as I was back then, does two things: it sticks to the road by nature of its rubber chemical compound, and it disperses water using the tread pattern cut into the tire. On a street tire, most people will notice their tread has worn down after several thousand miles of use and decide it’s time to get new tires. If it rains, the worn tread won’t disperse water as well and you will have poor wet-weather performance, and a tendency towards hydroplaning. With cars driven frequently, you will wear out your tread before you age-out your rubber, which is the problem I want to address. With collector cars, especially cars driven less than a few thousand miles a year, the problem is that while your tread may look good, the rubber is old and dry, and simply will not work properly. The chemical compounds in your tires will degrade over time, significantly reducing your available grip, or worse, blowing out a sidewall under load. With sport tires, colder weather and harsh weather will exacerbate this. In general, five years from date of manufacture (stamped on the tire) is about as old as you ever want to go in a car you plan to drive quickly. If that car (or the tires themselves) are stored in a climate-controlled facility under perfect conditions, maybe you could squeeze an extra year or two out of them. But the fact is, if you have a few cars, some maybe that you only drive a few times a year, replacing tires can easily become a dangerous afterthought.

              "  'context': '(CNN) Historians have long been fascinated with the behavior of Mary Todd Lincoln. She was one of the most interesting and polarizing first ladies of the 19th century: Her unusually stormy moods, coupled with rumors of delusions, constant headaches and pallor, have led historians to suggest that she was \"insane,\" \"hypochondriacal,\" \"menstrual\" and the \"female wild cat of the age.\" But a modern doctor and scholar, Dr. John Sotos, has a much more sympathetic take on her affliction. He believes she suffered from an ailment that probably would not have been diagnosed, an extremely common health problem in her time that is rare today. After researching his new book and publishing a study in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, Sotos wants to end the ailment argument once and for all. Sotos, who was a medical technical adviser for the TV show \"House M.D.,\" believes he has solved one of the great medical mysteries of American history. Mary Todd Lincoln, a paradox But before we share Sotos\\' professional medical opinion, you may be wondering why there is a debate about the health of a woman who hasn\\'t been to the doctor in 150 years. When it comes to her health, biographer Jean Baker describes her as \"the reverse of Teflon.\" \"Every medical diagnosis has been postulated about her, it runs the gamut from Lyme disease to chronic fatigue to diabetes,\" said Baker, an award-winning historian at Goucher College Historians also often described Lincoln with a kind of misogynistic dismissiveness, Baker noted, chalking her symptoms up to \"hysterical\" female problems. Sexism in the historical record aside, Lincoln is difficult to pin down because she seems to have two distinctly different personalities. As a young woman, friends described her as having a \"natural kindness of heart.\" She was well-educated, intensely intellectual and a gifted conversationalist at parties. As a partner, she was ambitious and politically astute, guiding her famously devoted husband, Abraham Lincoln, to become not merely the president but one of American history\\'s most important. But in the White House, she developed a bad rap for her terrible temper and sour disposition. Angry outbursts earned her the nickname \"the hellcat\" from the president\\'s assistant private secretary. And, as one historian put it , regularly \"she indulged in her orgies of buying things,\" like some kind of Victorian Imelda Marcos. It\\'s hard to blame anyone for needing at least a little retail therapy, if not becoming deeply depressed over her tragic public life. She lost not one but three sons in her lifetime. In the White House fishbowl, the press constantly hounded her, and vicious gossips mocked her unflattering gowns, portraying her as a Confederate spy or a Western hick. Her husband lived under constant threat, and she ultimately lost the love of her life when he was shot, sitting next to her, holding her hand in a theater as they watched a British farce about rube-ish Americans. Late in life, her remaining son had her forcibly committed to an asylum, a humiliation she endured for three months before friends could spring her. At her death, her doctor argued that society should not judge her harshly and chalked up her behavior to \"cerebral disease.\" But was it really mental illness that changed her personality so much? The medical record None of Lincoln\\'s primary medical records exists today, with the exception of limited notes doctors kept when she was forcibly institutionalized. That\\'s only four months of records. Without lab tests or DNA, which provides only limited detail, Sotos is left with about 100 historic sources, including 678 letters and photos from the time. In his book \"The Mary Lincoln Mind-Body Sourcebook,\" Sotos argues that that record is enough. For those who might question this practice -- and some scholars do take issue with any retrospective diagnosis of an historical figure -- Sotos writes, \"the amount of information in the historical record exceeds the amount a physician might collect in a 10-minute clinical visit -- a duration clearly sufficient to make many diagnosis.\" He argues that only one thing can account for the many disparate mental and physical symptoms he finds described in the letters. Sotos believes Lincoln suffered from pernicious anemia. The dreaded \\'Downton Abbey\\' disease Pernicious anemia , which doctors sometimes call PA, has all but disappeared in modern life and from most modern medical literature. Only \"Downton Abbey\" fans may recognize the disease as (spoiler alert) London doctors inaccurately diagnosed Lord Merton with it, initially causing much consternation. PA was a death sentence in the early 20th century, when the show took place, and was among the most common reasons for people to be hospitalized. In Lincoln\\'s time, it wasn\\'t even a diagnosis. According to Sotos\\' research, PA was not known in English-language medical literature until 1874, eight years before Lincoln\\'s death. Sotos argues that nearly all of Lincoln\\'s symptoms fit the description of PA as it progresses, if left untreated. A severe vitamin B12 deficiency causes PA. Your body needs B12 to make red blood cells and nerves and to keep DNA functioning properly. People sometimes don\\'t get enough because of their diet -- vegans are vulnerable -- or more often, the stomach wall stops making the chemical the body uses to absorb the vitamin from food. It was deadly because doctors didn\\'t know what caused it. No treatment surfaced until 1926, when three doctors -- George Whipple, George Minot and William Murphy -- demonstrated that PA patients who ate a half-pound of raw liver daily could be cured. It was such a big medical advance that the trio won the Nobel Prize in 1934. When B12 was finally isolated in 1948, it enabled scientists to create a shot that people can get once a month and stay healthy. PA, a slowly progressive disease, can account for the otherwise seemingly unconnected symptoms throughout Lincoln\\'s life that got worse as she aged, Sotos argues. Sotos lists Lincoln\\'s symptoms over 30 years, which match PA symptoms , including a regular pallor to her skin, fever, headaches, gait problems, abnormal sensations as if she were being stuck by needles, soreness to her mouth, swelling, shortness of breath and resting tachycardia. Psychologically, she started to show signs of hypervigilance, delusions and hallucinations, but all with a kind of perceived clarity. B12 deficiency shrinks the brain, leading to a significant decline in cognitive function, paranoia and hallucinations. As she got older, the energetic woman who loved to read could no longer see well, and toward the end she became so weak and tired, she could barely move. Eventually, no longer able to speak, she communicated by blinking. At her death, she was diagnosed with \"a slight apoplexy,\" which seems to match the description of other PA deaths at the time, Sotos argues. So what now? Sotos hopes that this diagnosis will help future scholars reassess this \"notoriously difficult-to-understand partner to one of the most consequential figures in world history.\" Biographer Baker isn\\'t totally sold. \"I think it is great that he walked out on this speculative length,\" she said. But she said Lincoln was a \"ball of fire,\" full of energy. However, as a progressive disease, PA may not sap someone\\'s energy right away. Recently discovered letters suggest that Lincoln may have been taking too much chloral hydrate for sleep problems, which could account for some of her mental problems, Baker said. Baker has said some scholarship suggests that Lincoln\\'s symptoms may have been related to spinal stenosis or diabetes. Sotos has argued that those diseases couldn\\'t totally account for her mental problems, but PA can be the cause of both mental and physical symptoms. Ultimately, Baker said, with so many symptoms described in these letters as being \"vague,\" they may be a good fit for many diagnosis. Sotos is convinced and says the diagnosis has changed his own opinion of Lincoln. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. He said he came across the first lady as he put together a book , \"The Physical Lincoln,\" a medical analysis of Abraham Lincoln. Back then, when he made headlines for diagnosing the president with a rare genetic disorder, MEN2B, his research about Mary Todd Lincoln left him a critic. \"I came away not liking her at all,\" he said.

Robertson had some stiff competition for the title, managing to beat out notorious homophobe Niall Ferguson; Rev. George Gebauer, who came under fire for refusing to baptize a lesbian couple; Scott Lively, who has single-handily taken credit for inspiring Russia\\'s anti-gay laws, and outspoken anti-gay adoption politician Winston McKenzie. So how did Robertson manage to claw his way to the top of the anti-gay totem pole this year? Let us count the ways: After inspiring hope in LGBT people everywhere by stating that he didn\\'t think identifying as transgender was a sin, Robertson went on to compare transgender people to his castrated horse. In addition, the anti-gay pundit has claimed that LGBT nondiscrimination ordinances will put Christians in jail, and stated that gays are just straight people who have \"forsaken God.\" And who could forget his desire for a \"vomit\" button on Facebook so he could express his feelings surrounding LGBT-related posts? Perhaps most notoriously of all, Robertson made the claim that gays with AIDS wear special rings in order to cut other individuals when shaking hands and infect them with the disease in August.

Area 51 is one of the most secret and heavily guarded military bases on the planet and home to much alien folklore. The curiosity reached a boiling point, and people demanded answers. Will we find Free Pokemon Cheats and Coins? Situated in the southern portion of Nevada, the base has long been considered one of the most mysterious U.S. Armed Forces establishments, with rumors suggesting it’s used to store alien lifeforms and build high-tech weaponry to fend off alien attacks. This all depends on the size of your tin foil hat, of course. The Extraterrestrial Highway is State Route 375 (SR 375) located in south-central Nevada in the United States. The area did indeed feature Pokemon team hunting grounds and also several gyms and Pokestops. We even found a Pokemon right at the back gate of the military base and several rare Pokemon features in the immediate surrounding area. We were shocked to find empty gyms. There were two completely empty gyms right outside the back gate of the base in the very small town of Rachel, NV. This town has been featured in movies such as Paul, Independence Day, and many others. At the time of this writing, Fraghero controls 8 pokemon gyms along the extraterrestrial highway leading up to Area 51 itself. We caught several types of Area 51 Pokemon Warning: Don’t try to do this, we were extremely careful and didn’t break any rules, not to mention our reporter is an ex-military veteran. We won’t be responsible if you end up being detained or worse. Here’s what we found along the Extraterrestrial Highway, and all the way to the Back Gate of Area 51: At the corner before you turn on to the highway there is an Alien Jerky Shop with multiple Pokestops The sign marking the start of the highway. There is also a gym and a Pokestop located here! We found this guy at this abandoned gas station: Just chilling in the middle of nowhere: You will see all kinds of weird stuff on the highway, and almost each one has a Pokestop: Once you get close to the main gate of the base, they block all mobile signal, but there was a bit of signal at the back gate, which we’ll cover below. The road to the main gate of Area 51: We out here Located right by the Main gate road: After the main base gate road, if you drive a few more miles down the road you get to the town of Rachel, NV. This town is home to the world famous Little A’Le’Inn, which has been featured in many movies (Paul, Independence Day, etc.) Located there were 3 gyms, and 5 Pokestops. To our shock and surprise, the gyms were completely empty. Little A’Le’Inn you stole our hearts. We stole your gyms. More empty gyms! Located around the town are several Pokestops and Pokemon: Located right by the town of Rachel is back gate road. This road leads to the back gate of Area 51. We were able to have mobile signal for the entire drive all the way up to the actual gate. Here’s a photo of the south gate: (We would post our own, but it’s illegal to photograph this area): Here’s a screenshot of our Pokemon Go app at the Back Gate of Area 51: (There’s Pokemon!) And again at night: On the drive home, we found a Pikachu nearby, at almost every power plant/station (Pikachus store energy in their red cheeks): We also found Charmanders at large truck stops/gas stations in the \"Diesel\" section. Area 51 definitely has a lot to offer for Pokemon Go Tricks players, but it would be stupid to venture out there without doing some extensive research prior to making a trip.

MetroCard bonuses will increase, from 5 percent to 11 percent, for riders who put at least $5.50 on a card. Additionally, E-ZPass tolls will go up 4 percent, while car drivers who use cash will see an increase between 6.7 percent and 10 percent.

The party’s nominee-to-be spent this day working to answer that question. Donald Trump and Indiana Governor Mike Pence, after meeting this morning in Indianapolis. Pence also appeared with Trump last night at a rally. GOV. MIKE PENCE (R), Indiana: We are ready to put a fighter, a builder, and a patriot in the Oval Office of the United States of America. We’re ready for Donald Trump to be our next president. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) JUDY WOODRUFF: Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions met with Trump today, too, as did former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. He had served as warm-up act in Ohio last week. On FOX News yesterday, Gingrich likened the veep search to a certain reality show. NEWT GINGRICH (R), Former Speaker of the House: It’s a little bit like \"The Apprentice.\" You find out sooner or later who is the last one standing is. JUDY WOODRUFF: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie huddled with the candidate yesterday, after campaigning with him Monday in Virginia. Trump told The Wall Street Journal yesterday that he wants a running mate who can go on the attack to answer the attacks on him. That means going after his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. She appeared today in Springfield, Illinois, where President Lincoln long ago warned of a house divided. Clinton singled out Trump. HILLARY CLINTON (D), Presumptive Presidential Nominee: His campaign is as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes. It is built on stoking mistrust and pitting American against American. JUDY WOODRUFF: But Trump is also taking fire from an unexpected quarter, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In recent days, she told The New York Times — quote — \"I can’t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president.\" Ginsburg made similar remarks in other interviews, and Trump fired back in an early-morning tweet. He said Ginsburg — quote — \"embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot. Resign.\" It was amid that furor that Trump’s camp said he was aiming to make a final running mate decision by Friday. And we unpack it all now with Susan Page, Washington bureau chief for USA Today, and Robert Costa, national political reporter at The Washington Post. And there’s a lot to talk about, but, Susan, let’s start with the veep search on Donald Trump’s part, very public. What do you make of this process, including his children, and all these interviews? And does it come down to these three or four people? SUSAN PAGE, USA Today: This is just one more way in which Donald Trump has changed the way we view politics, how politics works. The vice presidential search is usually something that’s very coy. They’re talking to the people who are being talked about, say they’re not interesting or try to tamp down speculation about it. In this case, we have had tryouts in front of our eyes about whether they can be at a rally with Trump, how they connect with him. So that has been different, and I think that’s been a good thing. I think we’re seeing now is a debate between Donald Trump’s head and his heart, because his head says Mike Pence is a guy who rounds out his resume, who gives him some unity with parts of the Republican Party like evangelicals and Tea Party types that he does haven’t the best relationships with. But I bet his heart is saying Gingrich or Chris Christie or just guys he would prefer to be around and rather see in that debate against Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential candidate. JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Costa, what are you learning about all this? Where do you think Donald Trump is right now in this? ROBERT COSTA, The Washington Post: I think Susan’s spot-on with her analysis. What I’m hearing from Trump campaign associates is that Pence is at the top of the list for many of the family members who traveled with Trump today in Indiana. Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman, is also said to be inclined toward the Indiana governor. But that means — that doesn’t necessarily mean that Trump has made a decision. He’s flying to California tonight with a populist conservative from Alabama, Senator Jeff Sessions. And he is continuing to try to think through his options, wondering whether he wants an attack dog or, as Susan said, someone to round out that resume. JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Susan, so what does that say to us that it’s narrowed down to these four, and including, as Robert said, Senator Sessions from Alabama? SUSAN PAGE: Yes, and we’re not quite sure why Senator Sessions is on that list. He was an early supporter, and this may be a way to say thank you to Senator Sessions for standing with him. It tells us he chose only men. The standard political calculation would have had a woman in that mix as a finalist, especially since Donald Trump had some trouble with women voters. He didn’t do that. And it’s people who want to be on the ticket with him. He’s not coaxing somebody who’s reluctant to be on the ticket. He’s going to choose somebody who is out there comfortable auditioning for it. JUDY WOODRUFF: Eager for it. And, Robert Costa, what do you make again of the process? I mean, it stuck that he has his grown children in these meetings. How typical is that? ROBERT COSTA: It’s atypical. Trump doesn’t really function with a normal political organization. He counts on his family for counsel and some advisers. But this is someone who operates by making a lot of phone calls, bringing in friends and different people who he’s been with throughout his life and soliciting their advice, their take on the vice presidential search. And he’s getting a lot of political calculations thrown his way, but what’s most important to Trump, if you read his books or if you speak to him himself, he wants a rapport, he wants a connection, someone he can trust. JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, let’s turn to — well, we will find out soon enough. We’re told it is going to happen either Thursday or Friday of this week. Let’s turn to this really remarkable, I guess, series of criticisms that the Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has launched on Donald Trump. Very unusual. SUSAN PAGE: Never in modern times have we seen these kind of exchanges. When justices in the past have had a slip of the tongue, as Sandra Day O’Connor did on election night in 2000, it hasn’t been the kind of deliberate attempt we have seen by Justice Ginsburg. She didn’t just say this once. She said it to the Associated Press, and then she said it The New York Times, and then she said it to Joan Biskupic. So, this was a message she wanted to get out. And it’s managed to get The Post and The Times to editorialize on Trump’s side. So, that is something very rare in this election season. JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Costa, how is the Trump campaign seeing this? As somebody who covers politics, how unusual does it look to you to hear a Supreme Court justice going after a political candidate? ROBERT COSTA: It is unusual. But inside of the Trump campaign today in Indiana, they are framing the justice’s comments as condescension, condescension that Trump may try to use, in his mind, for political advantage by running as someone who’s politically incorrect, anti-establishment. They think this kind of battle playing out in public could be useful to Trump in the coming months as he tries to solidify himself as someone who is an outsider. JUDY WOODRUFF: That’s my question, Susan. What kind of — does something like this have consequences down the road? SUSAN PAGE: I’m not sure this is very — I’m not sure this has big consequences. I think if you agree with Justice Ginsburg, you probably think, hey, great, I’m glad she spoke up. If you disagree with her, you’re probably on Trump’s side. There are going to be a lot of things that are very important in this election. And I think this is one of the things that’s more interesting of the moment than something with lasting political consequences. JUDY WOODRUFF: The last thing I want to ask you both about is what’s been going on already in Cleveland this week, and that is meetings of different Republican committees. One of them has to do with the convention, one of them, Robert, having to do with the platform. It is looking to be a pretty conservative document. What do we know about that? What does that say to us? Should we even be paying attention to it? ROBERT COSTA: The platform is very ideologically conservative. And this is a way the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee believe they can make an overture to the elements of the Republican Party that are disgruntled about Trump’s nomination. And they are saying, look, Trump may be more centrist and populist on a lot of these issues, but when it comes to the party, we’re still down the line, even hard-line conservative. What’s most important here is that the Republican National Committee is trying to tamp down any kind of revolt or uprising among these delegates against Trump. And Republican Chairman Priebus is working closely with Trump to ensure that doesn’t happen. JUDY WOODRUFF: So, they’re using this as a way to tamp down disagreement? SUSAN PAGE: But they’re creating big problems for themselves with some of the groups that after that — in that autopsy they did after the 2012 defeat, they said they needed to do — they needed to do, for instance, more to reach out to young people, to African-Americans, to Hispanics, to gay people. This platform doesn’t do any of that. The stance on gay rights, on gay marriage is more conservative than the platform that was enacted in 2012. So, in terms of appealing, say, to millennials, this is not going to do the Republican Party any good. JUDY WOODRUFF: You were telling me that it has even language in there about requiring — looking at conversion therapy for individuals who are gay. SUSAN PAGE: It has language that approves of parents using this controversial technique called conversion therapy for their gay children. That’s something that even Chris Christie signed a law banning. JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly, Robert, so are these things that we can expect Donald Trump to try to implement? ROBERT COSTA: Unlikely. If you look at Donald Trump, he had a phone call in recent weeks with Caitlyn Jenner. He’s someone who comes out of Manhattan. He’s comfortable with people of all different backgrounds and orientations. He’s not a social conservative. He’s never really been a traditional social conservative, but he’s running to be the standard bearer of a party the Times Square has moved increasingly to the right. JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, some interesting questions. And we will be looking at it at the convention next week. Robert Costa with The Washington Post, Susan Page with USA Today, we will see you both.

In fact, having sex once a week is just about perfect. That’s the takeaway from a new study, based on surveys of more than 30,000 Americans gathered over 40 years, published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. After previous research found more wealth wasn’t actually associated with greater happiness, lead author Amy Muise began to wonder if the same was true for sex, \"an aspect of life that is thought to be associated with greater happiness,\" she says, per Time. However, researchers found that while couples who have sex once a week are happier than those who have sex less often, \"having sex more frequently than once a week was not associated with greater well-being.\" The findings held regardless of gender, age, or the length of a relationship. The study found couples who had sex less than once a month and those who knocked boots once a week reported a difference in life satisfaction that was even greater than that reported by couples who earn $15,000 to $25,000 annually and those who earn $50,000 to $75,000, according to a release. Muise isn’t sure why having sex once a week seems to be ideal, but it may \"be the frequency that people feel is enough to maintain their intimate connection,\" she says. The \"big problem\" one researcher not involved found with the study is that it identifies correlation, not causation. \"People are basically having as much sex as they want, and for some reason ... [those who do it] about once a week seem to be happier,\" George Loewenstein tells the Guardian (see his sex research here). As for single people, Muise says researchers found no link between sexual frequency and happiness among that group. (It turns out men and women want sex at different times of the day.)

The game wasn't a particularly close one -- Charli commanded over 80% of the total overall voteÂ -- so let's hope the NCAA final between Gonzaga and North Carolina on Monday night (Apr. 3) packs a little more suspense. In the meantime, thanks to everyone who voted and followed the Should-Be-Bigger Bracket this March, and let's hope by this time next year, Charli XCX has the same love and support across the mainstream as she does from the edit staff and readers of Billboard.

              "  'context': 'Changing hospital lighting so that it follows a natural light-dark cycle could help patients sleep better and experience less pain, a small new study suggests. Researchers from the Cleveland Clinic found that the lack of fluctuation between low light and bright light -- like a typical sleep-wake cycle, where it\\'s bright during the day and dark in the night -- in hospitals is linked with poor sleep, more fatigue and more pain among patients. For the study, published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, researchers examined the light exposure and sleeping patterns of 23 women and 17 men who were admitted to a hospital between May 2011 and April 2012. Researchers followed the light exposure, mood and pain levels of the patients for 72 hours each. Patients in general got fragmented sleep, and just 236.35 minutes (about four hours) of shuteye, on average, each night. An association was found between fatigue and bad mood and low light exposure, while pain levels were linked with fatigue. Meanwhile, \"higher light exposure was associated with less fatigue and lower total mood disturbance in participants with pain, suggesting the need for further investigation to determine if manipulating light exposure for medical inpatients would be beneficial in affecting sleep–wake disturbances, mood and pain,\" the researchers wrote in the study. Study researcher Esther Bernhofer, Ph.D., RN, of the Cleveland Clinic, said in a statement that future studies are needed to \"determine if lighting interventions could offer unique, cost-effective ways to more effectively address the problems of sleep-wake disturbances, distressed mood, and pain in hospitalized patients, providing for overall better patient outcomes.\" It\\'s not just hospital patients whose sleep is being hurt by light -- a recent perspective in the journal Nature pointed out that electric lighting could negatively affect sleep of the population at large.

First, he says he pissed himself as a five-year-old waiting for a chance to meet and get a picture with the Cleveland Indians first baseman after a game. Harbaugh also says there is a picture of him wearing the piss pants, which the world absolutely needs. Second, he is a straight-up lunatic about foul balls. Let\\'s deal with the incontinence first. Harbaugh and his brother John, who he says was seven at the time, went down to the field level at the old Municipal Stadium after the game to try to meet a baseball player. Then nature called. And there was–I think it was a first baseman named McGraw (note: can\\'t find a player named McGraw on the late-1960s Indians, but the blurriness is understandable; he was 5!). Might\\'ve been a third baseman. Anyway, I know we entered the field from the first-base side, just to get a picture with him. Just to get a Polaroid picture. And I had to go to the bathroom really bad. So I had to make a decision: Me and my brother were like 20 people from actually being able to go on to the field and take a picture with [the player] right by the first-base bag. And it was either go to the bathroom and not get a picture, or do it right there in my pants. So I chose to go in my pants and my parents have this picture of a big ring right here (points to an obvious place on the front of his pants). ... I\\'ve got to get my parents to see if they can get that picture. I\\'ve seen it through the years.

Not the kind where the third baseman runs off and tosses it into the stands. Legit. -Q: Not from the ball girl. -HARBAUGH: No, that is not counted. That is not counted at all. Tim, have you lost your mind? That is not counted at all. At all. Also not counted? College foul balls. Harbaugh has some from his time at Stanford, but they don\\'t count.

Niantic Labs has not responded to a request for comment about when the app will launch in other territories, but IGN will update this and the GO launch story should they provide further comment. The Pokemon Company had no official comment about when the app will release outside Australia and New Zealand, however, The Wall Street Journal\\'s Takashi Mochizuki was told by The Pokemon Company that it is asking U.S. and Japanese players to \"please wait a while\" for the app to launch in their regions. Despite the app, which allows players to capture Pokemon in the real world around them, not being officially available outside certain regions, users have already figured out how to download GO in other territories. For Android users, as noted by Eurogamer, the game\\'s APK file is available online from unofficial sources to allow players to download the game in the U.S. and the U.K. Directly clinking the link in the Google Play store at this time in the U.S. and Europe will not allow players to download the game properly. iOS users can change the region of their App Store to New Zealand or Australia or create a new account directly tied to those territories — however, both App Store territories require local payment information of some kind to properly register an ID tied to either region. So When Will Pokemon GO Officially Release Worldwide? While there\\'s no word from Niantic or the Pokemon Company about an exact release rollout, the way the game\\'s field test beta was released, in conjunction with its initial debut in Australia and New Zealand, could suggest when other players will have official access to the app. Pokemon Go New Images 46 IMAGES View Slideshow Return To Article Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC Pokemon Go New Images OF 46 Download The field test originally began in Japan in March of this year, followed by Australia and New Zealand in April and then sign-ups in the United States launched in May, with the beta having come to an end in June. While Japan still doesn\\'t have the fully released game, the staggered beta release schedule could indicate a similar region-by-region launch plan for the full app. The debut of the app will likely happen along a much shorter timeline, though. Shigeru Miyamoto revealed during Nintendo\\'s E3 livestream that the app is set to launch in or by July. It was later acknowledged in the stream that the app would need to be ready before its accompanying device, the Pokemon GO Plus Wristband. The GO Plus, which notifies users of nearby Pokemon, is already available for pre-order for $35 and is aiming for a July release, which would mean the app would likely be available worldwide in the coming weeks.

Cory Gardner (R-Colorado) sent a letter to Holder questioning the DOJ\\'s authority to override federal law. But Gardner\\'s concern isn\\'t simply with the legal ins and outs of recreational marijuana. What he really wants to know is if this DOJ decision sets a new precedent for states to opt out of other federal laws -- like President Obama\\'s signature health care package, the Affordable Care Act. Gardner writes: I write to question the Department’s constitutional authority on overriding federal law and seek answers as to whether this action sets precedent to allow states to opt out of other federal laws. While I commend the DOJ for finally issuing guidance after nearly ten months since Colorado voters legalized marijuana’s recreation use, its new policies are in contrast to the Controlled Substances Act. Essentially, DOJ policy now allows states like Colorado to opt out of federal marijuana laws. Do you believe the DOJ has the authority to override federal law? Do you believe you have the authority to change law without the approval of Congress? Colorado and Washington voters approved the use of recreational marijuana for adults 21-and-over last November. Last week in a joint phone call, Holder told the governors that the DOJ would take a \"trust but verify approach\" to the state laws. But the department is reserving its right to file a preemption lawsuit at a later date because marijuana possession and sale continue to be illegal federally, under the Controlled Substances Act. And that discrepancy between state and federal laws with regard to marijuana has Gardner wondering if similar logic could be applied to Obamacare as well. Via Gardner\\'s letter: Finally, the new DOJ policies seem to imply that federal authorities will not preempt state laws. Does this set a precedent for other areas? For example, several states have passed laws to opt out of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, yet the federal government has consistently said it will take over health insurance industries regardless of states that contest the law. If you do not agree that there is a precedent set, would you explain the inconsistencies of why in certain areas federal law may be deemed irrelevant, but not in others? Gardner is a vocal opponent of Obamacare and one of many Republicans who continually seek to have it repealed. Just before their summer recess, the House GOP voted to repeal Obamacare for the 40th time. And like their 39 previous attempts, it did not go any further with the Democratic-controlled Senate or the Democrat president.

Edgeworth, a seven-year-old firm, provides expert testimony mostly for companies whose very futures may be at stake, or what is known in legal circles as \"bet-the-company litigation.\" Its deep-data analysis helps big corporations and others win lawsuits and get a leg up on labor negotiations. Its métier is producing experts who can testify in depositions — the pretrial interviews that can make or break a case. \"I got my business skills in the Boy Scouts,\" said Johnson, a self-described \"geeky kid\" who became an Eagle Scout. \"Boy Scouts forced me to confront a bunch of things. It taught me how to get things done, identify strengths and weaknesses of people. I can remember learning the hard way that if you don’t get the troop to collect enough firewood, you have a big problem when it gets dark.\" Edgeworth has generated enough wealth for Johnson, its co-founder, chairman and sole owner, to afford a couple of nice homes here and on Martha’s Vineyard. He has had an impact on big issues, such as where the National Football League should place the ball on kickoffs and whether players’ careers would be shortened if the league added two games to the regular season (the answer was yes). His success also allows this numbers cruncher to moonlight as a radio-show guest, TV polling expert and author who distills his data into bite-size, digestible nuggets. He can discuss everything from autism to climate change to whether coffee causes cancer. Does living near a Starbucks increase your home’s value? (No). Do grilled-cheese lovers have better sex? (No). Want to know if your child will make more money if he or she plays high school sports? (It’s a contributor.) A lot of this is in his book, \" Everydata: The Misinformation Hidden in the Little Data You Consume Every Day .\" Most of those who testify for the company are economists, academics and statisticians with graduate degrees whose intelligence is off the charts. The company recruits PhDs at all the top universities, including MIT, Yale, Princeton, Chicago and Columbia. People from other consulting firms will also approach the company. The trick is taking that bandwidth and getting them to explain it like a game-show host. \"You must be able to explain complex concepts simply and directly,\" Johnson said. \"You must be honest, objective, a good teacher, and you must answer the relevant questions.\" Johnson wouldn’t identify his clients, but according to public records over the years, Edgeworth has represented Hershey’s, Bloomberg, Starbucks, Google and Hostess. Edgeworth has about a dozen people who testify, and they are paid well for their work. Hourly billing ranges from $500 to more than $1,000. That means the company makes money. A lot of money. There are small companies like dry cleaners or framing shops that are known in business school circles as NLOs — for \"Nice Living for the Owner.\" I regard Edgeworth as a really nice living for the owner. There is no debt on the company’s books, and Johnson financed the company himself. As with most professional services businesses, labor costs consume about a third of the revenue. There is also $850,000 in leases to be paid on offices in Washington, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Johnson said employee benefits amount to more than $1,000 a month per employee. That includes health, gym and transportation benefits as well as a 401(k) match. Johnson, 43, grew up near Buffalo and was blessed with smarts. \"When I was a kid, I was totally into school. I was always the best in my class.\" He earned a doctorate in economics from MIT in 1999 after getting his undergraduate degree from the University of Rochester. So he has some gray matter to work with. His doctoral dissertation sought to answer the question of whether long work hours lead to divorce. The answer: Not if you make at least $35 an hour. \"There was a cutoff point where more money meant it was likely that you were to stay in the marriage.\" Johnson decided early on that he didn’t want to stay in academia, so he and his wife came to Washington in search of opportunities. He went into economic consulting and took at a job at National Economic Research Associates. That was his baptism into the world of answering practical questions and learning about litigation and how to testify. He also managed teams of young researchers and learned how to manage the firm’s clients as well. Many were law firms trying to untangle a client from a sticky case. His first big case had all the sex appeal of a rope burn. It involved a product called Polyester Staple Fibers — tiny fibers that make up suits and rugs — and a class-action suit on price fixing. (It was settled out of court.) After seven years and a taste of everything National Economic Research Associates had to offer, Johnson launched Edgeworth, naming the firm after a 19th century Irish philosopher and political economist whose work inspired Johnson to create a collaborative culture that shared more of the firm’s wealth. After early success with the NFL Players Association, other big clients began to roll in. Revenue started climbing — from $750,000 in 2009 to $13 million by 2012 and $25 million last year. Edgeworth’s head count has climbed, too, going from six in 2009 to just under 100. As part of his collaborative culture, Johnson promotes his employees to become testifiers and give themselves a shot at some big bucks. He said he doesn’t hog the cases himself. \"We recruit the best and the brightest and turn them into experts,\" he said. \"I train people on how to improve their career. Nothing makes me happier than when a lawyer who worked with me calls one of my colleagues and says, ‘I want to give you an opportunity to testify in this case.’ \" Johnson is sitting pretty these days, with an expansive office that has a block-long view of 19th Street NW and is filled with sports memorabilia. A conspicuous trophy case houses his collection of professional wrestling belts from World Wrestling Entertainment. Go figure. Toward the end of our interview, I asked Johnson why he left National Economic Research Associates, where he had a sinecure and where a good future awaited him. All he had to do was wait his turn. \"I didn’t want to wait,\" he said. \"I had my own ideas of how to treat employees, how I wanted to develop business and how I wanted to create a culture. I learned early on in my career that it’s not only okay to be impatient, but it’s an imperative to advancing and getting to where you want to be.\" Do grilled-cheese lovers have better sex?

              "  'context': 'You know an apple is a healthier snack than a candy bar, but how do you make the big changes and eat real food all the time? Start here with these ten easy and delicious rules. 1. Rule #1: Eat Two Pounds Of Vegetables Every single day. \"Loading your diet with vegetables will naturally crowd out things you shouldn\\'t be eating,\" says Joel Fuhrman, MD, author of Eat to Live Cookbook, who recommends this amount after analyzing studies connecting vegetable consumption with overall health. Aim for one pound raw and one pound cooked: Certain cancer-fighting compounds in some vegetables, like broccoli, cabbage, and kale, are better absorbed raw, while cooking others (carrots, sweet corn) can boost their levels of antioxidants. Though two pounds might sound like a lot, a single sweet potato can get you a quarter of the way there. \"You don\\'t necessarily need to measure your food; just use this figure as a reminder to eat a hefty amount of veggies every day,\" Fuhrman says. \"Work in cooked greens and interesting stir-fries, and you\\'re set.\" Rule #2: Put An Egg On It So long as you have eggs in the refrigerator, you can throw together a healthy dinner in the same amount of time you\\'d need to order takeout. You can top a pita with a baked (or fried) egg and some cheese (see recipe below) or add an egg to a bowl of rice, dressed salad greens, or cooked vegetables. Get the recipe: Egg-Topped Pita Pizza Rule #3: Sub In Seeds These oft-forgotten all-stars come packed with key nutrients we all need: protein, healthy fats, and essential fatty acids. Toss a handful of hempseeds into the blender when making a smoothie, sprinkle chia seeds or flaxseeds on top of oatmeal, or swap sunflower or pumpkin seeds wherever you usually use nuts, like in this winter pesto, which tastes delicious spread on a sandwich or drizzled over roasted squash. Get the recipe: Spinach-Pepita Pesto Rule #4: Make Your Own Junk Food Sure, there are moments when no one can come between you and your potato chips. Which is why banning them isn\\'t the goal -- it\\'s making them at home. \"Junk food is wonderful,\" says Michael Pollan, author of Cooked. \"But it\\'s become so cheap that we eat it too often. When we used to have to make it ourselves -- and a long time ago we did! -- there was a built-in check on overconsumption.\" Take French fries: You peel the potatoes, cut them into matchsticks, fry them in oil, and make a mess in your kitchen while you\\'re at it. If you decide to go the DIY route, says Pollan, \"you will not do that more than once a month -- I promise you.\" Processed Food 101 Eating more real food doesn\\'t mean avoiding all packaged goods. While anything that comes in a sealed bag or a box is \"processed\" to some degree (the term simply refers to food that\\'s been changed from its original state), not all packaging automatically indicates a dietary no-no. Here\\'s what to look for. Buy Washed greens, sliced vegetables, and roasted nuts: They\\'re minimally processed, simply prepped for convenience. Packaged at their peak (to lock in flavor and nutrition), canned beans and tomatoes and frozen produce are also fine choices. But you don\\'t have to limit yourself to these. The real trick is reading labels: \"If you recognize most ingredients as food,\" says Darya Pino Rose, PhD, author of Foodist, \"or what comes from the ground or an animal, you\\'re in good shape.\" Skip Packaged foods with unpronounceable ingredients and processed with added sweeteners, oils, and preservatives to boost flavor and texture or extend shelf life. A few major culprits: chips, crackers, and microwavable meals you find in the freezer aisle. Says Rose: \"If it\\'s frozen with a lot of ingredients, you\\'re shopping in the wrong section.\" Rule #5: Prep Breakfast \"If you feel overwhelmed by the transition to eating more real food, just start with breakfast,\" says Lisa Leake, blogger at 100DaysofRealFood.com, who challenged herself and her family to avoid highly processed food and has never looked back. \"Most of us eat the same thing in the morning, so changing this one meal can have a big impact.\" Follow Leake\\'s lead and carve out time on Sundays to make a week\\'s worth of breakfasts, like these parfaits. Assemble the yogurt and fruit and store the parfaits in individual jars, one for each day of the week, in the refrigerator. Top with granola when you\\'re ready to eat. Get the recipe: Maple Granola and Yogurt Parfaits Rule #6: Build Your Bases Make your life easier by preparing batches of foods you can combine into multiple meals. Start with a pot of grains or beans -- or both -- every week. \"A pound of dried beans costs about $1. Once they\\'re cooked, it\\'s a snap to add them to any soup or salad,\" says Mark Bittman, New York Times food columnist and author of VB6 and the forthcoming VB6 Cookbook. Apply this strategy to roasted vegetables (broccoli, butternut squash) and dressed hardier greens (kale, Swiss chard). \"Don\\'t roast just two sweet potatoes; roast six,\" he says. \"The more you cook and have stuff around, the less you\\'ll depend on junk.\" Start with these fridge-friendly staples. Kale In a large bowl, combine 2 stemmed, chopped bunches of Tuscan or lacinato kale (2 pounds), 1 Tbsp. olive oil, and the zest and juice of 1 lemon. Season with pepper and massage until softened, 5 minutes. When ready to eat, salt to taste. Makes about 10 cups. Sweet Potatoes Preheat oven to 400°. Prick 6 medium sweet potatoes with a fork. Transfer to a baking sheet and roast until tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Herb-Tahini Dressing In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, add 1⁄2 cup roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley, 1⁄2 cup tahini, 6 roughly chopped scallions, 2 cloves garlic, the zest and juice of 2 lemons, 2 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar, 1⁄2 tsp. salt, and 1⁄2 tsp. pepper and pulse to combine. With the motor running, add 1/3 cup olive oil in a thin stream until combined. Makes 1 cup. Farro In a medium pot, combine 3 cups water, 1 cup rinsed farro, and 1⁄4 tsp. salt. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Drain excess water. Makes 3 cups. Store each base in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to a week and reheat as needed. Mix and Match Your Make-Aheads Tacos: Whole wheat tortilla + Sweet potato mashed with spoonful of plain yogurt + Dressed kale + Sliced avocado Kale Salad: Dressed kale + Herb-tahini dressing + Cooked farro + Kalamata olives + Thinly sliced cucumber Winter Farro: Cooked farro + Dressed kale + Shaved Parmesan + Toasted walnuts + Golden raisins Topped Sweet Potato: Split-open baked sweet potato + Cooked faro + Shredded rotisserie chicken + Herb-tahini dressing Rule #7: Eat a Vegan Lunch Each year, the average American consumes 175 pounds of meat and poultry, almost double the global average. Eating less red meat may do you a favor: It can lower your risk of cancer and heart disease. \"Learn to love big heaps of vegetables,\" Bittman says, \"and pile them on until you\\'re more than satisfied.\" To achieve that feeling, try meatless proteins, such as lentils, edamame (see the Soba Noodle Bowl, below), and tofu (\"so underappreciated; it\\'s a blank slate you can do a lot with,\" he says). \"Head to a place with options, like a salad bar, and experiment.\" Get the recipe: Soba Noodle Bowl Rule #8: Ditch the Whites White Flour The milling process strips the grains of most of their nutrition. The result: \"White flour digests in your body rapidly, which makes blood sugar spike,\" says Foodist author Rose. (Cue the almost inevitable crash.) \"It should be a supplement to your diet, not the main event.\" Try more-nutritious flours, like almond, coconut, and chickpea. One easy way to start: Substitute white whole wheat flour for 1/3 cup (or more) of the white flour in recipes. White Sugar Research suggests that sugar can be addictive. And it\\'s a sneaky ingredient added to processed foods that don\\'t even taste sweet, like bread and pasta sauce. Reach for organic honey or maple syrup instead; they\\'re less refined and offer small amounts of antioxidants. (Still, aim for no more than 24 grams of added sugar per day.) Steer clear of foods with sugar listed among the first three ingredients -- and that includes agave nectar, evaporated cane juice, malt syrup, and anything ending in \"-ose.\" (\"There are 1,001 code names!\" warns Rose.) Rule #9: Go with the Grains \"Ancient varieties are super-nutrient-rich and offer long-lasting energy,\" says Mollie Katzen, author of the cookbook The Heart of the Plate. And it doesn\\'t take much for quinoa, amaranth, and spelt to go beyond ho-hum: \"Once you add sautéed garlic or scallions, they come to life.\" These staples also add texture and heft when stirred into soups and stews and sprinkled on salad greens. Here are five ways to cook supergrains in less than 30 minutes. Rule #10: Don\\'t Ban Dessert \"You can totally build dessert into healthy eating,\" says Ellie Krieger, host of the Food Network show Healthy Appetite. \"If you say, \\'I\\'m never having it,\\' you give all things sweet an enticing, forbidden-fruit aura. When you inevitably give in, it becomes a mindless munchfest.\" Reach for better-for-you desserts like this clever chocolate pudding, made creamy by its secret ingredient: avocado.

We've already figured out how to make it through the weekend (read: curled up on the couch binge-watching TV shows on Hulu). However, deciding what to do with our hair before leaving the house requires a bit more thought. So what's the one hairstyle that can weather the storm? A French braid. The classic braided hairdo pulls loose locks away from the face without relying on dozens of hair pins -- an important detail when you'll need your hands to hold on to an umbrella or your coat. A French braid can also be worn by women with short or long hair. And when it's undone, it creates easy and effortless tousled waves. Scroll down for the step-by-step instructions on how to get this French braid hairstyle as seen on Chinese film star Zhang Yuqi. 1. For this look, it's best to start with day-old hair to achieve a better grip when braiding. You could also rough blow-dry hair to give it more texture. Soak up excess oil with a dry shampoo and wait a few minutes before you start styling. 2. Brush hair back and begin to braid, gathering strands from each side and working your way down. (Here's a video tutorial help you get it right.) 3. Secure the end of your French braid with an elastic ponytail holder and you're ready to head outdoors.

Sounds serious. In the meantime, officials tell ABC \"changes have been made\" in the wake of the report. Sound familiar? It should. More recently, the DHS inspector general’s office concluded a series of undercover tests targeting checked baggage screening at airports across the country. That review found \"vulnerabilities\" throughout the system, attributing them to human error and technological failures, according to a three-paragraph summary of the review released in September. In addition, the review determined that despite spending $540 million for checked baggage screening equipment and another $11 million for training since a previous review in 2009, the TSA failed to make any noticeable improvements in that time. 95 percent!

There’s still no cure for the common cold, for example. Our conditioner always seems to run out before our shampoo. And we still have no scientifically proven way to avoid blisters. Well, we can cross that last one off the list, at least. A study published today in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine reports a simple, cheap method for blister prevention—and it’s available in any drugstore. Grant Lipman is an emergency medicine doctor working with some of the blister-iest feet in the world: those of runners. \"What I kept hearing was, \\'Doctor, I\\'d be doing so well, if only for my feet,\\'\" Lipman said in a press statement. \"Their feet were getting decimated.\" Military doctors told him that blisters were keeping their patients from completing basic training. The angry sores that form from repeated pressure and friction, and the infections they caused, were hobbling our armed forces. \"People have been doing studies on blister prevention for 30 or 40 years and never found anything easy that works,\" Lipman said. \"I wanted to look at this critically.\" So he and a team of his colleagues in emergency and sports medicine put their heads together and decided to test one method that patients had mentioned again and again: paper tape. Paper tape, also known as surgical tape, is a mildly sticky adhesive tape used in hospitals to cover wounds. A roll of paper tape will run you less than a dollar at your local drug store, and anyone can apply it. Lipman decided to put the tape to the ultimate test: actual ultramarathons. These extreme footraces are legendary for breaking down runners’ bodies and minds . If paper tape could help runners get through an ultramarathon—in this case, the seven-day, 155-mile RacingthePlanet event—that would be pretty good evidence in its favor. RacingthePlanet runners literally become globetrotters, completing the race\\'s six stages in different parts of the world. Before the event began, researchers recruited 128 runners: 19 participants from the Jordan segment, 35 from the Gobi, 21 from Madagascar, and 53 from the Atacama Desert. Each participant told study staff about their personal blister history. Medics associated with the study then applied tape to one foot on each runner. If the runner was blister-prone, the medic stuck tape in areas of previous problems. Otherwise, the location of the tape was randomly assigned to one of four blister-likely areas: the toes, instep, outstep, or heel. Then the race began. By the finish line, 109 participants (that is, 109 feet) remained in the study. On those feet, the researchers found 97 blisters—but only 28 of those were located in taped areas. The cheapo paper tape had blocked blisters in 74 percent of runners. \"It\\'s kind of a ridiculously cheap, easy method of blister prevention,\" Lipman said. \"You can get it anywhere. A little roll costs about 69 cents, and that should last a year or two.\" Scientists Identify Cheap, Easy Way for Runners to Prevent Blisters |...',\n",

Words are like relationship baggage. They can lose their power over time -- especially when they\\'re used enough -- but they will always trigger the same subconscious response whenever somebody brings them up. They\\'re tricky little suckers whose psychological effects oftentimes sneak up on us when we don\\'t even know it.

Particularly when someone like Kanye West is talking about classism and inequality, or Richard Sherman screams in a little, blonde white woman\\'s face, or most recently, when Spike Lee candidly educates people about the problems of gentrification. \"Rant\" has become our go-to word to describe the inane topics and wordy arguments our ever-shortening attention spans have developed less and less patience for, even when those topics are relevant arguments we should, in fact, be spending more time discussing. The problem with describing these black men\\'s sentiments as rants is we write off their ideas as unimportant, mundane and imply that they\\'re somewhat mentally unstable. These men are on a tirade. They are loud and uncontrollable, and they have stepped outside the limits of what society deems acceptable behavior for black men -- and we all know what happens when white folks get nervous about black men acting out. Using the word \"rant\" has become our way of invalidating opinions, it\\'s our way of ignoring the issues we don\\'t want to see hold power because the word automatically characterizes the argument as unimportant before you even read what the person had to say. And of course, it\\'s not exclusive to its use with black men -- when I see it after Ted Nugent\\'s name, I automatically think fanatical, Tea Party Conservatives, but who wants to hear what they have to say anyway? (kidding) Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not saying everything that comes out of Kanye West\\'s mouth is comprehensible, but I bet you\\'ve missed a few great points he has made because you\\'ve written it off as \"just another rant.\" And I know many of you will think that I\\'m inserting race into something where it didn\\'t exist, but that\\'s the thing about modern-day racism, it\\'s usually a psychological and subconscious perpetration of pejorative language and ideas -- but I digress.

Photo: Stocksy People often tell you to make your bed because it ‘starts the day off well’ or that it brings order and calm. But the lazy among us have always known making your bed is a bad idea. For starters, it’s difficult to see the point of arranging all your throw pillows and stuffed animals on the bed if you’re only going to push them off hours later. If you have to leave the house early in the morning you’re probably all bleary-eyed and you don’t have the time or desire for tackling chores. Even if you thought about making your bed, as soon as someone nags you to do it, that immediately makes you not want to do it. It’s all very complicated. Plus, it’s harder to get comfortable in your bed if it’s been made and the sheets are firmly tucked in. (I like to create a cocoon out of blankets and fold all the sheets up around my legs, to the point where it’s stupidly warm, which is why bed-making is not for me.) Another thing to consider: if you make your bed in the morning, that means you’re telling yourself that you won’t be getting back into it for the rest of the day, and you just don’t need to place those boundaries on yourself. Finally, all these very valid points have now also been backed up by scientific evidence. Thanks science. According to reports, making your bed every morning may be bad for your health. The reason is dust mites; they don’t just look nasty, they are nasty. In the average bed there’s as many as 1.5 million microscopic mites crawling around and feasting off the skin cells you shed while you sleep. In the morning, if you make your bed immediately, all of the skin cells, sweat, mites and their droppings – which can cause asthma and allergies – will be trapped underneath. However, if the bed is left unmade, the mites, dead skin, the sweat, all of it, will be exposed to fresh air and light. So, if you have to make your bed it is better to wait until the evening. By that point your bed is much less appealing to dust mites and they will have died from dehydration or just lost interest. What you should do to mitigate allergies is wash your sheets every one-to-two weeks, use a damp mop or rag to remove dust and encase your mattress and pillows in dust-proof or allergen impermeable covers.

And these injuries aren’t just a playful little nibble, as the most common injuries are finger amputations, nerve damage, and scarring – nice... Wikimedia Another interesting canine fact is that men are far more likely to get attacked by a dog than women, because men are thought to be more aggressive and likely to attack a dog than a woman is. Animal psychologist, Dr Roger Mugsford, gave out some useful advice, saying: Once a postman befriends a dog, they will be friends for life. To say that dogs can smell fear I am sure is very true. The way we move and the way we think is communicated to a dog. Dogs are really good at picking up on people and they remember everything, so the best advice is to make friends with them rather than enemies.

              "  'context': 'Everyone has an uncle they\\'d rather you not meet. Please allow me to introduce you to Uncle Rhabdo, CrossFit\\'s unofficial and disturbing mascot. Uncle Rhabdo is a cartoon commonly referenced in CrossFit literature and representative of a troubling trend among CrossFitters. He\\'s a clown. Literally. The \"Uncle Rhabdo\" cartoon depicts an exhausted, yet well-muscled clown, connected to a dialysis machine standing next to some workout equipment. Concernedly, his kidney has fallen out and lies on the floor underneath him, along with some portion of his bowel. He\\'s left a pool of blood on the floor below him, but it\\'s not clear if this is from the disembowelment, the kidney\\'s arterial supply, or the collection of fasciotomies he appears to have endured. Uncle Rhabdo, of course, has rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis, apart from being a subtly pleasant and melodic sounding word, is an uncool, serious and potentially fatal condition resulting from the catastrophic breakdown of muscle cells. We\\'ll get more into the specifics in just a bit, but first let\\'s begin with a story. A Tale of Rhabdomyolysis One day, a very fit, young, physical therapist colleague of mine went to CrossFit. She had been many times before. On this warm Texas evening, she performed a partner workout, where each would trade off performing sets of 10 for each exercise. The workout consisted of pushups. Lots of them. Copious amounts of overhead press were also included. She performed hundreds of repetitions of each. She was a champ! \"I didn\\'t want to not match my partner. Normally I may have rested a little, but the partner workout kept me going.\" Both of these activities heavily involve the triceps muscles and so she wasn\\'t surprised to have her beautiful, sculpted arms feel like poorly set bowls of JELL-O on the way home from CrossFit. Perhaps it was the heat. Maybe it was the sheer number of exercises she did. Her muscles were in crisis. She iced and hydrated when she got home, like a good little exerciser, but the damage was already done. As physical therapists, we\\'re finely tuned detection machines looking for normal versus abnormal response to exercise and activity. \"Is this supposed to hurt?\" is a question we respond to hundreds of times in a week. Sometimes the answer to this question is yes and we encourage the individual to press on, and other times it\\'s a signal to initiate some rest and recovery. This signal detection is one of the things that\\'s deeply embedded into physical therapists. We can\\'t help it. And so when my friend awoke the next morning, her abnormal response alarms were blaring. She couldn\\'t bend her elbows! She couldn\\'t even reach her mouth to brush her teeth. Still entrenched in the CrossFit culture of deplete, endure, repeat, she quieted the alarms and stoically pressed on to go to work. It didn\\'t take long to realize she not only couldn\\'t bend her arms, they also had no strength. She wasn\\'t able to treat her patients. By that evening, her slender arms had continued to swell into plump hotdogs of ache and regret, and she was starting to come to the realization that the morning\\'s danger alarms were legitimate. Unbelievably, it took another 24 hours for her professional sense to break through the grip of the CrossFit culture, and seek medical attention. She was diagnosed with acute rhabdomyolysis, and ended up in the hospital for over a week. While in the emergency department they tested her creatinine kinase (CPK) levels. Normal is about 100. Her CPK levels were more than 45,000, a number that indicated damage to the kidneys. While in the hospital, she called to cancel her CrossFit membership. As is standard when something is cancelled, the CrossFit coach asked the reason for her decision. She replied, \"I\\'m in the hospital.\" The instructor quickly asked, \"Is it rhabdo?\" And here we have arrived at CrossFit\\'s dirty little secret. The coach was unusually familiar with what is normally a very rarely seen disorder. It\\'s so rare that one study reported the overall annual incidence of rhabdomyolysis to be 0.06 percent. That represents single digits of cases out of hundreds of thousands of patients. How, I wondered, is it possible that the layperson exercise instructor is on a first-name basis with a serious, yet rare medical condition? Is this a thing with CrossFit? It turns out it is. Rhabdomyolysis: As Told By CrossFit? A quick search of the Interwebs reveals copious amounts of information about rhabdo purveyed by none other than CrossFit trainers. Scouring the scientific literature in mainstream medical journals, however, reveals a only a few peer-reviewed papers. The science confirms that exertional rhabdomyolysis, as this form is sometimes referred to, is uncommon and normally reserved for the elite military trainee, ultra-endurance monsters, and for victims of the occasional psychotic football coach. Rhabdomyolysis isn\\'t a common condition, yet it\\'s so commonly encountered in CrossFit that they have a cartoon about it, nonchalantly casting humor on something that should never happen. So what is rhabdomyolysis exactly? Under extreme conditions your muscles cells explode. They die. They leach protein out into the blood stream, including one form called myoglobin. Ever stalwart, your kidneys take up the job of clearing these dangerous proteins from the blood. Why? It\\'s just what they do. Unfortunately, myoglobin proteins aren\\'t designed to be in the blood in the first place and they can easily overload the kidney. This can produce injury or death to all or part of the kidney in a short amount of time, and is potentially lethal. Locally, the muscles are left damaged and dying. Swelling ensues and weakness occurs as pressure builds around the remaining muscle cells. Your body\\'s systems that normally can assist with this local muscle damage are now offline trying to help you not die. If you get to this stage, you\\'re in serious trouble. In some cases, acute compartment syndrome ensues, which is an emergency condition that can result in loss of a limb unless your connective tissue is slashed open to release the swelling , a procedure called a fasciotomy. None of this is something that people should be handling in such a cavalier manner. So what gives? As early as 2005, the New York Times documented rhabdomyolysis associated with the culture of CrossFit in a piece entitled, \"Getting Fit, Even If It Kills You.\" The article included this gem of a quote: \"Yet six months later Mr. Anderson, a former Army Ranger, was back in the gym, performing the very exercises that nearly killed him. \"I see pushing my body to the point where the muscles destroy themselves as a huge benefit of CrossFit,\" he said.\" What does CrossFit\\'s founder, Greg Glassman think of this? \"It can kill you,\" he said. \"I\\'ve always been completely honest about that.\" Fast forward to 2013 and this culture has changed little, perhaps even accelerated. As Jason Kessler pointed out in \"Why I Quit CrossFit,\" the elitist, push yourself to the limit culture of the discipline has increased in light of commercial interests taking hold. Regarding culture, Jason points out: \"If you ask a CrossFit coach, the injuries were all my fault. In a culture that drives you to go as hard and fast as possible, it\\'s difficult not to get caught up in the hype. You\\'re supposed to push yourself to the limit, but when you hit the limit and pay the price, you\\'re the idiot who went too far.\" In another psychotic example of how the overwhelming culture of CrossFit can diminish professional common sense, one gynecologist was quoted dishing this nonsense: \"Ladies, in my professional opinion, it is okay to pee during double unders.\" No, peeing during a workout is not alright. Ever. To underline the point, MoveForwardPT.com, the official consumer information website of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), hosted an online radio show specifically responding to CrossFit\\'s irresponsible glorification of stress-induced urinary incontinence. The Impact of Rhabdomyolysis Sometimes rhabdomyolysis gets better with treatment. Sometimes it lingers. Sometimes your kidneys are never the same again. One message board commenter remarked: \"I seem to \"flare\" after any resistance training. I came into this by over training -- I was in phenomenal shape. I have gained weight. I get swollen and puffy. I feel as though the quality of my muscle tissue decreases on a daily basis -- more so than the lack of weight training -- seems to be disintegration.\" My friend experienced a similar, though thankfully less severe long term effect. It\\'s been several months and her triceps strength is not back to normal. Her sculpted arms are gone, replaced by semi-swollen jiggly tissue. Once a muscle tears, damaged, fatty scar tissue replaces the injured muscle tissue. The result is a permanently damaged muscle, and a decreased ability to strength train. The irony of pushups causing flabby arms underscores the age-old mantra: There really is too much of a good thing. CrossFitters, largely unaware of the rhabdo risk, will continue to charge ahead, pressured and happily coerced into exercising to depletion and exhaustion. My prediction: in a few years, the peer-reviewed scientific literature will be ripe with articles about CrossFit and rhabdomyolysis. Health providers will be there to scoop up the pieces, but who is there to protect those people unknowingly at risk? Exercise is just about the best thing you can do for your body, but in the case of CrossFit, we\\'re left to ponder the question, is this workout worth the risk? Can the culture adapt to one that embraces safe training principles? Do coaches truly have the ability to detect what a proper training load is for their athletes? Only time will tell, but the future of CrossFit may depend on it. Eric Robertson is assistant professor of physical therapy at Regis University in Denver, Colorado.

She did, however, mar what would have otherwise been a notably personable performance with one of her worst Goldman Sachs justifications yet. Clinton seemed genuinely flustered by the question—which is odd considering she had to have guessed she’d be fielding the controversy in some form tonight. Her acceptance of $675,000 for three speeches made to the investment firm in 2013 has been a major sticking point for Sanders throughout the debates, and Clinton potentially being beholden to Wall Street one of her biggest criticisms. But when Cooper asked if her speeches constituted an \"error in judgement,\" Clinton responded glibly, \"I made speeches to lots of groups.\" And when he pressed her on the hundreds of thousands of dollars she accepted from the firm, Clinton offered perhaps the worst answer yet: Well, I don’t know. That’s what they offered. Every Secretary of State I know has done that. \"That’s what they offered.\" An answer that A) doesn’t explain why she thought it prudent to accept that sort of money from Wall Street and B) doesn’t make any sense considering Hillary’s minimum for paid remarks is actually just (\"just\") $200,000. She also claimed that she’d done the speeches under the pretense that she maybe probably wouldn’t be running for president in a few years—which seems absurd to anyone who was even moderately awake that year. Hillary then went on to assure us that Wall Street has absolutely no influence over her whatsoever: But anybody who knows me, who thinks that they can influence me—name anything they’ve influenced me on. Just name one thing. I’m out here every day saying i’m going to shut them down. I’m going after them. I’m going to jail them if they should be jailed. I’m going to break them up. They’re not giving me very much money now, I can tell you that much. Fine with me. Of course Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein is making sure to stay out of the Democratic primaries as far as the public is concerned, knowing full well that his endorsement could seriously hurt his candidate of choice. Finally, Cooper asks if she regrets giving the speeches, to which Hillary responds, \"No, I don’t.\" But if Hillary’s not ashamed of her Wall Street money (because why would she be when she’s beholden to no one!), then why, as Open Secrets points out, did she conveniently misstate that just three percent of her donations comes from the finance and investment world when it’s actually somewhere closer to eight percent? And either way, according to The New York Times, Hillary and Bill \"have earned in excess of $125 million in speech income since leaving the White House in 2001\" with Hillary’s \"own speechmaking [being] a veritable tour through high finance.\" So those ties were already put in place well before this election, and they run deep.

But honestly, we\\'ve always wanted to know more. Like how is it possible to sell all those items so cheaply? And is that bargain-priced food actually safe to eat? Well thanks to Brandon, a somewhat-secretive Dollar General manager and his recent Reddit post—where he did an \"ask me anything\" Q&A—we now know even more about the popular chains. Here\\'s what we found most interesting about his insider information: 1. Dollar stores don\\'t sell items that are faulty or broken—they\\'re discounted for a different reason. \"I assume like any retailer the product is so cheap because it\\'s bought in massive bulk quantities (DG has around 20,000 stores to supply),\" Brandon said. \"To be honest, most of the products that aren\\'t food are made in China, so you can probably guess why it\\'s cheap.\" Most Popular 2. But there\\'s one precaution he recommends when buying food: \"It\\'s always a good habit to check expiration dates in any store,\" he said, \"but you should be A-OK if the store team rotates the food.\" 3. Yes, the stores are cheap, but the company is not. \"Normal starting pay for managers is 34-40k and is negotiable to some degree,\" Brandon explained. \"I\\'m in that range. I know another manager that\\'s been with Dollar General for 15 years and gets paid 80k. Your pay depends on the size of the store you manage, location, and time with the company. You also get bonuses but I split those with my crew.\" 4. And the company seems pretty strict. In fact, you can get fired on the spot for something seemingly harmless. When asked if he ever lost his keys, he replied, \"If you lose your keys you get fired instantly, so thankfully no.\" 5. The unofficial biggest seller may (or may not) surprise you. \"The biggest steady seller for a single item would have to be cigarettes,\" he said, \"around 600 packs a week sold at my store.\" 6. And the most shoplifted items are...odd. \"The two most shoplifted items is a tie between clothes and Tide Pods,\" the manager said. \"People were just slicing open the Tide Pod Pouches and dumping them into a bag. But I\\'ve seen a lot of stupid things get stolen like two packs [of] hot cocoa mix out of a box, a few trash bags out of a box, a few Ziploc bags out of a box that were only a dollar to begin with...tons more.\" 7. Laundry products are considered the best deals, according to his customers. \"I get told laundry products. Beer is cheap too, same with phone chargers,\" he said when asked what the best dollar store deals are. \"We have iPhone 5 and 6 chargers for $15, while the stores down the street sell them for $30-40. Most of are our products are cheaper than other big box stores apparently (been told this by customers). Greeting cards are a deal. Most are 50¢-$1. If you go to a place like Hallmark they\\'re about five bucks for the same ones.\" 8. And other dollar stores aren\\'t the main source of competition. \"Walmart markets are the competition and ever since four of them sprang up around my city, my district hasn\\'t been breaking last year\\'s sales,\" he explained. 8 Insider Things You Never Knew About Dollar Stores, Revealed by a Manager — Dollar Store Secrets',\n",

              "  'context': 'Bank of Hawaii is closing the accounts of Iranian nationals living in the state, a move that is angering Iranian activists and civil rights supporters. A national Iranian organization sent a letter to the bank last week protesting the action. \"Bank of Hawaii has made a business decision to close all accounts belonging to customers with Iran citizenship,\" according to a letter from the bank sent to 17 Iranian nationals in December. The bank cites U.S. sanctions against Iran, issued from the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the agency responsible for regulating the economic sanctions between the U.S. and Iran. \"U.S. depository institutions, including foreign branches, are prohibited from servicing accounts of the Government of Iran, including banks owned or controlled by the Government of Iran ... or persons in Iran,\" one of the sanctions states. The Bank of Hawaii letter noted that while the bank was aware the addresses associated with the account holders are located in the U.S., the bank is \"not able to prevent the operation of your account if, or when, you are in Iran.\" Taking Action Hamid Pourjalali, a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa’s Schidler College of Business, knows of several people who have received the letter; he believes it’s \"outrageous\" for the bank to take such action. \"This is an extreme case, because even in the letter they say it’s not based on transactions,\" Pourjalali said. \"The accounts are closing based on citizenship.\" The closures are mainly affecting students who are here on visas and others who live here with green cards. Pourjalali knows of at least one person who, once he proved his U.S. citizenship, was able to save the account. In a statement to Civil Beat, Stafford Kiguchi, spokesman for the Bank of Hawaii, apologized for the inconvenience to customers. \"In response to the customer feedback we received, we are working on a technology solution that may allow the reopening of these accounts, should our customers wish to do so,\" he said. Kiguchi noted that there are many Iranian citizens legally in the U.S. and that there are exceptions to the rules for some situations. \"However, if the person returns to Iran and leaves the account open, the financial institution is required to immediately restrict access to the account.\" Under Iran’s citizenship laws, anyone born there is automatically a citizen, as are the children born outside of Iran to fathers who are Iranian nationals, which includes many Iranian-Americans. Some fear this could lead to U.S. citizens having their bank accounts closed as well. Erich Ferrari is an attorney in Washington, D.C., who specializes in issues related to U.S. trade sanctions. He says he has never seen a case like this and believes the bank went \"way overboard.\" \"What’s problematic here is that Iranians can have dual nationality regardless of if they have a connection there or not,\" or ever go to the country, he said. An Iranian advocacy group is taking on the bank. Jamal Abdi is the policy director at the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), a grassroots organization that addresses issues facing the Iranian community. \"We strongly urge for Bank of Hawaii to reverse this discriminatory action and to ensure its policies do not violate constitutional and legal protections for U.S. persons,\" he said in a Feb. 24 letter on behalf of NIAC. Similar situations have happened before, \"but nothing like this,\" Abdi told Civl Beat. \"Nothing where the bank has stated that they are cutting off customers solely because of their citizenship.\" Last year, more than 20 Iranian students at the University of Minnesota had their accounts terminated by TCF bank, triggered by the bank\\'s investigations into transactions it believed may have violated the federal sanctions. The bank denied it was targeting international students. Students filed a complaint with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and the bank is now under an investigation to determine if there was discrimination. In 2012, TD Bank in Canada closed the accounts of Iranians due to the federal sanctions, although many who got their accounts closed were shocked and said they hadn’t tried to send any money to Iran. Caught Between Service and Compliance The timing of the account closures comes after the U.S. and other world powers agreed to a six-month accord with Iran that began in January, temporarily freezing Iran’s nuclear program and in return easing some of the economic sanctions, allowing for negotiations over a long-term deal on Iran’s nuclear program. Data from the 2010 census showed there were 370 individuals living in Hawaii that identified as Iranian alone or in combination. According to the NIAC, many Iranian students studying in the U.S. have had difficulty paying for their tuition and living expenses because of the sanctions that make it difficult to access or transfer funds that are held in Iran. Ferrari noted that banks operate under strict liability and have been known to refuse to service accounts to people they believe have a connection to Iran. Iran citizens have a higher risk profile, and raise red flags to banks, he said. Kiguchi said that it is difficult for the Bank of Hawaii to monitor when someone returns to Iran. \"We must be able to restrict their use of our internet, telephone and mobile services, or even their ability to write a check to access their accounts while in Iran, or we are in violation of the law. We are caught here between trying to serve our customer and being in compliance with U.S. regulations,\" he said. Abdi says he realizes the banks \"are put in a tough place\" with regard to the sanctions. \"I don’t think that the Bank of Hawaii is intentionally discriminatory against Iranians,\" he said. \"I understand that they’re doing this because of the sanctions. The sanctions are broad. The issue here, though, is that complying with them doesn’t give them a blank check to use racial profiling.\" Abdi says the bank\\'s reasoning, that it can’t control what Iran citizens will do with the account if or when the person returns to Iran, doesn’t hold up. \"Iranian Americans travel to Iran, other Americans travel to Iran, plenty of people travel to Iran. I’m not clear why they’re using Iranian citizenship as their criteria here,\" Abdi said. \"That’s not justifiable for cutting off a bank account.\" Kiguchi says the bank is hoping to reach a resolution to accommodate its Iranian customers within the next two weeks.

              "  'context': 'In a post-apocalyptic future, what might happen to life if humans left the scene? After all, humans are very likely to disappear long before the sun expands into a red giant and exterminates all living things from the Earth. Assuming that we don’t extinguish all other life as we disappear (an unlikely feat in spite of our unique propensity for driving extinction), history tells us to expect some pretty fundamental changes when humans are no longer the planet’s dominant animal species. So if we were given the chance to peek forward in time at the Earth some 50m years after our disappearance, what would we find? Which animal or group of animals would \"take over\" as the dominant species? Would we have a Planet of the Apes, as imagined in popular fiction? Or would the Earth come to be dominated by dolphins, or rats, or water bears, or cockroaches or pigs, or ants? The question has inspired a lot of popular speculation and many writers have offered lists of candidate species. Before offering any guesses, however, we need to carefully explain what we mean by a dominant species. Let’s Stick To The Animal Kingdom One could argue that the current era is an age of flowering plants. But most people aren’t imagining Audrey Two in Little Shop of Horrors when they envision life in the future (even the fictional triffids had characteristically animal features – predatory behaviour and the ability to move). Then again, maybe not. Triffid by Shutterstock So let’s keep the discussion to animals. This is for practical rather than philosophical reasons: by some standards the world is now and always has been dominated by bacteria despite the nominal end of the \"age of microbes\" some 1.2 billion years ago. This was not because bacteria ceased to be, or declined in prevalence, but rather because in our myopia we tend to place more importance on the large multi-cellular organisms that came after. By some accounts four out of five animals is a nematode (a roundworm), so from all these examples it’s clear that neither prevalence, abundance nor diversity is the prime requisite for being a \"dominant\" form of life. Instead our imaginations are captured by large and charismatic organisms. The Meek Shall Inherit the Earth I think you’ll be just ... like ... me. Mirror by Shutterstock There’s an undeniable degree of narcissism in the human designation of dominant species and a strong tendency to award the title to close relatives. The Planet of the Apes imagines that our closest primate relatives could develop speech and adopt our technology if we gave them the time and space to do so. But non-human primate societies are unlikely to inherit our dominance of the earth, because the apes are likely to precede us to extinction. We are already the only living hominid that’s conservation status is not endangered or critically endangered and the kind of global crisis that would extinguish our species is unlikely to spare the fragile remaining populations of the other great apes. In fact, any extinction event that affects humans will probably be most dangerous to organisms that share our basic physiological requirements. Even if humans succumb to a global pandemic that affects relatively few other mammals, the great apes are precisely the species that are most at risk of contracting any new diseases that drive us from the Earth. Will another, more distant, relative (primate, mammal, or otherwise) develop intelligence and human-like society? That too seems unlikely. Of all the species that were arguably dominant animals at some stage in the history of the Earth, humans are alone in their remarkable intelligence and manual dexterity. It follows that such traits are neither requirements for being dominant among animals, nor particularly likely traits to evolve. Evolution does not favour intelligence for its own sake, but only if it leads to higher survival and reproductive success. Consequently it’s a profound mistake to imagine that our successors are likely to be especially intelligent or social creatures, or that they will be capable of speech, or adept with human technology. So what can we safely speculate about the dominant species, some 50m years after humanity? The answer is both dissatisfying and thrilling all at once: while we can be reasonably confident that it won’t be a talking chimpanzee, we otherwise have no idea what it will look like. The world has seen a number of mass extinction events in the course of its history. The diversification of life following each event was relatively rapid – and the \"adaptive radiation\" of new species produced new forms including many unlike the ancestral lineages that spawned them after surviving the prior extinction. The small shrew-like creatures that scurried beneath the feet of dinosaurs in the late Cretaceous period looked very different to the cave bears, mastodons and whales which descended from them during the age of mammals. Likewise, the reptiles that survived the late Permian extinction some 250m years ago, which killed off 90% of marine and 70% of terrestrial species did not clearly foreshadow the pterosaurs and dinosaurs and mammals and birds that descended from them. In Wonderful Life: the Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, the late Stephen J. Gould argued that chance, or contingency, as he called it, played a great role during the major transitions of animal life. There is room to argue about the relative importance of contingency in the history of life, which remains a controversial subject today. However Gould’s insight that we can hardly foreshadow the success of modern lineages beyond a future extinction is a humbling reminder of the complexity of evolutionary transitions. So while it may be possible that, as many have speculated, the ants will take over the Earth from us, we can only imagine what their dominant ant descendants will look like.

              "  'context': 'This past Monday we shared a video that showed a performance test pitting Samsung’s brand new Galaxy Note 7 against Apple’s year-old iPhone 6s. Instead of relying on benchmark testing to compare the two phones, this particular test used a different method intended to compare their performance during real-world usage. The test wasn’t scientific by any means, but the unique format actually does to a pretty decent job of comparing two phones in a real-world setting. Benchmark tests, after all, really only test the capabilities of a smartphone when it’s pushed to its limits. How often do you push your phone to its limits in the real world? In this aforementioned performance test, Apple’s year-old iPhone positively clobbered the brand-spanking-new Galaxy Note 7. Apple fans and Android fans have all been quite vocal about the results since then, but does this test even really matter? MUST SEE: Apple’s iPhone 8 will feature the radical redesign we’ve been waiting for The video in question has already been viewed more than 1 million times, which shows you just how intense this debate has been. To put that in perspective, most other recent videos posted by the same YouTube user each have view stats in the tens of thousands. Here’s the video in question: The methodology here uses app laps to compare smartphone performance. The YouTuber opens the same series of apps one after the other on both phones and times how long the entire series — or \"lap\" — takes. He does two laps with each phone and then compares the results. In a nutshell, the thinking here is that this type of performance test paints a more accurate picture of how a smartphone performs in the real world. After all, you don’t spend most of your time playing insanely complex 3D games on your phone, do you? No, you open apps, switch apps and perform simple tasks most of the time. In this particular test, the iPhone 6s from 2015 beat Samsung’s brand new Galaxy Note 7 by more than 40 seconds on the first lap — the 6s took 1:22 to complete the lap, while the Note 7 took 2:05. As if that beating weren’t brutal enough, the gap widened to nearly a full minute on the second lap. So... a year-old iPhone with a dual-core processor and 2GB of RAM completely annihilated a brand new flagship Android phone with a quad-core chipset and 4GB of RAM. But does it really matter? There are certainly arguments on both sides of the fence but in the end, yes, it matters. Samsung’s new Galaxy Note 7 is a fantastic smartphone. As we noted in our Galaxy Note 7 review last week, the hardware is phenomenal and the Note-specific software features are outstanding. One thing we brushed by and didn’t really dive into, however, is that the new Note 7 isn’t entirely \"new,\" so to speak. While Samsung’s Note lineup has offered various upgrades over same-year Galaxy S phones in the past, this year Samsung decided to use the same expect processor, camera, and other components from the Galaxy S7. Is that such a bad thing? On its own, no, it’s not a bad thing. The Note 7 offers a very smooth user experience compared to other Android phones, and it has more than enough power to handle heavy lifting. But the Samsung phone’s 6-month-old specs draw attention to the fact that iOS is still far smoother and more responsive than Android. As you can see on Apple’s year-old iPhone 6s, apps are lightning fast. There are a number of important factors that contribute to the iPhone’s silky smooth user experience, such as a powerful custom A9 chipset and optimizations in both third-party apps and iOS itself. This all becomes far more important next month, when Apple releases its next-generation iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple manages to make huge performance gains each year with its new iPhones, and last year’s iPhone 6s is already faster than any flagship Android phone by a landslide. The iPhone 7 is truly going to be in a league of its own. Does it even matter that last year’s iPhone 6s is so much faster than the new Galaxy Note 7?',\n",

              "  'context': 'Fine, here’s what happened to Andy’s dad. A few months ago, I argued the theory that Andy’s mother is actually Emily, the girl who originally owned Jesse in Toy Story 2. The post quickly went viral, as many people began debating whether or not this is true, intentional, etc. Since then, literally hundreds (if not thousands) of people have been asking me about Andy’s dad, and I’ve never wanted to address the issue for a few key reasons: It’s depressing. It’s depressing. It’s depressing. You see, I love talking about theories like Andy’s mom and how all of the Pixar movies are connected because that’s tons of fun to think about. Andy’s dad? That’s just...well, you get it. But I can see that a lot of you want to know anyway, and it’s really not that complicated. In fact, this is one of the few theories about Toy Story that I can confidently say is totally intentional. The original theory was first posited by Jess Nevins, an incredibly talented writer who published his take on \"Mr. Davis\" back in 2010. I’ll elaborate on his theory and build upon it with my own insights. Nevins claimed that Andy’s parents are going through a divorce during the events of the first Toy Story. Now, many of you probably saw that coming (it’s pretty obvious, after all), but it’s important to point out that this is not an amicable divorce. Andy’s dad left the family, and there’s plenty of evidence to confirm this. Keep in mind that Andy’s dad is never mentioned or seen throughout the Toy Story movies. If it wasn’t for the rudiments of biology and procreation, then we could just assume that the guy doesn’t even exist. But he does, and all signs point to him walking out on his wife and kids. The Obvious Clues He may have left right before the first Toy Story started or months before, but one thing is certain: Andy’s dad did not die. If he had died, then why are there no pictures of him on the wall in the Davis house? As you can see from this shot of Toy Story, Andy’s dad is not depicted in these family photos. If he had died, you’d think they would at least keep a picture of him up for the sake of honoring his memory. Of course, you can argue that he died a long time ago, and the family has forgotten about him already. But if that’s the case, then how do you explain the fact that Molly (Andy’s younger sister) is a baby? He would’ve had to have died recently in order for her existence to be possible. It makes more sense to assume that his pictures were taken down, and it would take something despicable on his part for that to happen. To strengthen that point, Andy’s mom is spotted without a wedding ring at Andy’s birthday party in the first film. If Mr. Davis had died recently, then she would probably still be wearing it. Now, I’ll admit that if you really want to, you can come up with a lot of diverting theories to explain all of this by saying Molly was conceived by some other man and that could be why the parents divorced. You could argue that the kids are adopted, or Andy’s mom just \"gets around.\" But don’t you think the creators of Toy Story intended for this to be clear? In this case, the simple explanation is the more likely. After all, the family is moving from a bigger house to a noticeably smaller one in Toy Story, which signals that Andy’s mom is having financial trouble. If she and Mr. Davis were getting a divorce, then he would at least be paying child support, but the family still has to make some sacrifices. Oh, and the family gets a puppy. That’s pretty much the king of single mother clichés. Childish Competition The \"deadbeat dad\" theory also explains why Andy is so deeply connected with his toys, especially the masculine figureheads depicted by Woody and Buzz (who are both authoritative models as a \"sheriff\" and a \"space ranger\"). What seems like a petty rivalry between two toys vying for Andy’s affection is really an allegory that Andy is playing out in his mind. In the end, their reconciliation and eventual friendship is symbolic of Andy coming to terms with only having his mother around. Woody is the \"old\" father figure that represents where Andy really comes from, while Buzz is the \"new\" future he has to get used to. It’s no wonder Andy is going through emotional whiplash as he has to face the absence of his father and having to move to a totally new house within such a limited amount of time. Now, if you’re a fan of my theory of Pixar movies and the Pixar Detective novel, then a fun way to interpret this is by noting how Woody and Buzz are essentially \"programmed\" to make Andy happy. They may notice that he is torn by his old life and the new one that is being forced upon him, prompting Woody to obsess over making sure Andy still has a connection to his old life, while Buzz is the \"oblivious\" future that just happens upon Andy without him knowing it. A Common Theme Ultimately, this explains why Andy is so deeply immersed with his toys, and it’s a theme that Disney is no stranger to. In many Disney and Pixar films, the main characters are brought up without one or both parents. Movies like this include Up (Russell’s father left him), Tangled (Rapunzel is raised by an evil fake-mother and Flynn is an orphan), Frozen (both parents pass away), A Bug’s Life (Dot and Atta only have their mother), The Princess and the Frog (her father dies early on), Aladdin (Jasmine’s mother is never mentioned and Aladdin’s father is estranged until the third film) and I could go on and on. The simple explanation for this is that many people suffer from broken homes during their formative years, and it’s been reflected in both literature and moviemaking for as long as they’ve been around. It should be no surprise that a fun film like Toy Story has an undercurrent of sadness and (dare I say it) reality lingering in the background. Also, it’s been a tradition for movies and even TV to stray from having both parents onscreen in order to prevent alienating single parents who take their kids to go see movies. Ouch, right in the heart. What the Creators Have to Say About It Now, if you ask the director of Toy Story, Lee Unkrich, directly, then he’ll give you a mysteriously vague answer. In her article, \"Toy Story 3 and the Triumph of a Single Mother,\" writer Mary Pols spoke with Unkrich himself and gained his thoughts on the matter: \"It’s an oft asked question, but there is no concrete answer, We don’t mean to be mysterious about it; it’s just never been relevant to the story.\" It’s just always been that way. The decision was made really early on in ‘Toy Story’ to have Andy’s dad not be around. We’ve never addressed it directly, nor have we given any explanation for where he is or why he’s absent.\" As for Unkrich himself (pictured below), his parents divorced when he was 10 years old, and he reportedly grew up with just his mother for some time. On Quora, Craig Good (one of Toy Story‘s animators) claims that the decision to exclude Andy’s dad was made because rendering humans was very difficult and expensive at the time, and he wouldn’t be relevant to the story anyway. But that definitely doesn’t mean they didn’t pepper in a few clues that hint at Andy’s father being a deadbeat. That most easily explains why he truly isn’t necessary for the Toy Story movies, especially to the characters who moved on without him. Except for Buzz Lightyear, of course. Even he got a dad in Toy Story 2... Summary: So here it is in a nutshell. Andy’s father most likely walked out on the family, which led to Andy’s mother deciding to relocate to a smaller house to save money and (hopefully) move on from the painful memory. She has removed any pictures she has of him, along with her wedding ring, and the father is never mentioned or seen, even in Andy’s graduation photos. It’s sad and kind of depressing, but inevitably pointless to the story, which is really about a boy and his toys that somehow come to life and compete for his love and imagination.

              "  'context': \"It’s been a strange year in politics—have you noticed? Republican voters turned up their noses at what might have been the most diverse group of presidential hopefuls the Party has put on offer, settling on (way) outsider Donald Trump, who's headlining a riotous convention in Cleveland this week. Democrats will officially nominate Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia next week, concluding a fierce challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders that she and most observers hadn't anticipated gaining nearly as much support. And if the drama on this side of the Atlantic weren't enough, Brits narrowly voted to part ways with the European Union. There’s a single, powerful psychological force that makes all three of these political surprises a lot easier to understand: loss aversion. In general, we work much harder to avoid losses than we do to pursue gains. Here's how it seems to be working lately in U.S. and U.K. politics. Over the past few months, Trump, Sanders, and Brexit campaigners have all met success by reiterating the message that things are headed in the wrong direction—that sticking with the status quo is equivalent to a sure loss. Here’s a sampling: We tried it President Obama’s way—doesn’t work. He gave the world his apology tour. We got ISIS and many other problems in return. — Donald Trump The global economy is not working for the majority of people in our country and the world. This is an economic model developed by the economic elite to benefit the economic elite. We need real change. — Bernie Sanders If people feel they have lost control completely, and we have lost control of our borders completely as members of the EU, and if people feel that voting doesn’t change anything, then violence is the next step. I find it difficult to contemplate it happening here, but nothing’s impossible. — Nigel Farage Disavowing business as usual and calling for a clean slate is nothing new. To a certain extent, it's just how most politicians speak. But the the fact that these politicians in particular have each been this successful campaigning almost exclusively on such a message is remarkable. And it highlights a pattern in human behavior that's well-known to psychologists: Our aversion to losses is often powerful enough to cause us to take risks that don’t always make much sense (at least not in the modern world). There are lots of voters who aren’t just clambering for change; they’re willing to take a chance of making things worse in exchange for a chance at making things better. This isn't a political question, it's a probabilistic one. Suppose, for example, that you're facing a certain loss of $3,000. The person to whom you owe that large sum, however, is willing to offer you a type of lottery: You can spin a wheel (one that's been verified as legitimate and will lead to a fair outcome) that will come up red 80% of the time and green 20% of the time. If you spin green, you will owe nothing; if your spin lands on red, however, you'll owe him $4,000. What do you do? On average, the lottery is less attractive than just paying the $3,000 outright. That is, if you spun the wheel over and over you could expect to lose $3,200 per spin. But when faced with this decision in rose . On average, the lottery is less attractive than just paying the $3,000 outright. That is, if you spun the wheel over and over you could expect to lose $3,200 per spin. But when faced with this decision in a study , the overwhelming majority of subjects chose the lottery over the sure loss; their appetite for riskrose Our aversion to losses and our willingness to accept risk are closely intertwined. As of this week, Our aversion to losses and our willingness to accept risk are closely intertwined. As of this week, more than two-thirds of Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and the sentiment in the U.K. on the eve of the Brexit vote wasn’t much better . In other words, there are lots of voters who aren’t just clambering for change; they’re willing to take a chance of making things worse in exchange for a chance at making things better. If most voters see the status quo as a loss, the Clinton camp may be making things harder for its candidate than necessary. Without question, there are additional psychological forces that have contributed to the Brexit, Sanders, and Trump surprises (not to mention the political ones). Our tendency to focus on the present and our commitment to upholding the group, for example, Without question, there are additional psychological forces that have contributed to the Brexit, Sanders, and Trump surprises (not to mention the political ones). Our tendency to focus on the present and our commitment to upholding the group, for example, are two other tendencies that are both clearly at work . It would be wrong, too, to paint the policies of a candidate like Sanders and those of somebody like Trump with the same brush. But it's nonetheless true that loss-aversion is the obvious common thread tying these calls for radical change together. Brexit has come and gone, and Sanders has bowed out to endorse Clinton. Much of the rest of the U.S. presidential campaign will revolve around how the candidates frame themselves and their opponents. But the past year in politics has made one thing abundantly clear: If most voters see the status quo as a loss, the Clinton camp may be making things harder for its candidate than necessary. As recently as last month, As recently as last month, Clinton framed Trump as too risky and too negative, saying: We cannot put the safety of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump's hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America. This approach may fall on deaf ears among undecided voters who believe things are headed the wrong direction already. To them, such a risk isn’t as off-putting as Clinton might think. There’s a lot that can and will unfold before the election comes to a close in November. By my reckoning, much of what happens will depend on how undecided voters see the status quo—and how the candidates choose to tap into our natural aversion to losses. But for now, anyway, it's pretty clear what's working.

              "  'context': 'A tiny coffin with the preserved body of a three-year-old girl is probably one of the last things these workers expected to find when renovating a San Francisco home. But what made this discovery even more puzzling is what the little child was still clutching in her remarkably unspoiled hands. It all started when Ericka Karner decided to remodel her childhood home in San Francisco’s Richmond District. Karner was not actually around at the time, however, as she had moved to Idaho to live with family members while the work took place. But, as construction workers arrived at the house, there was no indication that this job would be any different from others that they’d done before. That said, this perception quickly changed not long after they began their work. Indeed, on May 9, 2016, three feet beneath the floor of the garage, the workers’ shovels hit something solid. So, instead of soldiering on, they took the time to excavate the object, and they couldn’t believe what they were seeing: it was a miniature coffin, about three feet in length. The two glass windows of the metal coffin unveiled the face of a little girl with pale skin and blond hair. Despite having been buried for a long time, though, the corpse looked amazingly well preserved. And, upon further examination, the workers identified one more interesting detail: the girl was clutching a red rose in her hands. As one of the discoverers later told KTVU, \"There were flowers – roses, still on the child’s body. It was a sight to see.\" The workers immediately contacted Karner by phone, informing her of the eerie find. The news was, quite understandably, a little creepy, but Karner did the right thing by contacting the medical examiner to open the casket and identify the body. The coroner who arrived on the scene estimated the girl to be about three years old and reckoned she had been buried sometime around the 1870s. It also became apparent that it was likely she was laid to rest at Odd Fellows Cemetery before it was shut down in 1890. In fact, most of the bodies from this cemetery were moved to a burial plot in the nearby town of Colma during the 1930s to allow for the construction of homes in the area. But, for whatever reason, this young girl was forgotten. And while the mystery made for an interesting story, Karner was soon told that the body was her problem because the girl had already been properly buried – so it wasn’t classed as an abandoned corpse. This meant that the city wouldn’t take responsibility for it. Worse still, Karner was informed that she would need a death certificate for the unidentified girl if she wanted to give her a proper reburial. Karner was understandably upset about the decision. As she told a newspaper, \"It didn’t seem right. The city decided to move all these bodies 100 years ago, and they should stand behind their decision.\" While several parties came forward with offers to bury the girl, the invitation came with a steep price tag. Indeed, one undertaker asked for $7,000 for the service, while an archaeological company asked for $22,000. To make matters worse, the body was now beginning to deteriorate, since the seal that protected it from the air outside had been broken during the coroner’s examination. Certainly, the coffin spent so much time in Karner’s custody that her two daughters even decided to name the little girl – Miranda. It wasn’t until city officials did some research that an alternative option was finally devised. They told Karner to contact the Garden of Innocence, a Californian non-profit that helps give unidentified and abandoned children decent burials. Elissa Davey, the founder of the organization, immediately had the coffin moved to refrigerated storage – until they could figure out where and when to bury Miranda. \"That girl was somebody’s child,\" she explained. \"We had to pick her up.\" A genealogist by trade, Davey opened the Garden in 1998 after hearing the story of a local infant who had died after being abandoned. She couldn’t get the story out of her head, and she decided to contact the coroner to claim the boy and give him a proper burial. Since then, the Garden of Innocence has laid to rest almost 300 unidentified children. And, far from just burying them in a casket, each child is also given an official memorial service that can be attended by local residents. Miranda herself was finally given a burial ceremony on June 4, 2016, in Colma’s Greenlawn Memorial Park. Her casket was carried in by fully-uniformed members of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization dedicated to charity that partners with the Garden. The ceremony lasted for an hour, with some 100 people gathering to mourn and pay their respects to the seemingly forgotten child. As the coffin was lowered into the ground, Miranda could finally rest in peace after 145 years of being lost. Miranda’s DNA was tested before the funeral, and that may lead to her true identity being discovered in the future. For now, though, she rests under the name \"Miranda Eve,\" with her tombstone reading, \"The Child Loved Around The World.

              "  'context': 'Harvard Medical School professor and researcher, Robert J. Waldinger sat down with TEDxBeaconStreet to discuss what makes \"the good life,\" according to a 75-year-long research project he is now leading. (TEDxBeaconStreet, Photo: Dave Rezendes) My grandmother once told me this little story that stuck with me. One afternoon at a doctor’s appointment, her doctor moved her large purse to another chair and remarked how heavy it was. \"You must be very rich,\" he said to her. \"I am,\" she said affirmatively. My grandparents lived modestly, still in the narrow two-bedroom rowhouse where she’d raised her family since her husband returned from World War II. They didn’t travel, eat lavish meals or shop at the finest department stores. Neither had careers that followed their passions. (She would have been an amazing teacher, he an exquisite artist.) Yet, she genuinely considered herself rich because she had a husband, children and grandchildren whom she adored. My grandmother knew what Harvard researchers have since confirmed: Relationships are the key to a happy life. [Your relationships are just as important to your health as diet and exercise] Robert Waldinger, a Harvard psychiatrist, took over the more than 75-year-long Grant Study in 2003, becoming the fourth person to run it. He recently gave a TedTalk on it that has been viewed more than 6.5 million times since November 2015. Waldinger felt it was important to do it. The federal government had spent millions on the study for decades, but everyday taxpayers didn’t really know what was discovered. And there’s certainly an appetite for knowing what makes a good life. The longest study of human development, the ongoing Grant Study is a decades-long project that began following the lives of Harvard University men selected in 1938 – among them President John F. Kennedy and former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee – and tracked every aspect of their lives. In the 1970s, that study teamed with a similar one that had been following a group of young men from inner-city Boston tenements since the 1940s. That has allowed them to contrast social status and upbringings, but otherwise everyone in the study is a white male. Periodically the men’s physical and emotional well-being are assessed. Recently that has included genetic testing. Many conclusions have been gleaned from monitoring these lives from young adult through old age, but to Waldinger there’s one clear takeaway: The happiest and healthiest participants in both groups were the ones who maintained close, intimate relationships. Waldinger, an Iowan who went to Harvard for undergrad and never left, has known the answer for years. He’s studied relationships his whole career and brought that perspective with him to the study. His first grant proposal as director was to invite the wives of the men – those still alive then in their 80s – to examine the impact of marriages on physical health. Those satisfied in their relationships were happier and healthier. It was that simple. \"People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely,\" Waldinger said in his TedTalk. \"And good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.\" Waldinger wants people to realize that the commercial projection of a good life – wealth, fame, career success – won’t bring them health or happiness. It’s the work they put into maintaining connections with other human beings that will. Quality and intimacy, as well as stability and consistency also matter. Casual relationships, like the ones forged on social media won’t do; neither will contentious ones like an abusive marriage or an unreliable friend. Most of the men in the late 1930s believed career achievement equated a good life. But Waldinger says it’s just as important to work harder on relationships. And for personal happiness, more so. Since doing the TedTalk, Waldinger has received hundreds of emails. He’s started a blog to continue the conversation about what makes a good life. He said messages range from, \"I always knew it was true, but look around and people act like it’s not what is important,\" to \"What if you are totally alone and have no one in your life?\" To the latter he recommends they seek out ways to connect with other people, perhaps by volunteering to help people who are lonely, like the elderly. \"It’s useful to know it’s a choice worth making,\" he said. His research has inspired him to make his own changes. In his field, there is a lot of pressure to continue researching and publishing. But he’s realized that it’s his role as teacher – the connection between mentor and student – that is more satisfying, so he’s invested more time in that. It has also spurred him to consciously reach out more to friends who are sick or struggling, even if it feels uncomfortable, because he knows how much that connection will mean to them. \"What we’d really like is a quick fix, something we can get that’ll make our lives good and keep them that way,\" Waldinger said in his TedTalk. \"Relationships are messy and they’re complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends, it’s not sexy or glamorous. It’s also lifelong. It never ends.\" So, go take that longer lunch break with your co-worker. Call a friend for a long overdue catch up. It’s good for your health.

              "  'context': 'Recently the scientific community has been abuzz about blood pressure, one of the most powerful contributors to heart disease. Doctors are actively debating how low blood pressure should go in order to protect against heart attacks and stroke, and researchers are focusing on what people can do to keep their levels healthy. Now, in a new study published in the journal Hypertension, scientists report on an unexpected connection to blood pressure: air pollution. The Chinese researchers, led by Yuanyuan Cai from Sun Yat-Sen University, analyzed all available studies involving air pollution and blood pressure and found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants, including ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, were more likely to have high blood pressure—readings above 140 mm Hg for the first number in the ratio—than those exposed to lower amounts of pollutants. Exposure to particulates, the tiny, hard-to-see particles of pollutants circulating the air, also contribute to higher blood pressures. The effect held for both short-term and long-term exposure to the pollution, and the increased risk of hypertension remained strong even after the researchers adjusted for other factors that could contribute to elevated blood pressure, including a history of heart problems and higher BMI. More research is needed, as the findings are the first to look at both short-term and more lasting effects of pollution on blood pressure. It’s not clear yet, for example, whether people who already have hypertension will experience even higher elevations if they live in polluted areas. The scientists are also planning to investigate further the connection between particulate matter and risk of hypertension. But Dr. Martha Daviglus, professor of medicine at the University of Chicago and spokesperson for the American Heart Association, says the results should serve as a warning to policy makers who may not take the health effects of pollution seriously enough. The findings should start a conversation about how legislators and regulators can start to improve air quality and potentially lead to better health for people, she says. In the meantime, doctors can \"remind the population about the dangers of hypertension by advising them to lower the salt in their meals, cook in a healthier way and exercise.\" On top of that, Daviglus adds, it might be a good idea to limit exposure to air pollutants by not going outside on days with high levels of pollution.

              "  'context': 'Ajegunle is known for being one of Lagos\\' toughest, most dangerous slums, but it also has another reputation - for producing some of Nigeria\\'s top footballers. So what\\'s the secret to its unlikely success? For a football-obsessed nation like Nigeria, talent can be found in every corner, but there\\'s definitely something special about Ajegunle, or AJ City, as it\\'s known by locals. Since the early 1990s, Ajegunle has been churning out football talent. Famous names such as Taribo West, Odion Ighalo, Brown Ideye, Samson Siasia, Obafemi Martins, Taribo West and Jonathan Akpoborie all started here. Life is not easy for many of the residents of this sprawling ghetto. They have to contend with high crime rates, as well the absence of running water, grid-powered electricity or healthcare. So what are the factors that contribute to Ajegunley\\'s footballing pedigree? Diversity, for one. \"It\\'s a community with so many people from different ethnicities,\" says Bennedict Ehenemba, a football scout for German clubs who is a native of Ajegunle. \"Ajegunle accommodates the Yorubas, the Igbos, the Hausas, the Itsekiris and all the other tribes in Nigeria. \"It\\'s a raw talent hub of Nigeria,\" he tells me. Many success stories can be traced back to two local institutions - St Mary\\'s Catholic Church and the Navy Barracks Camp. They remain safe places for many young people to play the game. Other open spaces are often claimed by so-called \"Area Boys\", unruly gangs who often demand a fee for people to play there. Super Eagles striker Jonathan Akpoborie, who made his name in Germany\\'s Bundesliga in the 1990s, also honed his skills here. \"This is actually the home of football in Nigeria,\" Akpoborie tells me, adding that the game is seen by many youngsters as a route to a better life. \"I don\\'t want to downgrade the area by attributing the success of footballers to poverty but there\\'s just nothing to do for the kids. \"They spend most of their time here playing football and in so doing they develop themselves and naturally become gifted footballers. \"In one national team there\\'s always one player who originated from Ajegunle. \"It\\'s exactly how I started - the grown-ups play first, we watch them play, then eventually we get in the field. They were inspirational to us.\" The slum also has an established system of grassroots football, which encourages talented youngsters to play competitive football for local clubs at an early age. This often gives them an edge over players at competing academies across the country. Alfred Emuejeraye, who plies his trade in the Swiss lower leagues, also grew up in Ajegunle. He believes the secret of the slum lies in its deep love of the game. \"The people here, the community are passionate about football, passionate about everything and are driven to succeed in whatever they do from musicians to taxi drivers... It\\'s an all-round community,\" he tells me. Odion Ighalo - formerly of Watford FC in the English Premier League but now playing for Chinese Super League outfit Changchun Yatai FC - is another Ajegunle native. Now he lives in some of the world\\'s biggest cities, but still remembers Ajegunle fondly. \"It was very tough growing up there. It\\'s not like in Europe where you have everything provided. \"You have to look for money to buy football shoes, jerseys, transport and even water for to drink after training. If you can\\'t afford the transport then you stay - and those who stay are great players,\" says Ighalo. Bolarinwa Olajide is a sports reporter with Lagos-based radio station Wazobia. He saw many of these players emerge from Ajegunle over the years. \"We see the hopeless, those who know they have a talent but they can\\'t exhibit it anywhere. They can\\'t afford fees to join a football academy, so they go to Ajegunle because they know scouts come to watch them play, and it\\'s a chance to show what they can do as footballers,\" he tells me. Leicester City and Nigeria midfielder Wilfred Ndidi did not grow up in Ajegunle but played against boys from the slum during his time at an academy in Lagos. He believes Ajegunle has produced good football players because the boys there \"work hard, the lifestyle is difficult so they try to work very hard and come out with their best.\" To keep the Ajegunle legacy going, some of the footballers are already giving back to the community with projects to nurture future talent. Akpoborie is helping to identify future football talent, while Ighalo is building an orphanage in the heart of the slum.

The 2-year-old royal is known simply as \"George\" among his classmates and teachers, a royal source confirms. The name will likely be written on his coat-and-backpack peg, and his teachers will write it for him on his artwork, says Louise Livingston, who is director of training at the Maria Montessori Institute , where many of the teachers at George\\'s school have studied. On Sunday Princess Kate – who has been continuing her advocacy for children\\'s mental health support – revealed her son\\'s possible career goals , sharing that he would like to follow his airman dad Prince William and join the air cadets one day. \"I am sure the Montessori teacher will have some pictures of airplanes to show him so she can teach him the names of different types of airplanes,\" says Livingston. \"It is always helpful to bond with children through their own interests,\" Livingston adds. George is adjusting \"very well\" to nursery school, which he attends part-time, PEOPLE was told last week . \"The process of settling in is important in all nursery schools, but in a Montessori environment it is particularly so because children need to be helped to adjust to the freedom of choice that will be offered to them,\" says Livingston. In the first few weeks, George\\'s teachers will have spent a great deal of time going over the rules that govern Montessori learning. \"They rest on the principles of respect for each other and respect for the things in the environment,\" says Livingston. The children pick up those tenets through play activities \"that help them to learn things like how to say \\'good morning,\\' how to push their chair back under the table so no one else trips over it, how to unroll a mat for their activity, where to place it so you are not in the way of anyone else\\'s activity and how to ask for help when you need it,\" she adds.

              "  'context': 'Look at this haircut. This man is broken, and you broke him. Look what you all did. Look at what you have done to one of the best players to ever grace a soccer field. You have broken him. When I first saw Lionel Messi with platinum blond hair, I was sure that it was a joke. A gross monster created in Photoshop by someone with a distaste for the man and human decency. The Dr. Frankenstein of soccer jokes. Only a godless man would disfigure Messi like this, and turn him into an affront to every virtue known to man. Something you would find in the darkest parts of Facebook. A meme that should have came with an unsourced quote about Messi’s evil twin brother who DJs in exotic Jersey Shore clubs. The only players who bleach their hair like that are bench players at Manchester City, who sit in their living rooms alone as the world forgets them (I know it was silver but I refuse to forgive Samir Nasri). Them and Arsenal midfielders who use the brightness of their hair to distract from their total lack of personality. Name Aaron Ramsey’s best personality trait. All you could think of was that he’s \"nice,\" right? Exactly. It couldn’t possibly be, I said to myself as I searched for more pictures of this new Messi. I was nervous. Fearful, even. My fears were confirmed when I saw the official SportsCenter Twitter account tweet an image of it. Look at this fucking guy. It’s like Frodo becoming the lead singer of a boy band that does a scatting song on the 1999 Tarzan soundtrack after leaving The Shire. Justin Timberlake didn’t dance in the rain with Timbaland humming like a Tibetan monk for this to happen. When he first got the tattoos, I was concerned. Messi has always been reserved throughout his career, his only sin was the floppy mullet that he wore in his early years. But we could forgive that. It was cute and it flowed in the wind oh-so-majestically as he turned Getafe defenders to eternal punchlines. Plus, it added to his Diego Maradona likeness. His whole image has always been of a boring, normal person. So, while tattoos are not as taboo as they once were, for someone who has been basic his entire life, it raised eyebrows. His first tattoo was of his mother on his back shoulder. Nothing wrong with that, some people love their mothers. It was also hidden so you can tell that he still had reservations about his look. Then he went and got his left foot tattooed. He desecrated a holy artifact. That left foot has done more for world football than the whole of England’s national team, and this bearer of the one-ring went and got a very ugly tattoo, of a sword enveloped in wings, with a soccer ball on one side and the No. 10 on the other. It was seeing an amateur graffiti artist tag his stupid nickname on Christ’s burial cave. If it had been up to me (and it should have been) I would have summoned that tattoo artist to the highest court in the land and had him tried as the unapologetic hooligan that he is. Next, he had a son named Thiago and tattooed the boy’s handprints and his name on the back of that same leg. It’s an awful tattoo and no amount of paternal love can change that. Then, he got the full sleeve on his right arm. It’s actually very cool, I can’t even lie. He has a tattoo of Jesus Christ that looks more like a confused reggae artist on his triceps but the rest of it is pretty nice. The lotus, the rose window of Sagrada Familia, is well done and gave some edge to Messi, who had \"drinking a Pepsi when told not to\" as the baddest thing he had done up to that point. This Messi looked like he would come to your city and sweep you off your feet with his nihilism and disregard for consequences before disappearing forever, leaving you to pine for what could have been. I wasn’t against any of this. I was shocked that he was going through this experimental stage in his late 20s but considering that he had lived in a soccer bubble his entire life, I understood it. He was discovering himself away from the sport. As someone who cared for him, I could only support him. Even if that handprint tattoo was a terrible idea, there was still hope for him. He could have been saved. Then the bastard went and grew out that disgusting beard. First of all, Messi is an ugly person. That’s OK, we can admit that. He looks like he jumps out from under bridges when you desperately need to cross, declaring that he will only allow you passage if you solve his riddle. Or that he will return your first-born child if you say his true name. Messi with a beard is ten times uglier. He looks like a real life garden gnome. Like a Snow White elf named \"Poor.\" It was his first cry for help. This platinum blond hair is the bellowing of a tortured soul. This is what happens to a person who watches Gonzalo Higuain cost him three finals. This is true sadness. The physical manifestation of the sorrow that forces a player to retire from his national team during his prime. If any hairstyle in the world could represent the words \"I tried everything possible. It hurts me more than anyone, but it is evident that this is not for me ...,\" it’s whatever is on Messi’s head right now. His new look, with the beard and blond hair, is Harvey Dent turning over in the hospital bed to show his disfigured face and shattered psyche after the Joker broke him. I blame all of you for it. When he needed people to guide him, you guys piled on more pressure. When he cried out to the world for a friendly shoulder, you guys gave him the cold one. And now look at him. Platinum blond hair and a beard that forest creatures could hide in. You’ve done what generations of defenders could never do. You’ve torn down Messi and reduced him to a poor man’s Justin Bieber.

What you see inside the microwave now doesn't resemble that bar of soap in the slightest, but this isn't some sort of magic trick. You're still looking at Ivory soap — the air molecules have just expanded and a transformation has occurred. This is the result of Charles' law. . In fact, he was the first individual to take to the air via a hydrogen-filled balloon in 1783, though there's no clear answer as to how high he rose and how long he was in the air. This is certainly a memorable feat, but what the Frenchman is perhaps best known for is his work that later became Charles' law. Jacques Charles was a French scientist and inventor whose most notable work came during the late 18th century. Charles was presumably the first to discover that hydrogen could be used as a lifting agent in balloons, according to the ChemTeam Charles' law, or the law of volumes, simply states that a gas tends to expand when heat is applied to it. This law was published in 1802 by French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who credited Charles for all his work on the subject, the ChemTeam reports. So, because Ivory soap is full of air molecules, it begins to expand when placed in the microwave. It's a pretty fascinating watch, as the bar of soap will writhe and wriggle until it nearly takes up the entire space. For those of you wondering, the soap can still be used afterward, it'll just be delicate and a bit flaky. This BuzzFeed-produced video features a few other science experiments that are great to do at home — especially if you have curious children around. One of the more interesting (and visually appealing) experiments showcases how water transfers through a plant. All you need is a white flower and some food coloring. Stick your flower in a cup of water, add a few drops of the food coloring of your choice, and over time you'll see the flower's petals begin to change color. This is a great science experiment for kids because not only is it exciting to watch, but it also teaches how water is absorbed through a plant. In another intriguing display, the presenter soaks a raw egg in vinegar for roughly two days. During that time, the egg shell disintegrates. According to Imagination Station , this is a result of the reaction between the acetic acid in the vinegar and the calcium carbonate in the egg shell. When the egg is removed from the vinegar and dropped from a few inches above the ground, it bounces!

              "  'context': 'The Iditarod dogsled race is an annual event during which human sled drivers, called \"mushers,\" are pulled through the frigid Alaskan wilderness by a team of up to 16 dogs. The exact path they take, from Anchorage to the town of Nome, varies slightly from year to year, but the course length is unofficially listed as 1,049 miles—about the distance from Memphis, Tennessee, to New York City. This grueling race has proved deadly to dogs for many years. Dog deaths are so common during the race that Rule 42 of the official Iditarod rules blithely acknowledges that some dogs’ deaths may be considered \"unpreventable.\" How then, in good conscience, in 2017, can an event known to cause animals to suffer and die be celebrated? As the 2017 Iditarod approaches, it’s important to remember the dogs who are injured and killed as well as disturbing facts about the race: At least 27 dogs used in the Iditarod have died just since 2004. In 2016, Nash died after being hit by a snowmobile during the race. In 2015, dogs Stiffy and Wyatt both died on the trail, and a dog named Stuart got loose and was later hit by a car. Countless dogs are injured. In 2015, they included dogs used by musher Yuka Honda, who crashed into a sled and was then run over by another–and Laura, a 5-year-old dog who, according to news reports, was essentially \"blind\" and often seemed \"confused\" but was forced to race anyway by Kelly Maixner. Dogs used in the Iditarod are forced to run up to 100 miles a day through biting winds, blinding snowstorms, subzero temperatures, and treacherous ice. Even with snow booties on some, the dogs’ feet can become cut, bruised, and raw from the vast distances of frozen terrain that they cover. The official Iditarod rules require only that the dogs be provided with a total of 40 hours of rest—even though the race can take up to two weeks. Most states have laws that prohibit overdriving or overworking animals, but Alaska does not. Dogs suffer out of sight off the trail, too. The vast majority of dogs used in sledding are kept chained up, with only overturned barrels or dilapidated doghouses for shelter. Dogs who aren’t the best runners are often treated like defective equipment. Dogs have been beaten, shot, abandoned to starve, or left at already overburdened animal shelters. Official race rules actually forbid mushers from saying anything negative about the race—and not just during their run but for an additional 45 days after they’ve crossed the finish line. Recent years have brought poor (and dangerous) trail conditions that posed a significant risk of injury to both humans and canines involved in the race, and this gag order has likely been placed in an attempt to keep concerns about such issues quiet. In their own words, Iditarod organizers declared that mushers \"shall not make public statements or engage in any public conduct injurious to and in reckless disregard of the best interests of the Race. This includes public statements or acts which are disparaging to any of the sponsors of that year’s Race.\" With rules in place to protect financial sponsors, it would appear that the business interests of race organizers trump concern for the health and safety of the dogs being used in this deadly event. Dogs deserve far better than a lifetime of isolation, cruelty, suffering, and death on the Iditarod trail. Animals all over the world continue to suffer in cruel, archaic \"sporting\" events. Whether in a bullfighting ring in Spain or on a trail through the Alaskan wilderness, animals’ lives should never be at stake for human entertainment.

              "  'context': 'An enormous carnivorous dinosaur that once roamed North America kept Tyrannosaurus rex from achieving its potential for millions of years, a new discovery suggests. The new dinosaur, dubbed Siats meekerorum, is part of a group of giant predators known as carcharodontosaurs, and it\\'s only the second of this group to be discovered in North America. Siats meekerorum in its marshy habitat keeps small-bodied tyrannosaurs from its kill. North Carolina State University paleontologist Lindsay Zanno discovered the Siats bones eroding out of a hillside in Utah in 2008. \"It\\'s easily the most exciting thing that I\\'ve found so far,\" Zanno, who heads the paleontology lab at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Science, told LiveScience. Lizard kings T. rex lived in the late Cretaceous period about 65 million years ago. Paleontologists know a good deal about the \"tyrant lizard\" and its ecosystem in North America, just as they know lots about the Late Jurassic period, the time of such famous dinos as Allosaurus, Apatosaurus and Stegosaurus, Zanno said. But between the two, there\\'s a 60-million-year gap. [Image Gallery: The Life of T. Rex] \"There\\'s a huge gap in our understanding of what lived in between those two really unique dinosaur ecosystems,\" Zanno said. For that reason, Zanno and her colleagues focused on 98-million-year-old rocks, right in the middle of that gap. As they excavated Siets from these rocks, they quickly realized they had something good. Two-legged theropod dinosaurs like T. rex have thin-walled bones. The Siats specimen shared this feature. At the time Siats reigned, T. rex had not yet evolved. Its tyrannosaur ancestors were scrawny things, no bigger than large dogs, Zanno said. At some point in the Late Cretaceous, Siats went extinct, clearing the ecosystem of its top predator and giving tyrannosaurs the room to evolve into giants like the recently discovered Lythronax and T. rex. Lost world Siats (pronounced see-atch) was a bruiser. The bones Zanno discovered belong to a juvenile, and conservative estimates suggest it was about 30 feet (10 meters) long and weighed 9,000 lbs. (4,000 kilograms). An adult would have put on another couple thousand pounds, Zanno said. [25 Amazing Ancient Beasts] \"It\\'s gigantic,\" she said. T. rex, at twice that weight, is still the undisputed giant of North American Cretaceous predators, but Siats is in the running for the No. 2 spot with another carcharodontosaur, Acrocanthosaurus, Zanno said. Acrocanthosauruslived about 10 million years before Siats, and Siats is in a different branch of the carcharodontosaur family, the Neovenatoridae. This is the first time a member of the Neovenatoridae has been found in North America. In Siats\\' day, what is now Utah was marshy and wet, positioned along the coast of the Western Interior Seaway, a shallow sea that once bisected North America. The researchers recovered most of Siats\\' backbone and tail, along with portions of its hip and back leg. They\\'ve also found at least three other new dinosaurs in the same-aged rock, Zanno said. \"In the next three to five years we really hope to be able to bring to light more of what this lost ecosystem looked like,\" she said.

We\\'re talking about the giant panda, a global icon that\\'s just been taken off the endangered list, largely due to Chinese conservation efforts. But how exactly did they do it? It\\'s all about the bamboo China has been trying for years to increase the population of the giant panda. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bamboo makes up for 99% of a panda\\'s diet The bears, China\\'s national icon, were once widespread throughout southern and eastern China but, due to expanding human populations and development, are now limited to areas that still contain bamboo forests. The success is due to Chinese efforts to recreate and repopulate bamboo forests. Bamboo makes up some 99% of their diet, without which they are likely to starve. Pandas must eat 12kg (26 lbs) to 38kg worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs. There are now an estimated total of 2,060 pandas, of which 1,864 are adults - a number which has seen their status changed from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\", on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)\\'s Red List. \"It\\'s all about restoring the habitats,\" Craig Hilton-Taylor, Head of the IUCN Red List, told the BBC. \"Just by restoring the panda\\'s habitat, that\\'s given them back their space and made food available to them.\" A loss of habitats was what caused the number of pandas to drop to just over 1,200 in the 1980s, according to Mr Hilton-Taylor. \"You need to get the bamboo back and slowly the numbers will start to creep back,\" he said. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are now an estimated total of 2,060 pandas Ginette Hemley, senior vice-president for wildlife conservation at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) agreed. \"The Chinese have done a great job in investing in panda habitats, expanding and setting up new reserves,\" said Ms Hemley. \"They are a wonderful example of what can happen when a government is committed to conservation.\" Yet this success could be short-lived. Climate change is predicted to wipe out more than one-third of the panda\\'s bamboo habitat in the next 80 years. Image copyright Wildlife Reserves Singapore Image caption Pandas must eat up to 38kg worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs \"With the change in climate, it\\'s going to get too hot for the bamboo to grow,\" Mr Hilton-Taylor explained. \"Giant pandas are very dependent on bamboo for food and with a loss in bamboo, it\\'s not looking very promising for them.\" So is captive breeding the answer? Many zoos and Chinese facilities have placed their bets on breeding giant pandas in captivity, sometimes using artificial insemination methods. Baby giant panda twins were on Sunday born in an Atlanta zoo - their mother had been artificially inseminated. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many scientific facilities now use artificial insemination methods to breed pandas Image copyright Getty Images Image caption But many of these pandas are used to a life in captivity, and are unable to return back into the wild \"Having captive animals is like an insurance policy,\" said Mr Hilton-Taylor. \"But you don\\'t want to keep them in captivity forever.\" The eventual goal of most captive-breeding programmes is to let the animals back into the wild eventually. \"There have been a couple of attempts to introduce pandas into the wild, but they haven\\'t been successful,\" said Ms Hemley. \"We\\'re not out of the woods yet.\" In 2007, the first captive-born giant panda ever released into the wild, Xiang Xiang, died after being beaten up by wild panda males. But why has the panda got everyone so obsessed? The Tibetan antelope is another animal that has also been delisted on the IUCN\\'s red list, yet more focus has been placed on the panda, which has come to be seen as an icon for animal protection efforts.

Forty layers in: \"You don\\'t really need to blend the foundation with your neck,\" she suggests. \"Ain\\'t nobody got time for that.\" Cakey foundation hack: Use a blow-dryer to set your foundation.

An alarming new study shows that it’s not just cancer, heart disease and other ailments we have to worry about when it comes to smoking: lighting up can also alter our DNA. A new study has found that smoking alters more than 7,000 genes in ways that may contribute to the development of these diseases, and don’t go away completely even when we stop smoking. Scientists based their conclusions on results from blood samples taken from 16,000 people in 16 other studies, finding that those who stopped smoking saw their genes recover for the most part within five years of quitting, showing that the sooner you stop smoking, the better. But the research team, led by Dr. Stephanie London of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Science, also found that some genetic changes remains 30 years later, according to the study. The researchers looked at a process called DNA methylation, which are genetic changes that don’t alter the underlying cold but can change how they are expressed. Decades after smokers quit, there was still a higher long term risk of common smoking related diseases. \"We used a pregnancy cohort called the Norwegian Mother and Child Study, or MoBa2 for short,\" London said in a recent podcast. \"And we used cord blood samples from the study.

In a survey of over 300 people participating in the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study, study authors found that among adults over the age of 50, having a busy schedule was associated with better brain processing, improved memory, sharper reasoning and better vocabulary. People in the study ranged from 50 to 89 years old, and the positive effect of busyness on the brain was consistent across age. This, the study authors conclude, suggests that keeping a busy lifestyle is important in middle age as well as old age. It’s possible that staying busy increases people’s ability to learn new things, as they may be exposed to different situations, people, and information on a daily basis, the researchers suggest. But it’s also possible that people with higher cognitive abilities are also more likely to be busier. The study cannot definitively determine that busyness alone causes better brain health. And what about the stress that can come from maintaining a tight schedule? \"We certainly considered that being very busy could hurt cognition,\" says study author Denise Park, director of research at the Center for Vital Longevity at The University of Texas at Dallas. \"Basically, the data suggest that the benefits of busyness outweigh the downside.\" Park says her team plans to further study the effects of busyness on the brain to hopefully further untangle the factors that improve or hamper cognition later in life.

              "  'context': 'One piece of NASA’s massive new rocket NASA / Via nasa.gov ID: 8562041 Space adventure fans might enjoy NASA’s latest saga, the story of a rocket to nowhere that Congress wants, very badly, built in Alabama. Or they might be really pissed off. In its 2017 budget request, NASA asked Congress for $1.3 billion to build its next jumbo rocket. Last week, despite years of fighting with the Obama Administration over its plans to explore an asteroid with the rocket, the Senate Appropriations Committee not only granted the request, but gave the space agency an extra $995 million to build it. A surprise billion dollars may sound good. But while adding money to \"Space Operations,\" the Appropriations Committee also cut $660 million from NASA’s science, aeronautics, and space technology programs that build the telescopes, observatories, planes, and landers that make the agency so beloved. In justifying this decision, the committee wrote that the rocket \"is the nation’s launch vehicle that will enable humans to explore space beyond current capabilities.\" The futuristic space rocket, called the Space Launch System (SLS), won’t send any astronauts into space until at least 2023, and it doesn’t even have a destination. But that doesn’t seem to matter to lawmakers. Since the moon landings ended, NASA is and has always been a jobs program, more about dollars spent on the ground than discoveries made among the stars, with the SLS bonanza just the latest example. \"It is more the politics of pork than the politics of progress,\" former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver told BuzzFeed News. \"There’s a long-time pattern at NASA where money aimed at science and research ends up with builders and contractors instead.\" Ratana Meekham, a technician at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama NASA / Via nasa.gov ID: 8562047 The Senate space spending committee is headed by Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, and on the minority side by Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, both of whom have NASA centers in their states. The SLS (nicknamed the \"Senate Launch System\" after it was forced on NASA in 2010), will be built at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama, where a $45 million 15-story test stand for the rocket reached its intended height earlier this month. \"The point is to spend money and create jobs the way the Soviet Union did on its rocket design bureaus,\" Keith Cowing of NASA Watch told BuzzFeed News. The SLS — \"a rocket to nowhere,\" as Cowing put it — fits this pattern neatly because it provides thousands of jobs in space states. No one knows where it will go. Maybe to an asteroid (the Obama administration’s unloved notion), or to circle the moon, or boost astronauts on their way to Mars. Eric Berger, a reporter at Ars Technica decried the move to build the rocket ahead of a destination. Cuts also came to NASA’s \"space technology\" funding, a $130 million bite meant to keep aloft earth-observing satellites run out of Goddard Space Flight Center, based in Mikulski’s state of Maryland. As Berger said, \"the motivation seems primarily to be keeping people employed.\" One problem with this approach is that you might end up with space rocket that doesn’t have any space technology — a habitat module, deep-space propulsion, landers — to actually let astronauts voyage to asteroids, or the moon, or Mars. You might spend billions on workers who maintain the rocket you’ve built, and not have any money left over to build the interplanetary survival gear needed to ever get to Mars, the ultimate goal of the space agency. It’s happened before, Garver said, with the the $100 billion International Space Station. \"We had to spend all the money just to get it built, with very little left for science.\" Scientists have long complained how little research takes place on the orbiting lab. NASA’s scientific advisory committee decided only this month to send a fact-finding group to the foundation that manages ISS research, after questioning its scientific productivity. NASA Watch / Keith Cowing / Via nasawatch.com ID: 8562044 \"The critics are right, this isn’t a rational way to run a space program,\" political science professor Harry Lambright of Syracuse University told BuzzFeed News. \"But that doesn’t matter, because this is the way a space program will inevitably work in a democracy.\" So it has always been for NASA, born in a moment of Cold War lunacy over the Soviet Union claiming the moon for communism, and looking for another space race to justify its budget ever since the glamour of Moon landings first wore off. In the 1960s, NASA administrator James Webb faced declining popular interest in the moon landing, responded by spreading NASA centers to politically important states, such as Lyndon Johnson’s Texas, California, Ohio, and Florida. NASA’s Stennis Space Center, which will build the rocket engines powering the SLS, is located in Mississippi, home to the chairman of the Senate’s overall spending committee, Sen. Thad Cochran. In a sense, that system is still working. NASA built the space shuttle in the 1970s in a decision largely shaped by Richard Nixon’s reelection campaign. Since then, the space agency has had to compete for Congressional dollars like every other federal agency, which means that politicians will always look to jobs as a reason for any Mars landings, Lambright said. \"They can’t spend money that Congress doesn’t give them.\" So, NASA will at least get a rocket out of the deal, he and others argue. \"NASA is actually doing a very good job, in my view, of navigating to build a rocket while they can,\" Lambright said. \"That is what there is money to build.\" The real problem, former NASA official Scott Pace of George Washington University told BuzzFeed News, is that the Obama administration’s plans to fly astronauts to an asteroid and then Mars are not very interesting to international or commercial partners, who would rather return to the moon. Building SLS lets NASA keep its options open if the next president decides to look to lunar landings instead, something that Obama seemed to rule out in a 2010 speech. Meanwhile, one commercial partner of NASA appears very much interested in Mars. SpaceX has announced that it will land an unmanned Dragon astronaut capsule on the Red Planet as early as 2018. That landing would depend on its yet-to-be-produced Falcon Heavy rocket, one almost as powerful as the SLS, carrying the capsule to Mars. Planning to send Dragon to Mars as soon as 2018. Red Dragons will inform overall Mars architecture, details to come — SpaceX (@SpaceX) ID: 8562055 That’s the same SpaceX that on April 8 demonstrated unparalleled rocket landing capabilities, by dropping one of its Falcon rockets onto an ocean barge after sending a satellite into orbit. Might SpaceX privately building a big rocket in the next two years, and sending something to Mars, make SLS look redundant to politicians, finally ending NASA’s long cycle of rocket-building jobs programs? \"That’s kind of optimistic, and I’m an optimist,\" said Garver, who served as a space policy advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008. \"I wouldn’t count on it.\" An artist’s rendering of the finished SLS NASA / Via nasa.gov ID: 8562049 ID: 8562045 4.

Prosecutors in Rome say they have their man. ROME — Stealing an expensive Rolex off the corpse of a foe is just the type of thing one might envision Tony Soprano ordering one of his petty thugs to carry out. Instead, James Gandolfini, the actor who played Soprano in the popular Mafia series The Sopranos, was the apparent victim of a similar postmortem robbery. On June 19, 2013, a few minutes after Gandolfini’s 13-year-old son alerted the reception desk at Rome’s Boscolo Exedera Hotel that his father had collapsed on the bathroom floor of their top-floor suite, a paramedic apparently swiped the timepiece from the dying actor. The paramedic, Claudio Bevilacqua, who was also the driver of one of two ambulances that responded to the scene, was called to trial in Rome this week on charges of aggravated robbery of Gandolfini’s $3,000 Rolex Submariner, which he allegedly stole while taking the pulse of the dying superstar. According to police reports, efforts to resuscitate Gandolfini were well underway when the theft allegedly occurred. Gandolfini, 51, suffered a massive heart attack while in the master bathroom of the suite he shared with his son as they waited for the arrival of wife Deborah Lin, who was set to join them on an Italian holiday before the actor was scheduled to be a keynote speaker at the Taormina Film Festival in Sicily. Gandolfini was still alive when he was taken to the Policlinico Umberto I hospital in Rome, but died shortly after arrival. Bevilacqua is not being charged with medical malpractice and is not believed to have impeded efforts to save the dying star. Members of Gandolfini’s family noted that the watch was missing and reported it to authorities and to their insurance company. An Italian police investigation into the alleged theft included surveillance-camera footage from the hotel corridor and testimony from two hotel security personnel, who told investigators that Gandolfini was not wearing the watch when he was removed from the luxury hotel. One of the security guards who arrived first in Gandolfini’s room noted that the actor was wearing his expensive timepiece before paramedics arrived. One of the security guards told police that he overheard the paramedics discussing Gandolfini’s watch, according to La Repubblica newspaper. \"He no longer has his watch on his wrist,\" one paramedic said to Bevilacqua, according to the security guard. Bevilacqua reportedly responded, \"Now let’s try to save his life, then someone can worry about the theft.\" Who Stole a Rolex Off the Dying Tony Soprano?',\n",

A source told Us Weekly they had been set up through friends and that the relationship was very new. The following month, the pair attended the premiere of HBO\\'s \"Casting By,\" according to E!

Believe it or not, dating has not always been easy for the blond Vogue cover girl. \"After my first Sports Illustrated cover, I felt terrible about myself for a solid month,\" she told Elle for the magazine\\'s September issue. \"Every single guy I met was either married or about to be married, and I felt like I was their bachelor present or something.

              "  'context': 'Photo: H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images It’s easier than you might think to get what you want out of someone you don’t know very well, or even at all — as Science of Us has previously written, research has shown people tend to underestimate strangers’ willingness to help them out, even when the request is inconvenient or weird. This is especially true if you ask them a second time, which makes it that much more awkward to refuse. Even so, it never hurts to stack the deck in your favor. And some research suggests that when you’re thinking about how to phrase your ask, there may be a magic word that makes it seem that much more doable: willing. As in, \"Are you willing to do XYZ?\" Psychologist Elizabeth Stokoe, a professor of social interaction at Loughborough University in the U.K., specializes in conversational analysis, recording and transcribing everyday verbal exchanges to try and understand their linguistic and social components. In a recent presentation at Latitude, a festival-slash-conference in Suffolk, England — think a British SXSW — she explained a common pattern that she’s noticed throughout her research: When a request framed in more direct terms is turned down, a follow-up with a willing will often get the other person to cave: Are you the type of person to mediate? Yes or no. What was really interesting about the mediation \"willings\" is that if you ask someone \"Are you interested in mediation?\" they might say yes or no. But if you ask them if they’re willing to mediate, that requires them saying something about the type of person that they are. That particular phrasing, in other words, tweaks the nature of the ask — a question that was formerly about an immediate action is now about a person’s boundaries, what they can find doable or palatable in a broader sense. \"So, if we change words, we change outcomes,\" she said (the full transcript of her talk is online at BPS Research Digest). With a caveat: \"‘Willing’ works best after resistance, so it shouldn’t be your opening gambit,\" she said. If the first approach fails, though, the trick can be a persuasive backup strategy. Now go forth and bend the world to your will. The Magic Word That Makes You Seem Extra Persuasive',\n",

              "  'context': 'A giant cloud of carbon dioxide bubbled up from Lake Nyos in northwestern Cameroon near the border of Nigeria on August 21, 1986, flowing into the valley below. It stripped the air of oxygen, suffocating 1,746 villagers and 3,000 animals to death. This may sound like a scary movie plot, but for the thousands affected, it was a very real nightmare. A hydrovolcanic eruption 400 years earlier created a crater in the lake, where massive amounts of carbon dioxide built up over the centuries. Volcanic rumblings continued miles below the surface, with gas seeping into the groundwater to create \"CO 2 -charged soda springs\" that bled into the lake, says Dr. George Kling, a biologist at the University of Michigan. When that cap is removed, it explodes like a warm, shaken Coke. The problem with CO 2 is that it builds up, \"like in a soda bottle,\" Kling says. No one can see the pressure building as long as the cap — in this case, the weight of the water — stays put and forces the gas to dissolve or be submerged. But when that cap is removed, it explodes like a warm, shaken Coke, with bubbles rising to the surface and a giant burst of CO 2 escaping into the atmosphere. Triggering the pressure’s release can be as simple as heavy rain or an earthquake. In Nyos, some boulders and dirt were the likely culprits, and Kling says he found evidence of a \"very large and recent landslide\" when he visited after the disaster. Dr. Njilah Isaac Konfor, a disaster-management and groundwater expert at the University of Yaounde in Cameroon, says there were reports of a week of rain before the event. Luckily, there are just three known lakes worldwide with these properties, and only two of these limnic eruptions have occurred in recorded history. The first was a much smaller explosion at Lake Monoun, also in Cameroon, that killed 37. It took place two years earlier, almost to the day, just 19 miles away from Lake Nyos. Volcanologists and engineers, Kling says, have been working to eliminate the CO 2 risk there ever since via six-inch pipes that pump out the gas. While \"unlikely,\" according to Dr. Greg Tanyileke of the Cameroonian Institute for Geological and Mining Research and the chief government scientist working on the lake, Lake Nyos could suffer another deadly eruption. Warding off such a calamity is an ongoing process, he says. Kling adds that, despite efforts to warn locals and help them make \"informed choices,\" many have returned to their homes and farmland because the soil there is so fertile, and farming is critical to their rural existence. But CO 2 isn’t the only problem. There’s also a rickety natural dam made of volcanic ash and rock at one part of the crater. If it collapses, the top 130 feet of the lake could come crashing down, causing a flood that \"would reach Nigeria\" and endanger 5,000 people, Kling says. Even worse, this could cause another imbalance in the lake and possibly unleash any remaining carbon dioxide still suppressed at the bottom. This \"double-whammy threat,\" as Kling calls it, is being addressed by an expensive but essential dam-strengthening project that is nearing completion. Even if Cameroon’s lakes are no longer a threat, scientists have their eyes on a far bigger lake in Central Africa with similar attributes. Lake Kivu, which lies on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, is 1,600 times larger than Nyos and contains 1,000 times more gas. It also sits on the Albertine Rift, where it is enduring increasing volcanic activity. This, combined with the fact that it has gas levels high enough to kill two million people along its shores if there’s a limnic eruption, makes it what Kling calls the \"largest ticking time bomb in the world.\" And scientists haven’t settled on what can be done to avert the danger. The lake is so big that the methods used to degas Cameroon’s bodies of water simply won’t work. Instead, the Rwandan government is trying to prevent a disaster and capitalize on the natural gas — the fifth largest methane deposit in the world — by carefully harvesting the deposits for electricity. But until this project is done on a larger scale, another disaster like the one at Nyos remains possible. Exploding Killer Lakes',\n",

Saying I\\'m not fashionable is an understatement. It\\'s not that I don\\'t understand that certain colors or patterns do or don\\'t go together, but I see clothing from a utilitarian point of view. If it fits and doesn\\'t seem objectionable, I\\'ll wear it. If what I\\'m wearing catches people\\'s eye (in a good way), I consider it to be a bonus. That said, I know a lot of people don\\'t share that opinion, which is why I turned to Trunk Club, a service that combines personal shopping with the mechanics of a subscription box. Here\\'s how it works: Trunk Club pairs you with a personal stylist who asks you a series of questions over e-mail. After you establish your budget, style, sizes, and which pieces you\\'re looking for, your stylist puts together a \"trunk\" full of clothes for you. Before it\\'s shipped, you\\'re shown an itemized list (with photos) of what the stylist has picked out. If you see something you don\\'t like, you can ask them not to ship that piece, and it\\'ll get replaced with another option. The consultation process is very professional and straightforward, which is great since it\\'s not something I\\'m used to. It\\'s also remarkably quick; I spoke to my stylist on a Wednesday, and the clothes were shipped to me that Saturday. Once you receive your clothes, you\\'re given a few days to try everything on and see which pieces you like enough to keep. I\\'ve always hated trying clothes on at a store because I always felt rushed, but that wasn\\'t a problem here. I was also able to mix and match pieces from Trunk Club with my entire closet\\'s worth of clothes, a luxury I didn\\'t get when shopping for clothes traditionally. I found a few pieces I liked (and learned what gingham meant), and sent the clothes I didn\\'t like back in the original trunk. Shipping is free both ways, and a return label is included in your trunk; and you only pay for the clothes you keep. My stylist called me to discuss which pieces I did and didn\\'t like and I was sent a follow-up trunk, which included clothes that were even more tailored to my taste. What sets Trunk Club apart from a clothing subscription service is that there\\'s no monthly, quarterly, or annual fee. You only get trunks when you request them, which is a nice departure from other services I\\'ve tried. I liked my stylist, never felt pressured to keep more clothing than I wanted, and didn\\'t feel like I was being talked down to as a someone who doesn\\'t know a lot about fashion. It\\'s not a cheap service (expect the prices to be in line with upscale retail stores), but I definitely found some value in it. In addition to learning about gingham, I also learned I loved wearing chinos and what a really nice belt looked and felt like. Patterns, styles, and materials may be obvious to people who really like fashion, but to an outsider like me, these were new, valuable insights. Using Trunk Club made me a little more conscious about fashion, and I was able to add fresh pieces to my wardrobe with almost no effort. If either of those prospects sound appealing to you, I recommend you give Trunk Club a try.  I revamped my work wardrobe with almost no effort with this personal shopping service',\n",

              "  'context': 'Okay, I was willing to give the benefit of the doubt here when I first saw an ambulance in Hillary Clinton’s motorcade. I figured it was a coincidence and had been there for someone in the audience. I don’t believe that anymore and here is why. The Clinton campaign tried to shrug this off saying that every presidential motorcade has an ambulance. That is simply not true. I have never seen an ambulance tagging along in a presidential motorcade. It is bad optics and makes a leader look weak. If you will remember, when Reagan was shot, one of his men had to drive him to a hospital. What gave me pause here was InfoWars. But Paul Watson is a good writer and a fairly reliable source there unlike some of the others. He says they had a reporter in Cleveland who saw the ambulance and a gurney being wheeled out. The EMS workers were in bullet proof vests. You can see it for yourself in the video below. The only rational explanation here is that it was a precaution for Hillary Clinton. We know she has something wrong with her and she won’t release her medical records. Anyone with eyes in their head can see she is not well. From InfoWars: EMS workers wearing bullet proof vests who had been traveling in an ambulance that was part of Hillary Clinton’s motorcade in Cleveland, Ohio earlier this week were caught on camera wheeling out a hospital bed, prompting more questions as to the state of Hillary’s health. Hillary suffered a four minute coughing fit during the event which prompted national headlines and an attempt by the Clinton campaign to pressure the media into not reporting on future episodes of Hillary’s ill health. Infowars reporter Millie Weaver reported how she was intrigued to see the EMS workers traveling with Hillary given all the questions about her health. \"I’m standing there waiting for Hillary to come out of her tent and the event was already running over an hour behind, so I had a feeling something was wrong, that maybe she was sick....and sure enough I turn right around and there is a gurney and there’s these EMS workers bit they are wearing what looks like bullet proof vests,\" said Weaver. The men seen in the video wheeling out the gurney emerged from the same ambulance that had been part of Hillary’s motorcade, according to Weaver and her cameraman. \"They were staged right behind stage waiting in the event that maybe she might have had something happen or maybe she fainted or fell,\" said Weaver, who noted how Clinton \"sounded so sick in person\" when she finally emerged from the tent to give her cough-addled speech. If this isn’t an indication of Clinton’s health, please explain to me what it is and stop lying about the motorcade. Hillary suffered a four-minute coughing fit that she never fully recovered from in Cleveland. Media outlets have had to cut her feeds because of coughing fits. She looks haggard and frail to me. Now, she is threatening the media if they don’t shut up about her health. Yeah, that’ll work... it guarantees a media shark swarm to blood in the political waters.
